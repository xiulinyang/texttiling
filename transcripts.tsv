62	transcript	transcript_Bed003	You want me to - Wait, what do you want me to do?	no
63	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Can you maximize the window so all that stuff on the side isn't - doesn't appear?	no
64	transcript	transcript_Bed003	No, It's O_K. It's -	no
65	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Well I can	no
66	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K, fine.	no
67	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Here, let's see if I can -	no
68	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Alright.	no
69	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Very nice.	no

74	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
75	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Perfect.	yes
76	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So then the features we decided - or we	no
77	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Uh the - the prosody, the discourse,	no
78	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"""to go"" and ""to visit"" and what not."	no
79	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"The ""landmark-iness"" of uh -"	no
80	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I knew you'd like that.	no
81	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Thank you. uh,	no
82	transcript	transcript_Bed003	of a - of a building.	no
83	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Whether the-	no
84	transcript	transcript_Bed003	and this i- we actually have a separate feature but I decided to put it on the same line	no
85	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"""Nice walls"""	no
86	transcript	transcript_Bed003	which we can look up because I mean if you're gonna	no
87	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And it's either because you're in	no
88	transcript	transcript_Bed003	The context, which in this case we've limited to	no
89	transcript	transcript_Bed003	the time of day,	no
90	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"and ""open to suggestions"", isn't actually a feature."	no
91	transcript	transcript_Bed003	It's	no
92	transcript	transcript_Bed003	uh, in this particular domain - you said - be - i- it could be on two different lines	no
93	transcript	transcript_Bed003	but are you saying that in this particular domain it happens the - that landmark-iness cor- is correlated with	no
94	transcript	transcript_Bed003	No. We have a separate	no
95	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Oh -	no
96	transcript	transcript_Bed003	They're separate things.	no
97	transcript	transcript_Bed003	their being nice w-	no
98	transcript	transcript_Bed003	feature.	no
99	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
100	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And - and -	no
101	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Like you could have a p-	no
102	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"By ""nice"" you mean -"	no
103	transcript	transcript_Bed003	You - Like you could have a post office with uh - you know, nice murals or something.	no
104	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right.	no
105	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"O_K. So ""nice walls"" is a stand in for like architecturally it, uh - significant or something like that."	no
106	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Or one time I was at this -	no
107	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Architecturally appealing from the outside.	no
108	transcript	transcript_Bed003	But see the thing is, if it's -	no
109	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
110	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah but if it's	no
111	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"Like you m- might be able to ""Vista"" it, right? And be able to -"	no
112	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
113	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
114	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Appreciate it.	no
115	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah, versus,	no
116	transcript	transcript_Bed003	like, I was at this place in Europe where they had little carvings	no
117	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
118	transcript	transcript_Bed003	of, like, dead people on the walls or something.	no
119	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I don't remember w-	no
120	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Uh-huh.	no
121	transcript	transcript_Bed003	It was a long time ago.	no
122	transcript	transcript_Bed003	There's a lot of those.	no
123	transcript	transcript_Bed003	But if you looked at it real close, you could see the - the in- intricacy of the -	no
124	transcript	transcript_Bed003	of the walls.	no
125	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K. So that count as - counts as a nice wall.	no
126	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right.	no
127	transcript	transcript_Bed003	The - O_K.	no
128	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
129	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right.	no
130	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Something you want to inspect at close range	no
131	transcript	transcript_Bed003	The -	no
132	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Exactly.	no
133	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Hmm.	no
134	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Robert?	no
135	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Well there - there is a term	no
136	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"And I was just wondering whether that's the same as what you describe as ""landmark-iness""."	no
137	transcript	transcript_Bed003	But it's really	no
138	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Hmm.	no
139	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Not a landmark at all.	no
140	transcript	transcript_Bed003	not a landmark at all.	no
141	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right.	no
142	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yep.	no
143	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah, we meant, uh, touristic reasons.	no
144	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
145	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
146	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Hmm.	no
147	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right.	no
148	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
149	transcript	transcript_Bed003	but you can imagine maybe wanting the oth- both kinds of things there for different um, goals.	no
150	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Hmm.	no
151	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
152	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right.	no
153	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right?	no
154	transcript	transcript_Bed003	But -	no
155	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
156	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Tourist-y landmarks also happen to be -	no
157	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Wouldn't - couldn't they also be -	no
158	transcript	transcript_Bed003	They're not exclusive groups, are they?	no
159	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Like	no
160	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Or it can be als-	no
161	transcript	transcript_Bed003	non-tourist-y landmarks and	no
162	transcript	transcript_Bed003	They're not mutually exclusive?	no
163	transcript	transcript_Bed003	direct navigational - Yeah.	no
164	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right. Right. Definitely.	no
165	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
166	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K, So our initial idea was not very satisfying,	no
167	transcript	transcript_Bed003	because -	no
168	transcript	transcript_Bed003	uh our initial idea was basically all the features pointing to the output node.	no
169	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Uh.	no
170	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So, a big flat structure. Right?	no
171	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right.	no
172	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yep.	no
173	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And uh, so we -	no
174	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Reasons being,	no
175	transcript	transcript_Bed003	you know,	no
176	transcript	transcript_Bed003	it'd be a pain to set up all the probabilities	no
177	transcript	transcript_Bed003	for that.	no
178	transcript	transcript_Bed003	If we moved onto the next step and	no
179	transcript	transcript_Bed003	did learning of some sort,	no
180	transcript	transcript_Bed003	uh according Bhaskara we'd be handicapped.	no
181	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I don't know	no
182	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Well usually, I mean, you know, N_ -	no
183	transcript	transcript_Bed003	belief-nets very well.	no
184	transcript	transcript_Bed003	If you have N_ features, then it's two to the N_ -	no
185	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And they wouldn't look pretty.	no
186	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So.	no
187	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah, they'd all be like pointing to the one node.	no
188	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
189	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Uh.	no
190	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So then our next idea was to add a middle layer, right?	no
191	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So the thinking behind that was	no
192	transcript	transcript_Bed003	we have the features that we've drawn	no
193	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Like, the someone s-	no
194	transcript	transcript_Bed003	The person at the screen is trying to communicate some abstract idea, like	no
195	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"""I'm -"""	no
196	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"the - the abstract idea being ""I am a tourist I want to go"	no
197	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right?	no
198	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So	no
199	transcript	transcript_Bed003	what they've said previously and whatnot. And then we have	no
200	transcript	transcript_Bed003	the means	no
201	transcript	transcript_Bed003	that they should use. Right?	no
202	transcript	transcript_Bed003	but the middle	no
203	transcript	transcript_Bed003	thing,	no
204	transcript	transcript_Bed003	we were thinking along the lines of maybe trying to	no
205	transcript	transcript_Bed003	figure out,	no
206	transcript	transcript_Bed003	like, the concept of whether they're a tourist	no
207	transcript	transcript_Bed003	or	no
208	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Or -	no
209	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yes, we could-	no
210	transcript	transcript_Bed003	things we couldn't extract the - from the data, the hidden variables.	no
211	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So then the hidden variables - hair- variables we came up with	no
212	transcript	transcript_Bed003	were whether	no
213	transcript	transcript_Bed003	someone was on a tour, running an errand, or whether they were in a hurry,	no
214	transcript	transcript_Bed003	because	no
215	transcript	transcript_Bed003	we were thinking uh,	no
216	transcript	transcript_Bed003	if they were in a hurry there'd be less likely to -	no
217	transcript	transcript_Bed003	like -	no
218	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Want to do Vista, right?	no
219	transcript	transcript_Bed003	or th-	no
220	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right.	no
221	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Or they might be more likely to be using the place that they want to go to as a -	no
222	transcript	transcript_Bed003	like a	no
223	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
224	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Whether the destination was their final destination, whether the destination was closed. Those are all -	no
225	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And then	no
226	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"""Let's look at the belief-net"""	no
227	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Um right now it's still kind of	no
228	transcript	transcript_Bed003	we didn't know the probabilities of -	no
229	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Well I'll talk about it when I get the picture up.	no
230	transcript	transcript_Bed003	No one knows it.	no
231	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
232	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So this right - what we -	no
233	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Let's see.	no
234	transcript	transcript_Bed003	But uh -	no
235	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So.	no
236	transcript	transcript_Bed003	The mode	no
237	transcript	transcript_Bed003	The	no
238	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Um -	no
239	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"The ""context"", we simplified. Basically it's just the businessman,"	no
240	transcript	transcript_Bed003	the tourist, unknown.	no
241	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"""Verb used"" is actually"	no
242	transcript	transcript_Bed003	personally amusing	no
243	transcript	transcript_Bed003	mainly because it's - it's just	no
244	transcript	transcript_Bed003	whether the verb is a Tango verb, an Enter verb, or a	no
245	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah, that one needs a lot of -	no
246	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And are those mutually exclusive sets? Right. Got it. Uh-huh.	no
247	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Not at all. That's - that - that needs a lot of work. But uh	no
248	transcript	transcript_Bed003	No.	no
249	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
250	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Simple.	no
251	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
252	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Stab at it. Yep.	no
253	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right.	no
254	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Um -	no
255	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Why don't you mention things about this, Bhaskara, that I am -	no
256	transcript	transcript_Bed003	not - that are not coming to my mind right now.	no
257	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K, so - Yeah, so note the four nodes down there, the - sort of, the things that are not directly extracted.	no
258	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"Actually, the five things. The ""closed"" is also not directly extracted I guess,"	no
259	transcript	transcript_Bed003	From the	no
260	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Well i- it's - it's so-	no
261	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Hmm.	no
262	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"Actually, no, wait. It is. O_K, ""closed"" sort of is."	no
263	transcript	transcript_Bed003	it sort of is because it's - because have the -	no
264	transcript	transcript_Bed003	the time of day and the close- it just had the -	no
265	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right,	no
266	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right, but the other ones, the final destination, the whether they're doing business, whether they're in a hurry, and whether they're tourists, that kind of thing is all uh	no
267	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Inferred from the other ones?	no
268	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
269	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And the mode, you know, depends on all those things only.	no
270	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah the -	no
271	transcript	transcript_Bed003	the actual parse is somewhere	no
272	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"Yeah. So we haven't uh, managed - Like we don't have nodes for ""discourse"" and ""parse"", although like in some sense they are parts of this belief-net. But uh -"	no
273	transcript	transcript_Bed003	up around in here.	no
274	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
275	transcript	transcript_Bed003	The idea is that we just extract those features from them, so we don't actually have a node for the entire parse, because we'd never do inference on it anyway, so.	no
276	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
277	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right.	no
278	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So some of the - the top row of things -	no
279	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Oh.	no
280	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Uh-huh.	no
281	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right.	no
282	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K. I see.	no
283	transcript	transcript_Bed003	There were - there'd be	no
284	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
285	transcript	transcript_Bed003	but	no
286	transcript	transcript_Bed003	you know,	no
287	transcript	transcript_Bed003	we didn't have -	no
288	transcript	transcript_Bed003	That was like our example.	no
289	transcript	transcript_Bed003	That was the	no
290	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
291	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K. So there are certain cues that are very strong	no
292	transcript	transcript_Bed003	From the discourse that -	no
293	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
294	transcript	transcript_Bed003	for one of those.	no
295	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And then in that second row	no
296	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So all of those -	no
297	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Some of them come from the utterance	no
298	transcript	transcript_Bed003	either world knowledge or situational	no
299	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right.	no
300	transcript	transcript_Bed003	One, uh -	no
301	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Uh.	no
302	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Um, anything else you want to say Bhaskara?	no
303	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Um.	no
304	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"""Unmark"	no
305	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah, I m- I mean -	no
306	transcript	transcript_Bed003	One thing - uh -	no
307	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah. They're - they're are a	no
308	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Uh.	no
309	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I	no
310	transcript	transcript_Bed003	uh, agree on what - what the meaning of these things is at the moment and maybe	no
311	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah, th-	no
312	transcript	transcript_Bed003	we -	no
313	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K. so one thing I - I'm	no
314	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"you know unsure about, is how we have the discus- uh - the ""admission fee"" thing set up."	no
315	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So one	no

317	transcript	transcript_Bed003	by doing the layers like this,	no
318	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Uh - we kept um - things from directly affecting the mode	no

325	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"right? Versus pointing to- just at ""tourist"","	no
326	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
327	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
328	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K?	no
329	transcript	transcript_Bed003	But	no
330	transcript	transcript_Bed003	we just decided to	no
331	transcript	transcript_Bed003	keep all the things we extracted	no
332	transcript	transcript_Bed003	to point at the middle and then	no
333	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
334	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Why is the landmark -	no
335	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K. The landmark is facing to the tourists.	no
336	transcript	transcript_Bed003	That's because we're talking about landmarks as touristic landmarks not	no
337	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right.	no
338	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
339	transcript	transcript_Bed003	as possible	no
340	transcript	transcript_Bed003	um	no
341	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Navigational landmarks, yeah.	no
342	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Navigational	no
343	transcript	transcript_Bed003	navigational landmarks so	no
344	transcript	transcript_Bed003	cue.	no
345	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
346	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Then -	no
347	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah, that would be	no
348	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Prosody.	no
349	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"Right. So let's see. The variables. Disc- ""admission fee"" is a binary thing, ""time of day"" is like morning, afternoon, night. Is that the deal?"	no
350	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
351	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
352	transcript	transcript_Bed003	That's how we have it currently set up, but it could be,	no
353	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yep.	no
354	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
355	transcript	transcript_Bed003	based upon hour or	no
356	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
357	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Whatever granularity. Uh-huh.	no
358	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
359	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
360	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
361	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah. Normally context will include a huge amount of information, but um, we are just using the particular	no
362	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yep.	no
363	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K. So that's given in their input. Right?	no
364	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right.	no
365	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So - Right, so it's not really all of context. Similarly prosody is not all of prosody but simply	no
366	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
367	transcript	transcript_Bed003	that's very nice, huh?	no
368	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
369	transcript	transcript_Bed003	The - the - So the context is a switch between tourist or non-tourist? Or also unknown?	no
370	transcript	transcript_Bed003	and	no
371	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Or un-	no
372	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah. Unknown, right?	no
373	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
374	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So final dest-	no
375	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So it seems like that would really help you for doing business versus tourist,	no
376	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Which is th- Which one?	no
377	transcript	transcript_Bed003	but	no
378	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"e- I don't know if that question's sort of in general, ""are you -"""	no
379	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I mean the - ar- ar- are do they allow business people to be doing non-business things at the moment?	no
380	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah, it does.	no
381	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K. So then you just have some probabilities over - O_K. - over which which of those it is.	no
382	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Everything is probablistic, and -	no
383	transcript	transcript_Bed003	There's always -	no
384	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
385	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Um, right. So then landmark is -	no
386	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"Oh, sorry. ""Verb used"" is like, right now we only have three values, but in general they would be a probability distribution over all verbs."	no
387	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
388	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Rather, let me rephrase that. It - it can take values	no
389	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
390	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"Um ""nice walls"" is binary, ""closed"" is binary ""final destination"", again - Yeah, all those are binary I guess."	no
391	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"And ""mode"" is one of three things."	no
392	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So, the - the middle layer is also binary? No.	no
393	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Uh.	no
394	transcript	transcript_Bed003	It -	no
395	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah. But all those things without question marks are also binary. Right?	no
396	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Which things?	no
397	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
398	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Nice walls?	no
399	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Wi-	no
400	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"Oh. ""Nice walls"" is uh - something that we extract from our world knowledge."	no
401	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
402	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah, a- Oh yeah. Sorry. It is binary.	no
403	transcript	transcript_Bed003	That's true.	no
404	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah. O_K, I see your point.	no
405	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah. O_K. I - I gotcha.	no
406	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Uh-huh.	no
407	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"Yeah, similarly ""closed"", I guess."	no
408	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So we can either be in a hurry or not, but we cannot be in a medium hurry at the moment?	no
409	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Well, we-	no
410	transcript	transcript_Bed003	To do that we would add another uh - value for that.	no
411	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm. O_K.	no
412	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"And that would require s- updating the probability distribution for ""mode"" as well."	no
413	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
414	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Because it would now have to like uh - take that possibility into account.	no
415	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
416	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Take a conti-	no
417	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
418	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So um, of course this will happen when we think more about the kinds of verbs that are used in each cases but you can imagine that it's verb plus various other things	no
419	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah, yeah.	no
420	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
421	transcript	transcript_Bed003	that are also not in the bottom layer that would - that would help you -	no
422	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Like it's a conjunction of, I don't know, you know, the verb used and some other stuff that - that would	no
423	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right. Other syntactic information you mean? Yeah.	no
424	transcript	transcript_Bed003	well the - the - sort of the landmark is - is sort of the object right? the argument in a sense?	no
425	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Usually. I - I don't know if that's always the case I - I guess haven't looked at the data as much as you guys have. So. Um.	no
426	transcript	transcript_Bed003	that's always warping on something - some entity, and um -	no
427	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
428	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
429	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Uh maybe at this stage we will - we do want to - uh sort of get - uh modifiers	no
430	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Hmm.	no
431	transcript	transcript_Bed003	in there because they may also tell us whether the person is in a hurry or not	no
432	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
433	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah. I want to get to the church quickly, and uh -	no
434	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
435	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah, right.	no
436	transcript	transcript_Bed003	what's the fastest way	no
437	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah, correct.	no
438	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
439	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Um.	no
440	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right. Excellent.	no
441	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Do we have anything else to say about this?	no
442	transcript	transcript_Bed003	We can do a	no
443	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Oh the- Yeah, we could.	no
444	transcript	transcript_Bed003	But the demo doesn't work very well.	no
445	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
446	transcript	transcript_Bed003	No, then it wouldn't be a demo	no
447	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I mean -	no
448	transcript	transcript_Bed003	We can do a demo in the sense that we can um,	no
449	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I was just gonna s-	no
450	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Observe nodes.	no
451	transcript	transcript_Bed003	just ob- observe the fact that this will, in fact do inference. So we can, you know, set some of the uh nodes and then	no
452	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah. Go ahead.	no
453	transcript	transcript_Bed003	try to find the probability of other nodes.	no
454	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
455	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Dat-dat-dah.	no
456	transcript	transcript_Bed003	What should I observe?	no
457	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Just se- set a few of them. You don't have to do the whole thing that we did last time. Just like uh,	no
458	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
459	transcript	transcript_Bed003	maybe the fact that they use a certain verb - Actually forget the verb.	no
460	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
461	transcript	transcript_Bed003	just uh -	no
462	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I don't know, say they discussed the admission fee -	no
463	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
464	transcript	transcript_Bed003	and uh -	no
465	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I love nice walls, O_K?	no
466	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I'm a big fan.	no
467	transcript	transcript_Bed003	and it's night.	no
468	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And the time of day is night?	no
469	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah, no wait. That - that doesn't uh - it's not really consistent. They	no
470	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Alright.	no
471	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And it's night.	no
472	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
473	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Oh whoops.	no
474	transcript	transcript_Bed003	That didn't work.	no
475	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Ach!	no
476	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I'd like to do that again.	no
477	transcript	transcript_Bed003	One thing that bugs me about JavaBayes is you have to click that	no
478	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah. That seems kind of redundant but.	no
479	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
480	transcript	transcript_Bed003	That all you want?	no
481	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yes.	no
482	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
483	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So let's see. I want	no
484	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"""Go"" and, right, ""query""."	no
485	transcript	transcript_Bed003	to query, right?	no
486	transcript	transcript_Bed003	the mode.	no
487	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K, and then on here -	no
488	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So let's see.	no
489	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So that	no
490	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
491	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
492	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So slightly	no
493	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
494	transcript	transcript_Bed003	If it's night time,	no
495	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I guess that	no
496	transcript	transcript_Bed003	The reason I say the	no
497	transcript	transcript_Bed003	observed everything in favor of	no
498	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"taking a tour, and it came up as ""Tango"","	no
499	transcript	transcript_Bed003	right?	no
500	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So.	no
501	transcript	transcript_Bed003	We couldn't -	no
502	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Uh-huh.	no
503	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"we couldn't figure out how to turn it off of ""Tango""."	no
504	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Huh!	no
505	transcript	transcript_Bed003	It loves the Tango.	no
506	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Um.	no
507	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Well, that's obviously just to do with our probabilities. Like,	no
508	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah, yeah.	no
509	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
510	transcript	transcript_Bed003	we totally hand-tuned the probabilities, right. We were like	no
511	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
512	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"""hmm, well if the person does this and this and this, let's say forty percent for this, fifty per-"" Like, you know."	no
513	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So obviously that's gonna happen.	no
514	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right.	no
515	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
516	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah but it - it	no
517	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"Maybe the bias toward ""Tango""ing was yours, then?"	no
518	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah. It's - So we have to like fit the probabilities.	no
519	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Spent my youth practicing the	no
520	transcript	transcript_Bed003	However you know, it -	no
521	transcript	transcript_Bed003	The purpose was not really, at	no
522	transcript	transcript_Bed003	but to get thinking about that hidden middle layer.	no
523	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
524	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And so th-	no
525	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And -	no
526	transcript	transcript_Bed003	We would actually -	no
527	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I guess once we look at the data more we'll get more hidden	no
528	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
529	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
530	transcript	transcript_Bed003	but	no
531	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I'd like to see more.	no
532	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Not because it would	no
533	transcript	transcript_Bed003	cuz it wouldn't.	no
534	transcript	transcript_Bed003	It would actually slow that down tremendously.	no
535	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Um. Well, yeah, I guess.	no
536	transcript	transcript_Bed003	But.	no
537	transcript	transcript_Bed003	No, I think we should have uh - exponentially more	no
538	transcript	transcript_Bed003	middle nodes than features we've extracted.	no
539	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
540	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I'm ju- I'm just jo-	no
541	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"So. Are ""doing business"" versus ""tourist"" - They refer to your current task. Like - like current thing you want to do at this moment."	no
542	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Um. Yeah, well -	no
543	transcript	transcript_Bed003	That's - that's an interesting point. Whether you're -	no
544	transcript	transcript_Bed003	It's whether -	no
545	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And are th-	no
546	transcript	transcript_Bed003	It's not -	no
547	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"I think it's more like ""Are you are tourist? are you in Ham- like Heidelberg for a -"""	no
548	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Oh, so, I thought that was directly given by the context	no
549	transcript	transcript_Bed003	That's a different thing. What if the context, which is not set,	no
550	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"but still they say things like, ""I want to go"	no
551	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Is it -	no

555	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"et cetera."""	no
556	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah. Business on the other hand is, uh, definitely what you're doing.	no
557	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So if you run out of cash as a tourist, and - and - and you need to go to the A_T-	no
558	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So	no
559	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
560	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Oh, I see, you may have a task. wh- you have to go get money and so you are doing business at that stage.	no
561	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mmm.	no
562	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
563	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right.	no
564	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"""How do I get to the bank?"""	no
565	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I see.	no
566	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Hmm.	no
567	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And that'll affect whether you want to enter or you if you - kinda thing.	no
568	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
569	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"So the ""tourists"" node"	no
570	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah,	no
571	transcript	transcript_Bed003	in general what their background is.	no
572	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I don't know, like in d-	no
573	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Uh -	no
574	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Do we	no

576	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Are you assuming that or not? Like is that to be -	no
577	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I mean if that's accurate then that would determine tourist node.	no
578	transcript	transcript_Bed003	If the context were to set one way or another, that like strongly uh	no
579	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
580	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"um, says something about whether - whether or not they're tourists. So what's interesting is when it's not - when it's set to ""unknown""."	no
581	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
582	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
583	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"We- what set the - they set the context to ""unknown""?"	no
584	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
585	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
586	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right now we haven't observed it, so I guess it's sort of averaging over all those three possibilities.	no
587	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
588	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
589	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right.	no
590	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"But yes, you can set it to un- ""unknown""."	no
591	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And if we now do -	no
592	transcript	transcript_Bed003	leave everything else	no
593	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Oops.	no
594	transcript	transcript_Bed003	as is	no
595	transcript	transcript_Bed003	the results should be the same, right?	no
596	transcript	transcript_Bed003	No.	no
597	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Well no, because we -	no
598	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Th- the way we set the probabilities	no
599	transcript	transcript_Bed003	might not have -	no
600	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah, it's - it's an - it's an issue, right? Like -	no
601	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah, it is.	no
602	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So the issue is that um	no
603	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"in belief-nets, it's not common to do what we did of like having, you know, a d- bunch of values and then ""unknown"" as an actual value."	no
604	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
605	transcript	transcript_Bed003	What's common is you just like don't observe the variable, right, and then just marginalizes -	no
606	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
607	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yep.	no
608	transcript	transcript_Bed003	But uh -	no
609	transcript	transcript_Bed003	We didn't do this because we felt that there'd -	no
610	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I guess we were thinking in terms of a switch that actually -	no
611	transcript	transcript_Bed003	We were thi- Yeah,	no
612	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
613	transcript	transcript_Bed003	We were th-	no
614	transcript	transcript_Bed003	But uh - I don't know y- what the right thing is to do for that. I'm not -	no

620	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Uh, well it depends on how many things it's linked to.	no
621	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Let's just say make it really simple. If we create	no
622	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So th- some things can be landmarks in your sense	no
623	transcript	transcript_Bed003	but	no
624	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Good point.	no
625	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah?	no
626	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right.	no
627	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
628	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So	no
629	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"maybe we wanna have ""landmark"""	no

633	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah?	no
634	transcript	transcript_Bed003	uh, a statue or um -	no
635	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"So basically it's addressing a variable that's ""enterable or not""."	no
636	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Also -	no
637	transcript	transcript_Bed003	you know, didn't we have a	no
638	transcript	transcript_Bed003	What?	no
639	transcript	transcript_Bed003	The size of the landmark.	no
640	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Um. Not when we were doing this, but I guess at some point we did.	no
641	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Cuz if it's -	no
642	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
643	transcript	transcript_Bed003	For some reason I had that -	no
644	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K, that was a thought that I had at one point but then went away.	no
645	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So you want to have a - a node for like whether or not it can be entered?	no
646	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Well,	no
647	transcript	transcript_Bed003	for example, if we include that, yeah?	no
648	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
649	transcript	transcript_Bed003	um, accessibility or something, yeah?	no
650	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Hmm.	no
651	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"""Is it - Can it be entered?"""	no
652	transcript	transcript_Bed003	then of course, this is	no
653	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
654	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And then um, there's also the question whether it	no
655	transcript	transcript_Bed003	In the sense that,	no
656	transcript	transcript_Bed003	you know, if it's	no
657	transcript	transcript_Bed003	you know, it's	no
658	transcript	transcript_Bed003	but you	no
659	transcript	transcript_Bed003	You know? You're not allowed to.	no
660	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
661	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Unless you are, whatever, his - his divorce lawyer or something. Yeah?	no
662	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
663	transcript	transcript_Bed003	and um -	no
664	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Way-	no
665	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And these are very observable sort of from the - from the ontology sort of things.	no
666	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Does it actually help to distinguish between those two cases though?	no
667	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Whether it's	no
668	transcript	transcript_Bed003	practically speaking enterable, or	no
669	transcript	transcript_Bed003	actually physically enterable	no
670	transcript	transcript_Bed003	It seems like it would for uh, uh	no
671	transcript	transcript_Bed003	y- y-	no
672	transcript	transcript_Bed003	If -	no
673	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Well I can see why -	no
674	transcript	transcript_Bed003	If you're running an errand you maybe more likely to be able to enter places that are usually not	no
675	transcript	transcript_Bed003	al- w- you're not usually - not allowed to uh- m-	no
676	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Let's get this uh b- clearer.	no
677	transcript	transcript_Bed003	S- so it's matrix between	no
678	transcript	transcript_Bed003	if it's not enterable, period.	no
679	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Whether it's a - Whether it's a public building,	no
680	transcript	transcript_Bed003	and whether it's - actually has a door.	no
681	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah, exactly.	no
682	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
683	transcript	transcript_Bed003	This is sort of uh-	no
684	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
685	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So Tom Cruise's house is	no
686	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right.	no
687	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
688	transcript	transcript_Bed003	But the thing is -	no
689	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K,	no
690	transcript	transcript_Bed003	sh- explain to me why it's necessary	no
691	transcript	transcript_Bed003	to distinguish between	no
692	transcript	transcript_Bed003	whether something	no
693	transcript	transcript_Bed003	has a door	no
694	transcript	transcript_Bed003	and is	no
695	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Or, if something -	no
696	transcript	transcript_Bed003	It seems like it's equivalent to say that it doesn't have a door a-	no
697	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
698	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"Or ""not public"" and ""not a door"" are equivalent things,"	no
699	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
700	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right.	no
701	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
702	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So we would have -	no
703	transcript	transcript_Bed003	What does it mean, then, that we have to -	no
704	transcript	transcript_Bed003	we have an object type statue. That really is an object type.	no
705	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right.	no
706	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So there is - there's gonna be a bunch of statues.	no
707	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And then we have,	no
708	transcript	transcript_Bed003	for example, an object type,	no
709	transcript	transcript_Bed003	hmm, that's a hotel. How about hotels?	no
710	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
711	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So,	no
712	transcript	transcript_Bed003	the most famous building in Heidelberg is actually a hotel.	no
713	transcript	transcript_Bed003	It's the hotel	no
714	transcript	transcript_Bed003	which is the only Renaissance building in Heidelberg	no
715	transcript	transcript_Bed003	that was left after	no
716	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Hmm.	no
717	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Does it have nice walls?	no
718	transcript	transcript_Bed003	It has	no
719	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Excellent.	no
720	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Um-	no
721	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And lots of detail, c- and carvings, engravings and so forth, so.	no
722	transcript	transcript_Bed003	But, um, it's still an unlikely candidate for the Tango	no
723	transcript	transcript_Bed003	But.	no
724	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Um. So - s-	no
725	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So if	no
726	transcript	transcript_Bed003	you are a d-	no
727	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Well it's very tricky.	no
728	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So I guess your question is - so far I have no really arg-	no
729	transcript	transcript_Bed003	no real argument why to differentiate between statues as -	no
730	transcript	transcript_Bed003	statues and houses of celebrities,	no
731	transcript	transcript_Bed003	from that point of view.	no
732	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Huh.	no
733	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K. Let - Let's do a -	no
734	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"Can we add, just so I can see how it's done, uh, a ""has door"""	no
735	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
736	transcript	transcript_Bed003	What would it, uh, connect to? Like, what would, uh, it affect?	no
737	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Um, I think, um, it might affect -	no
738	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Oh actually it's - it -	no
739	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Oh it's - it affects th-	no
740	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"The ""doing business"" is certainly not."	no
741	transcript	transcript_Bed003	You could affect -	no
742	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"Theoretically you could affect ""doing business"" with ""has door""."	no
743	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah. O_K.	no
744	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Hmm.	no
745	transcript	transcript_Bed003	It should, um,	no
746	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right.	no
747	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Let's see.	no
748	transcript	transcript_Bed003	inhibit that, right?	no
749	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah, I don't know if JavaBayes is nice about that. It might be that if you add a new thing pointing to a variable, you just like -	no
750	transcript	transcript_Bed003	it just overwrites everything.	no
751	transcript	transcript_Bed003	But	no
752	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Well,	no
753	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
754	transcript	transcript_Bed003	We can rel- open it up again.	no
755	transcript	transcript_Bed003	It's true.	no
756	transcript	transcript_Bed003	The	no
757	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I think you could just add it. I mean, I have before O_K. Whew!	no
758	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Well that's fine, but we have to see the function now. Has it become all point fives or not?	no
759	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Oh, right.	no
760	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Let's see. So this is	no
761	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"""has door"""	no
762	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Uh, true, false. That's acceptable.	no
763	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And I want to edit the function going	no
764	transcript	transcript_Bed003	No. This is fine, this business.	no
765	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Oh no.	no
766	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right. It was	no
767	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yep.	no
768	transcript	transcript_Bed003	What would be nice if it - is if it just like kept the old function for either value but.	no
769	transcript	transcript_Bed003	This -	no
770	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Nope.	no
771	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Oh.	no
772	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Didn't	no
773	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Oh wait, it might be -	no
774	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Did we w-	no
775	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yes, that's not good.	no
776	transcript	transcript_Bed003	That's	no
777	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K, so just dis- dismiss everything.	no
778	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Close it and - and load up the old state so	no
779	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Let's see.	no
780	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Oops.	no
781	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Hmm.	no
782	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Maybe you can	no
783	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Ha-	no
784	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So have you used JavaBayes a lot?	no
785	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yes. Really	no
786	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I haven't used it a lot and I haven't used it in the last you know many months so	no
787	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
788	transcript	transcript_Bed003	um, uh, we can ask someone.	no
789	transcript	transcript_Bed003	It might be worth uh - asking around. Like,	no
790	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Um.	no
791	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
792	transcript	transcript_Bed003	we looked at sort of uh - a page that had like a bunch of -	no
793	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Srini -	no
794	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K. Yeah, S- I guess he'd be the person.	no
795	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Srini's the one to ask I would say. Um. He might know.	no
796	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
797	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Cuz - Yeah.	no
798	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And.	no
799	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I mean in a way this is a lot of good features in Java it's cra- has a GUI and it's uh -	no
800	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
801	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I guess those are the main two things. It does learning, it has -	no
802	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm. Yeah.	no
803	transcript	transcript_Bed003	No it doesn't, actually.	no
804	transcript	transcript_Bed003	What?	no
805	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I didn't think it did learning.	no
806	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
807	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Maybe it did a	no
808	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Oh right. Maybe you're right. O_K.	no
809	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right.	no
810	transcript	transcript_Bed003	But uh - it's free.	no
811	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Which is w- quite positive, yeah.	no
812	transcript	transcript_Bed003	But uh, yeah.	no
813	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Maybe another thing that uh -	no
814	transcript	transcript_Bed003	But I mean its interface is not the greatest. So.	no
815	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
816	transcript	transcript_Bed003	But actually it	no
817	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yep.	no
818	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Command line.	no
819	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Huh.	no
820	transcript	transcript_Bed003	What is the c- code? Can w- can we see that?	no
821	transcript	transcript_Bed003	How do you write the code or do you actually never have to write any code there?	no
822	transcript	transcript_Bed003	The c-	no
823	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah. There is actually a text file that you can edit.	no
824	transcript	transcript_Bed003	But it's - You don't have to do that.	no
825	transcript	transcript_Bed003	There's like an X_M_L format for	no
826	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Is it X_M_L?	no
827	transcript	transcript_Bed003	The- there	no
828	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Oh, I see. No this doesn't use it.	no
829	transcript	transcript_Bed003	But it -	no
830	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I didn't think it did.	no
831	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah, the - the -	no
832	transcript	transcript_Bed003	You can look at the text file.	no
833	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
834	transcript	transcript_Bed003	But do you have it here?	no
835	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Well, maybe you don't.	no
836	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Uh, yes I	no
837	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Oh yes, of course. Like, there's the -	no
838	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Oh man, I didn't n-	no
839	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Is there an ampersand in DOS?	no
840	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Nope. Just s- l- start up a new D_O_S.	no
841	transcript	transcript_Bed003	We- That's alright. I can probably double cli- click on it.	no
842	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Or - Yeah, right.	no
843	transcript	transcript_Bed003	n- uh -	no
844	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Let's see.	no
845	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yep.	no
846	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Let's see, come on.	no
847	transcript	transcript_Bed003	It'll ask you what you - what it wants -	no
848	transcript	transcript_Bed003	what you want to open it with and see	no
849	transcript	transcript_Bed003	what	no
850	transcript	transcript_Bed003	One of these days, it should open this,	no
851	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Go - Right mouse.	no
852	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Open with.	no
853	transcript	transcript_Bed003	That's - Oh!	no
854	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Oh	no
855	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Maybe it was just -	no
856	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Oh! W-	no
857	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Oh.	no
858	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Ah, it was dead.	no
859	transcript	transcript_Bed003	To the world.	no
860	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
861	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Through the old Notepad. That's my favorite editor.	no
862	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I like -	no
863	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Wordpad?	no
864	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I like Word Pad because it has the uh -	no
865	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I -	no
866	transcript	transcript_Bed003	the returns, the carriage returns on some of them.	no
867	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm. O_K.	no
868	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"You know how they get ""auto-fills"" I guess, or whatever you call it."	no
869	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mmm-hmm.	no
870	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Anyway, there it is.	no
871	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So this is sort of LISP-y?	no
872	transcript	transcript_Bed003	No.	no
873	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Uh, Yeah.	no
874	transcript	transcript_Bed003	It just basically looks like it just specifies a bunch of STRUCTs.	no
875	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
876	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
877	transcript	transcript_Bed003	That's how actual probability tables are specified. As, like, lists of numbers.	no
878	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
879	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
880	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
881	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So theoretically you could edit that.	no
882	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
883	transcript	transcript_Bed003	But	no
884	transcript	transcript_Bed003	It just that - it's -	no
885	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah the ordering isn't very clear on -	no
886	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right.	no
887	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So you'd have to like figure out -	no
888	transcript	transcript_Bed003	The layout	no
889	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Like you have to go and - Yeah.	no
890	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Well I -	no
891	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Actually we could	no
892	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
893	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I think so.	no
894	transcript	transcript_Bed003	You could.	no
895	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah you could.	no
896	transcript	transcript_Bed003	it's not -	no
897	transcript	transcript_Bed003	We were doing it -	no
898	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah we can maybe write an interface th- for uh entering probability distributions easily,	no
899	transcript	transcript_Bed003	That might	no
900	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And that might do.	no
901	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah. I actually seem to recall Srini complaining about something to do with Entering probability so this is probably	no
902	transcript	transcript_Bed003	The other thing is it is in Java	no
903	transcript	transcript_Bed003	We could	no
904	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
905	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Do you have the true source files or just the class?	no
906	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I don't know if he actually -	no
907	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah. Uh, yeah. we do	no
908	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Does he -	no
909	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"I - I saw directory called ""source"", or -"	no
910	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Oh.	no
911	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
912	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I didn't e-	no
913	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
914	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Up one.	no
915	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
916	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"Ah yes, good. ""Source""."	no
917	transcript	transcript_Bed003	That's - that's quite nice.	no
918	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I don't know if it actually manipulate the source, though. That might be a bit complicated. I think it might - it might be simpler to just	no
919	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
920	transcript	transcript_Bed003	It's, like, friendly, it allows you enter things well.	no
921	transcript	transcript_Bed003	The d-	no
922	transcript	transcript_Bed003	the data tables.	no
923	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
924	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right.	no
925	transcript	transcript_Bed003	But if th- if there is an X_M_L	no
926	transcript	transcript_Bed003	file that - or format that it can also read -	no
927	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I mean it just reads this, right? When it starts.	no
928	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
929	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah I know there is an - I was looking on the we- web page and he's updated it for an X_M_L version of I guess Bayes-nets. There's a Bayes-net spec for - in X_M_L.	no
930	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
931	transcript	transcript_Bed003	He's - Like this guy has? The JavaBayes guy? So - but, e- he doesn't use it. So in what sense has he updated it?	no
932	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
933	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Well th- you can either - you ca- or you can read both.	no
934	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Oh. I see.	no
935	transcript	transcript_Bed003	To my understanding.	no
936	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K. That would be awesome.	no
937	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Oh.	no
938	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Because uh -	no
939	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Well at least the - uh -	no
940	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I could have misread the web page, I have a habit of doing that, but.	no
941	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
942	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K, wonderful.	no
943	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So you got more slides?	no
944	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Do I have more slides?	no
945	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"Um yes, one more. ""Future Work"". I think every presentation have a should have a ""Future Work"" slide."	no
946	transcript	transcript_Bed003	But uh it's basically - we already talked about all this stuff, so.	no
947	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Um. The additional thing is I guess learning the probabilities,	no
948	transcript	transcript_Bed003	E- That's maybe, I don't know -	no
949	transcript	transcript_Bed003	If - Does -	no
950	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Uh that's future	no
951	transcript	transcript_Bed003	That's - Yeah.	no
952	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right.	no
953	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
954	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"And of course if you have a presentation that doesn't - have something that doesn't work at all, then you have ""What I learned"","	no
955	transcript	transcript_Bed003	as a slide.	no

958	transcript	transcript_Bed003	My first approach failed.	no
959	transcript	transcript_Bed003	What I learned. O_K, so I think that uh- our presentation's finished.	no
960	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Good.	no
961	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I know what I like about these meetings is one person will nod, and then the next person will nod, and then it just goes all the way around the room.	no
962	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So the uh -	no
963	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I missed my turn.	no
964	transcript	transcript_Bed003	No I - Earlier I went	no
965	transcript	transcript_Bed003	It's like yawning.	no
966	transcript	transcript_Bed003	It's like yawning.	no
967	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And this announcement was in stereo.	no
968	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Ha.	no
969	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
970	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So this means um -	no
971	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Should I pull up the	no
972	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah. Could you put the - the um, net up again? Thanks.	no
973	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And actually I was - cuz I got a wireless mike on.	no
974	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"So a more general thing than ""discussed admission fee"" um, could be - I - I'm just wondering whether the context, the background context of the discourse"	no
975	transcript	transcript_Bed003	might be -	no
976	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I don't know, if there's a way to	no
977	transcript	transcript_Bed003	um, there might be other cues that, say, um,	no
978	transcript	transcript_Bed003	in the last few utterances	no
979	transcript	transcript_Bed003	there has been something that has strongly associated with say one of the particular modes	no

981	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
982	transcript	transcript_Bed003	uh, and - and into that node would be various - various things that - that could	no
983	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I think we -	no
984	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I think a - a sort of general strategy here -	no
985	transcript	transcript_Bed003	You know, this is - this is excellent because -	no
986	transcript	transcript_Bed003	um it gets you thinking along these terms - is that maybe	no
987	transcript	transcript_Bed003	we ob- we could observe a couple of	no
988	transcript	transcript_Bed003	um	no
989	transcript	transcript_Bed003	discourse phenomena	no
990	transcript	transcript_Bed003	such as	no
991	transcript	transcript_Bed003	the admission fee,	no
992	transcript	transcript_Bed003	something else and something else, that happened in the discourse before.	no
993	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
994	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right.	no
995	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And um -	no
996	transcript	transcript_Bed003	let's make those four.	no
997	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And maybe there are two um -	no
998	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So maybe this could be sort of a separate	no
999	transcript	transcript_Bed003	region of the net,	no
1000	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Maybe this, you know, has some	no
1001	transcript	transcript_Bed003	funky thing that di- if this and this may influence	no
1002	transcript	transcript_Bed003	these hidden nodes of the discourse which is maybe something	no
1003	transcript	transcript_Bed003	that is uh,	no
1004	transcript	transcript_Bed003	a more general version of the actual	no
1005	transcript	transcript_Bed003	towards -	no

1012	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"So """	no
1013	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
1014	transcript	transcript_Bed003	uh- uh- d-	no
1015	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Sure. Yeah.	no
1016	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah?	no
1017	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I mean it sort of get into plan recognition kinds of things in the discourse. I mean that's like the bigger um,	no
1018	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Exactly. Yeah? And then maybe there are some	no
1019	transcript	transcript_Bed003	version of it.	no
1020	transcript	transcript_Bed003	discourse acts if they happened before,	no
1021	transcript	transcript_Bed003	um it's more for um	no
1022	transcript	transcript_Bed003	a cue that the person actually wants to get somewhere else and that you are in a - in a - in a route	no

1036	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah, exactly. And this is just - then just one.	no
1037	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So e- because at the end the more we um - add,	no
1038	transcript	transcript_Bed003	you know, the more spider-web-ish it's going to become in the middle and the more of hand editing. It's going to get very ugly.	no
1039	transcript	transcript_Bed003	But with	no
1040	transcript	transcript_Bed003	um or the general hidden layer.	no
1041	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Sure.	no
1042	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And the same we will be able to do for	no
1043	transcript	transcript_Bed003	syntactic information, the verbs used, the object types used, modifiers.	no
1044	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And maybe there's a hidden layer	no
1045	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yep.	no
1046	transcript	transcript_Bed003	for that. And so forth and so forth. Then we have context.	no
1047	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah. So essentially a lot of those nodes can be expanded into little Bayes-nets of their own.	no
1048	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yep.	no
1049	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
1050	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Precisely.	no
1051	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So.	yes
1052	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So.	no
1053	transcript	transcript_Bed003	One thing that's kind of been bugging me	no
1054	transcript	transcript_Bed003	when I - more I look at this is that the -	no
1055	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I guess, the fact that the -	no
1056	transcript	transcript_Bed003	there's a complete separation between the	no
1057	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
1058	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I mean, it makes it cleaner, but then uh - I mean.	no
1059	transcript	transcript_Bed003	That's true.	no
1060	transcript	transcript_Bed003	For instance if	no
1061	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"the discourse does - well for instance, the ""discourse admission fee"""	no
1062	transcript	transcript_Bed003	What do you mean by that?	no
1063	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Uh-huh.	no
1064	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"seems like it should point directly to the - or increase the probability of ""enter"	no
1065	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah. Or we could like add more, uh,	no

1067	transcript	transcript_Bed003	do they want to enter it, which is affected by admission fee	no
1068	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
1069	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So it's like -	no
1070	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right.	no
1071	transcript	transcript_Bed003	There are - Those are the two options. Either like make an arrow directly or put a new node.	no
1072	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Hmm.	no
1073	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah, that makes sense.	no
1074	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
1075	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And if it - if you do it -	no
1076	transcript	transcript_Bed003	If you could connect it too hard you may get such phenomenon that - like	no
1077	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"""So how much has it cost to enter?"" and the answer is two hundred fifty dollars,"	no
1078	transcript	transcript_Bed003	and then the persons says	no
1079	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"um ""Yeah I want to see it."""	no
1080	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah?	no
1081	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"meaning ""It's way out of my budget"" um -"	no
1082	transcript	transcript_Bed003	There are places in Germany where it costs two hundred fifty dollars to enter?	no
1083	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Um, nothing comes to mind.	no
1084	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Without thinking too hard. Um, maybe, yeah of course, um opera premiers.	no
1085	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Really?	no
1086	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So you know.	no
1087	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Hmm.	no
1088	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Or - or any good old Pink Floyd concert.	no
1089	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I see.	no
1090	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"If you want to see ""The Magic Flute"" or something."	no
1091	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
1092	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Or maybe um, a famous restaurant. or, I don't know. There are various things that you might w- not want to eat a	no
1093	transcript	transcript_Bed003	The Spagos of Heidelberg.	no
1094	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I think that the h- I mean nothing beats the - the admission charge prices in Japan.	no
1095	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So there, two hundred dollars is - is moderate for getting into a discotheque.	no
1096	transcript	transcript_Bed003	You know.	no
1097	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Really.	no
1098	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Then again,	no
1099	transcript	transcript_Bed003	everything else is free then once you're ins-	no
1100	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Food and drink and so forth. So.	no
1101	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I mean.	no
1102	transcript	transcript_Bed003	But i- you know, i- we	no
1103	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Somebody	no
1104	transcript	transcript_Bed003	is s-	no
1105	transcript	transcript_Bed003	if we -	no
1106	transcript	transcript_Bed003	still,	no
1107	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Hmm.	no
1108	transcript	transcript_Bed003	based on that result is	no
1109	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Oh yeah, I think I see.	no
1110	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"So the discourse refers to ""admission fee"" but it just turns out that"	no
1111	transcript	transcript_Bed003	they change their mind in the middle of the discourse.	no
1112	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah. you have to have some notion of not just -	no
1113	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I mean there's a -	no
1114	transcript	transcript_Bed003	there's change across several turns of discourse so	no
1115	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right.	no
1116	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
1117	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I don't know how - if any of this was discussed - but how i- if it all this is going to interact with	no
1118	transcript	transcript_Bed003	whatever general	no
1119	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
1120	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
1121	transcript	transcript_Bed003	What sort of discourse	no
1122	transcript	transcript_Bed003	How much is built into SmartKom and -	no
1123	transcript	transcript_Bed003	It works like this. The uh,	no
1124	transcript	transcript_Bed003	um -	no
1125	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I mean.	no
1126	transcript	transcript_Bed003	The first thing we get is that	no
1127	transcript	transcript_Bed003	already the	no
1128	transcript	transcript_Bed003	They	no
1129	transcript	transcript_Bed003	simply by parsing it.	no
1130	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And this um - m-	no
1131	transcript	transcript_Bed003	won't differentiate between	no
1132	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"but at least it'll tell us ""O_K here we have something that -"	no
1133	transcript	transcript_Bed003	somebody that wants to go	no
1134	transcript	transcript_Bed003	what kind of going there is - is -	no
1135	transcript	transcript_Bed003	and um, if the discourse takes a couple of turns before everything - all the information is needed,	no
1136	transcript	transcript_Bed003	what happens is you know the parser parses it and then it's handed on to the discourse history which is,	no
1137	transcript	transcript_Bed003	um o- one of the most elaborate -	no
1138	transcript	transcript_Bed003	elaborate modules. It's - it's actually the - the whole memory of the entire system,	no
1139	transcript	transcript_Bed003	that knows what - wh- who said what, which was - what was presented. It helps an- an- anaphora resolution and it -	no
1140	transcript	transcript_Bed003	and it fills in all the structures that are omitted,	no
1141	transcript	transcript_Bed003	so,	no
1142	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"because you say ""O_K,"	no
1143	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"""Oh, how - how much is it?"""	no
1144	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"and um ""yeah I would like uh - um -"	no
1145	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"to g- let's do it"" and so forth."	no
1146	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So even without an a- ana-	no
1147	transcript	transcript_Bed003	anaphora somebody has to make sure that	no
1148	transcript	transcript_Bed003	information we had	no
1149	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
1150	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Because not every module keeps a memory of everything that happened.	no
1151	transcript	transcript_Bed003	so	no
1152	transcript	transcript_Bed003	um person is not actually	no
1153	transcript	transcript_Bed003	so as in	no
1154	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"""No I really"	no
1155	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"I'd rather stay home and watch T_V"""	no
1156	transcript	transcript_Bed003	um -	no
1157	transcript	transcript_Bed003	What movie was selected in what cinema in what town is - is going to be sort of	no
1158	transcript	transcript_Bed003	added into the disc- into the representations	no
1159	transcript	transcript_Bed003	every di- at each dialogue step, by the discourse model -	no
1160	transcript	transcript_Bed003	discourse	no
1161	transcript	transcript_Bed003	and, um, it does some help in the anaphora resolution and it also helps in coordinating	no
1162	transcript	transcript_Bed003	the gesture screen issues. So a person pointing to something on the screen, you know,	no
1163	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Hmm.	no
1164	transcript	transcript_Bed003	the discourse model actually stores what was presented at what location on the s- on the screen so it's a - it's a rather huge	no
1165	transcript	transcript_Bed003	huge thing but um -	no
1166	transcript	transcript_Bed003	um -	no
1167	transcript	transcript_Bed003	we can	no
1168	transcript	transcript_Bed003	sort of - It has a very clear interface. We can query it	no
1169	transcript	transcript_Bed003	whether admission fees were discussed in the last turn and - and the turn before that or you know	no
1170	transcript	transcript_Bed003	how	no
1171	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
1172	transcript	transcript_Bed003	um - which is a question. How deep	no
1173	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Um - but	no
1174	transcript	transcript_Bed003	we should	no
1175	transcript	transcript_Bed003	try to keep in mind that,	no
1176	transcript	transcript_Bed003	you know, we're doing this sort of for research, so we - we should find a limit	no
1177	transcript	transcript_Bed003	that's reasonable and not go,	no
1178	transcript	transcript_Bed003	you know,	no
1179	transcript	transcript_Bed003	all the way back to Adam and Eve.	no
1180	transcript	transcript_Bed003	You know, did that person ever discuss admissions fee -	no
1181	transcript	transcript_Bed003	fees in his entire life?	no
1182	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And the dialogues are pretty - pretty you know	no
1183	transcript	transcript_Bed003	concise and - Anyway.	no
1184	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So one thing that might be helpful which is implicit in the	no
1185	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"use of ""admission fee discussion"" as a cue for entry,"	no
1186	transcript	transcript_Bed003	is thinking about the plans that various people might have.	no
1187	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Like all the different	no
1188	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K. This person is um,	no
1189	transcript	transcript_Bed003	finding out information about this thing in order to go	no
1190	transcript	transcript_Bed003	in as a tourist or finding out how to get to this place	no
1191	transcript	transcript_Bed003	in order to do business.	no
1192	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Um, because then	no
1193	transcript	transcript_Bed003	anything that's a cue for one of the steps	no
1194	transcript	transcript_Bed003	would be slight evidence for that overall plan.	no
1195	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Um, I don't know. They're - in - in non- in sort of more traditional A_I kinds of plan recognition things you sort of have	no
1196	transcript	transcript_Bed003	you know, some idea at each turn of agent doing something,	no
1197	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"""O_K, wha- what plans is this a - consistent with?"""	no
1198	transcript	transcript_Bed003	and then get s- some more information and then you see	no
1199	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"""here's a sequence that this sort of roughly fits into""."	no
1200	transcript	transcript_Bed003	It - it might be useful here too. I - I don't know how you know you'd have to	no
1201	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
1202	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I mean the -	no
1203	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Hmm.	no
1204	transcript	transcript_Bed003	figure out what knowl- what knowledge representation would work for that.	no
1205	transcript	transcript_Bed003	u- u-	no
1206	transcript	transcript_Bed003	It's in the - these - these - these plan schemas.	no
1207	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I mean there are some - some of them are	no
1208	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"""What do you need - need to buy a ticket?"" You know?"	no
1209	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.	no
1210	transcript	transcript_Bed003	and it - it's fifty steps,	no
1211	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
1212	transcript	transcript_Bed003	just for buying a ticket	no
1213	transcript	transcript_Bed003	you know, and - and maybe that's helpful to look at it - to look at those.	no
1214	transcript	transcript_Bed003	It's amazing what human beings can do. W- when we talked uh we had the example, you know, of you being uh - a s- a person on a ticket counter working at railway station and somebody r-	no
1215	transcript	transcript_Bed003	runs up to you with a suitcase in his hands, says	no
1216	transcript	transcript_Bed003	New York	no
1217	transcript	transcript_Bed003	and you say	no
1218	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Track seven, huh?	no
1219	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And it's because you know that that person actually is following,	no
1220	transcript	transcript_Bed003	you know -	no
1221	transcript	transcript_Bed003	You execute a whole plan of going through a hundred and fifty steps,	no
1222	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"you know, without any information other than ""New York"", huh?"	no
1223	transcript	transcript_Bed003	inferring everything from the context. So,	no
1224	transcript	transcript_Bed003	works.	no
1225	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Um, even though there is probably no train from here to New York,	no
1226	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mmm. Not direct.	no
1227	transcript	transcript_Bed003	You'd uh probably have to transfer in Chicago.	no
1228	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
1229	transcript	transcript_Bed003	But uh - it's possible.	no
1230	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Um, no you probably have to transfer also somewhere else.	no
1231	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right?	no
1232	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Is that t- San Francisco, Chicago?	no
1233	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I think -	no
1234	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Is that possible?	no
1235	transcript	transcript_Bed003	One time I saw a report on trains,	no
1236	transcript	transcript_Bed003	and I think there is a l-	no
1237	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I don't know if - I thought there was a line that went from	no
1238	transcript	transcript_Bed003	somewhere, maybe it was Sacramento to Chicago, but there was like a California to Chicago line of some sort.	no
1239	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
1240	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Hmm.	no
1241	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I could be wrong though. It was a while ago.	no
1242	transcript	transcript_Bed003	The Transcontinental Railroad, doesn't that ring a bell?	no
1243	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I think it has to exist somewhere.	no
1244	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah but I don't know if it's still -	no
1245	transcript	transcript_Bed003	They might have blown it up.	no
1246	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Well it never went all the way, right? I mean you always had to change trains at Omaha, right?	no
1247	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Well	no
1248	transcript	transcript_Bed003	One track ended there and the other one started at - five meters away from that	no
1249	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm. Yeah.	no
1250	transcript	transcript_Bed003	and	no
1251	transcript	transcript_Bed003	sort of -	no
1252	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Well.	no
1253	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Has anybody ever	no
1254	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I have. But not transcontinentally.	no
1255	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
1256	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I'm frightened by Amtrak myself.	no
1257	transcript	transcript_Bed003	What? Why?	no
1258	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I just -	no
1259	transcript	transcript_Bed003	They seem to have a lot of accidents on the Amtrak.	no
1260	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Really?	no
1261	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Their reputation is very bad. huh?	no
1262	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
1263	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
1264	transcript	transcript_Bed003	It's not maybe reality.	no
1265	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Like German trains are really great so.	no
1266	transcript	transcript_Bed003	But -	no
1267	transcript	transcript_Bed003	you know, I don't know whether it's -	no
1268	transcript	transcript_Bed003	which ones are safer,	no
1269	transcript	transcript_Bed003	you know, statistically.	no
1270	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Um, but they're faster.	no
1271	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
1272	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And there's much more of them. Yeah, they're	no
1273	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah, it's	no
1274	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I used - um Amtrak quite a bit on the east coast	no
1275	transcript	transcript_Bed003	and I was surprised.	no
1276	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
1277	transcript	transcript_Bed003	It was actually O_K.	no
1278	transcript	transcript_Bed003	You know, on Boston New York, New York Rhode Island, whatever,	no
1279	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
1280	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
1281	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I've done that kind of thing.	no
1282	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
1283	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
1284	transcript	transcript_Bed003	But -	no
1285	transcript	transcript_Bed003	That's	no
1286	transcript	transcript_Bed003	This	no
1287	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"I - I want to see what it does with uh ""landmark-iness""."	no
1288	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Hmm?	no
1289	transcript	transcript_Bed003	That's -	no
1290	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
1291	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Let's all say it a few more times.	no
1292	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So.	no
1293	transcript	transcript_Bed003	It'd help it figure it out.	no
1294	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right.	no
1295	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
1296	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So by the way tha- that structure	no
1297	transcript	transcript_Bed003	that Robert drew on the board was like more um,	no
1298	transcript	transcript_Bed003	cue-type-based, right, here's like we're gonna	no
1299	transcript	transcript_Bed003	and then	no
1300	transcript	transcript_Bed003	some of the things we're talking about here are more -	no
1301	transcript	transcript_Bed003	you know, we mentioned maybe	no
1302	transcript	transcript_Bed003	if they talk about	no
1303	transcript	transcript_Bed003	um, I don't know, entering or som- you know like they might be more task-based.	no
1304	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Hmm.	no
1305	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So I - I don't know if there - There's obviously some -	no
1306	transcript	transcript_Bed003	m- more than one way of organizing	no
1307	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I think that um -	no
1308	transcript	transcript_Bed003	What you guys did is really nicely sketching out different tasks,	no
1309	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
1310	transcript	transcript_Bed003	and maybe some of their conditions.	no
1311	transcript	transcript_Bed003	One task is more likely you're in a hurry when you do that kind of s-	no
1312	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
1313	transcript	transcript_Bed003	doing business, and - and less in a hurry when uh - you're a tourist	no
1314	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Um -	no
1315	transcript	transcript_Bed003	maybe what - what - what happened -	no
1316	transcript	transcript_Bed003	what	no
1317	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
1318	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
1319	transcript	transcript_Bed003	and then we'll get these	no
1320	transcript	transcript_Bed003	That feed into those?	no
1321	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
1322	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Nah?	no
1323	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Might be - might be a nice dichotomy of - of the world.	no
1324	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So,	no
1325	transcript	transcript_Bed003	um	no
1326	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I suggest w- to - for -	no
1327	transcript	transcript_Bed003	to proceed with this in - in the sense that	no
1328	transcript	transcript_Bed003	maybe throughout this week	no
1329	transcript	transcript_Bed003	the three of us will - will talk some more about maybe segmenting off different regions,	no
1330	transcript	transcript_Bed003	and we make up some -	no
1331	transcript	transcript_Bed003	a-	no
1332	transcript	transcript_Bed003	observable	no
1333	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"""nodes"" - is that what th-"	no
1334	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Refined y- re- just refine the -	no
1335	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
1336	transcript	transcript_Bed003	What's the technical term?	no
1337	transcript	transcript_Bed003	For which?	no
1338	transcript	transcript_Bed003	For the uh - nodes that are observable?	no
1339	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"The ""outer layer""?"	no
1340	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Just observable nodes, evidence nodes?	no
1341	transcript	transcript_Bed003	The features, I don't know, whatever you -	no
1342	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Feature ma- make up some features for those -	no
1343	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
1344	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Identify	no
1345	transcript	transcript_Bed003	and uh, uh - and uh -	no
1346	transcript	transcript_Bed003	middle layer for those.	no
1347	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And then these should then connect somehow to the more plan-based deep space	no
1348	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
1349	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Basically just refine	no
1350	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yep.	no
1351	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah, this is totally like - The probabilities and all are completely ad-hoc. We need to look at all of them.	no
1352	transcript	transcript_Bed003	more general nodes.	no
1353	transcript	transcript_Bed003	The- they - they	no
1354	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I mean but, they're even like	no
1355	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I mean like, close to the end we were like, uh,	no
1356	transcript	transcript_Bed003	you know we were like uh	no
1357	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right? Cuz if it's like, uh - If it's four things coming in, right?	no
1358	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And, say, some of them have like three possibilities and all that. So you're thinking like -	no
1359	transcript	transcript_Bed003	like a hundred and forty four or something	no
1360	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And -	no
1361	transcript	transcript_Bed003	possible things - numbers to enter, right? So.	no
1362	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Some of them are completely absurd too, like -	no
1363	transcript	transcript_Bed003	That's uh -	no
1364	transcript	transcript_Bed003	they want to enter, but it's closed, it's night time, you know there are tourists and all this weird stuff happens at the line up and you're like -	no
1365	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Well -	no
1366	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah, the only like possible interpretation is that they are like -	no
1367	transcript	transcript_Bed003	confused.	no
1368	transcript	transcript_Bed003	come here just to rob the museum or	no
1369	transcript	transcript_Bed003	something to that effect.	no
1370	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah, another thing to do, um, is also to, um - I guess to ask around people about other Bayes-net packages.	no
1371	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Is Srini gonna be	no
1372	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Maybe.	no
1373	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Wait -	no
1374	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Quite possibly. Oh, oh, sorry. Sorry, Wednesday, yeah.	no
1375	transcript	transcript_Bed003	The day	no
1376	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Day after tomorrow. Yeah.	no
1377	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Maybe we can ask him about it.	no
1378	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Who's talking on Wednesday?	no
1379	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mmm.	no
1380	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I haven't -	no
1381	transcript	transcript_Bed003	J- Jerry never sent out a - sent out an email,	no
1382	transcript	transcript_Bed003	No. But he mentioned at the last meeting that someone was going to be talking, I forget who. Uh.	no
1383	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Oh, isn't Ben?	no
1384	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Ben? I think it's Ben actually, yeah,	no
1385	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Ben,	no
1386	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Ah!	no
1387	transcript	transcript_Bed003	um,	no
1388	transcript	transcript_Bed003	giving his job talk I think.	no
1389	transcript	transcript_Bed003	um,	no
1390	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Sorry.	no
1391	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
1392	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Oh.	no
1393	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
1394	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So the uh -	no
1395	transcript	transcript_Bed003	That will be one - one thing we could do.	no
1396	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I actually uh, have - Um, also we can uh, start looking at the SmartKom tables and I will -	no
1397	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right.	no
1398	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I actually wanted to show that	no
1399	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Do you want to	no
1400	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Um, no I -	no
1401	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I actually made a mistake because it - it fell asleep and when Linux falls asleep on my machine it's - it doesn't wake up ever, so I had to reboot	no
1402	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Oh, no.	no
1403	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And if I reboot without a network, I will not be able to start SmartKom,	no
1404	transcript	transcript_Bed003	because I need to have a network.	no
1405	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Uh -	no
1406	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So we'll do that t- maybe uh -	no
1407	transcript	transcript_Bed003	But. O_K. But once you start - sart- start SmartKom you can be on - You don't have to be on a network anymore. Is that the deal?	no
1408	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yep.	no
1409	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Ah, interesting.	no
1410	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Why does SmartKom need a network?	no
1411	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Um -	no
1412	transcript	transcript_Bed003	you know, is - is that - is in the - written by the operating system only if it - if you get a D_H_C_P request, so it -	no
1413	transcript	transcript_Bed003	you know, my computer does not know its I_P address,	no
1414	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Ah.	no
1415	transcript	transcript_Bed003	you know?	no
1416	transcript	transcript_Bed003	You know. So.	no
1417	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Unless it boots up with networking.	no
1418	transcript	transcript_Bed003	It's plugged in. Yeah.	no
1419	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And I don't have an I_P address, they can't look up -	no
1420	transcript	transcript_Bed003	they don't know who localhost is, and so forth and so forth.	no
1421	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Hmm.	no
1422	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Always fun.	yes
1423	transcript	transcript_Bed003	But it's a, um,	no
1424	transcript	transcript_Bed003	simple solution. We can just um,	no
1425	transcript	transcript_Bed003	go downstairs and - and - and look at this, but maybe not today.	no
1426	transcript	transcript_Bed003	The other thing um -	no
1427	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I will -	no
1428	transcript	transcript_Bed003	oh yeah,	no
1429	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K, I have to report	no
1430	transcript	transcript_Bed003	um, data collection.	no
1431	transcript	transcript_Bed003	We interviewed Fey,	no
1432	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
1433	transcript	transcript_Bed003	She's willing to do it,	no
1434	transcript	transcript_Bed003	meaning be the wizard	no
1435	transcript	transcript_Bed003	for the data collection, also	no
1436	transcript	transcript_Bed003	maybe transcribe a little bit, if she has to,	no
1437	transcript	transcript_Bed003	but also recruiting subjects, organizing them, and so forth.	no
1438	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So that looks good.	no
1439	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Jerry however suggested that we should uh have a trial run with her,	no
1440	transcript	transcript_Bed003	see whether she can actually do all the uh spontaneous, eloquent and creativeness that we uh expect of the wizard.	no
1441	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And I talked to Liz about this and it looks as if Friday afternoon	no
1442	transcript	transcript_Bed003	will be the time when we have a first trial run	no
1443	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So who would be the subject	no
1444	transcript	transcript_Bed003	for the data.	no
1445	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Pardon me?	no
1446	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Who - Will there be a -	no
1447	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Is one - Is you - one of you gonna be the subject? Like are you -	no
1448	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Um Liz also volunteered to be the first subject,	no
1449	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Good.	no
1450	transcript	transcript_Bed003	which I think might be even better than us guys.	no
1451	transcript	transcript_Bed003	One of us, yeah.	no
1452	transcript	transcript_Bed003	If we do need her for the technical stuff, then of course one of you has to sort of uh - jump in.	no
1453	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I like how we've -	no
1454	transcript	transcript_Bed003	you guys have successfully narrowed it down.	no
1455	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"""Is one of"	no
1456	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Well I just figured it has to be someone who's, um,	no
1457	transcript	transcript_Bed003	familiar enough with the data to cause problems for the wizard,	no
1458	transcript	transcript_Bed003	so we can, uh, see if they're you know	no
1459	transcript	transcript_Bed003	good.	no
1460	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Oh plants? e- u- someone who can plant difficult	no
1461	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
1462	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I mean that's what we wanna	no
1463	transcript	transcript_Bed003	things.	no
1464	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Um,	no
1465	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Well, in this case it's a p- it's a	no
1466	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Isn't that what it is?	no
1467	transcript	transcript_Bed003	yes w- we - we would like to test the wizard,	no
1468	transcript	transcript_Bed003	but	no
1469	transcript	transcript_Bed003	unfamiliar with the task, or any of the set up, we get a more realistic	no
1470	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I guess that would be reasonable.	no
1471	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
1472	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
1473	transcript	transcript_Bed003	you know, set up as -	no
1474	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I know. That's probably a good enough test of -	no
1475	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Sort of having an actively antagonistic, uh -	no
1476	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
1477	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
1478	transcript	transcript_Bed003	That might be a little unfair.	no
1479	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Um.	no
1480	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
1481	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I'm sure if we uh, - You think there's a chance we might need Liz for,	no
1482	transcript	transcript_Bed003	whatever, the technical side of things?	no
1483	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I'm sure we can get	no
1484	transcript	transcript_Bed003	other people around who don't know anything	no
1485	transcript	transcript_Bed003	um,	no
1486	transcript	transcript_Bed003	if we want another subject. You know. Like I can drag Ben into it or something.	no
1487	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah, yeah.	no
1488	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Although he might cause problems	no
1489	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So, is it a experimental setup for the	no
1490	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"I like that. ""Test the wizard."""	no
1491	transcript	transcript_Bed003	um, data collection	no
1492	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I want that on a T_shirt.	no
1493	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Um - I think it's - it's - it's - I mean -	no
1494	transcript	transcript_Bed003	determined?	no
1495	transcript	transcript_Bed003	experimental setup u- on the technical issue yes, except we st-	no
1496	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I think we still need uh - a recording device for the wizard,	no
1497	transcript	transcript_Bed003	just a tape recorder that's running in a room.	no
1498	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
1499	transcript	transcript_Bed003	But um - in terms of specifying the scenario,	no
1500	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
1501	transcript	transcript_Bed003	um - uh - uh - we've gotten a little further but um -	no
1502	transcript	transcript_Bed003	we wanted to wait until we know who is the wizard, and have the wizard partake in the	no
1503	transcript	transcript_Bed003	ultimate	no
1504	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So - so if - if on Friday it turns out that she really likes it and - and we really like her,	no
1505	transcript	transcript_Bed003	then nothing should stop us from sitting down next week and	no
1506	transcript	transcript_Bed003	getting all the details completely figured out.	no
1507	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
1508	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And um -	no
1509	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K. So the ideal task um,	no
1510	transcript	transcript_Bed003	will have	no
1511	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I don't know how much the structure of the evolving Bayes-net	no
1512	transcript	transcript_Bed003	will af- affect - Like we wanna - we wanna be able to collect	no
1513	transcript	transcript_Bed003	right? in the course of the task?	no
1514	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Well not	no
1515	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Bu- e- e- e- I'm even -	no
1516	transcript	transcript_Bed003	This - this Tango, Enter, Vista is sort of, itself, an ad-hoc scenario.	no
1517	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
1518	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
1519	transcript	transcript_Bed003	The - the	no
1520	transcript	transcript_Bed003	data collection was the following.	no
1521	transcript	transcript_Bed003	The data we get from Munich is	no
1522	transcript	transcript_Bed003	very command line, simple linguistic stuff.	no
1523	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
1524	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Hardly anything complicated.	no
1525	transcript	transcript_Bed003	No metaphors whatsoever.	no
1526	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
1527	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Not a rich language.	no
1528	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So we wanted just to collect data,	no
1529	transcript	transcript_Bed003	to get -	no
1530	transcript	transcript_Bed003	that - that -	no
1531	transcript	transcript_Bed003	that	no
1532	transcript	transcript_Bed003	uh,	no
1533	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
1534	transcript	transcript_Bed003	that elicits	no
1535	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And we actually did	no
1536	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
1537	transcript	transcript_Bed003	you know? Just see what people say.	no
1538	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And then maybe we'll	no
1539	transcript	transcript_Bed003	the	no
1540	transcript	transcript_Bed003	you know, with	no
1541	transcript	transcript_Bed003	whatever engine we - we come up with.	no
1542	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Um.	no
1543	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So this - this -	no
1544	transcript	transcript_Bed003	this is a parallel track,	no
1545	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
1546	transcript	transcript_Bed003	you know,	no
1547	transcript	transcript_Bed003	there - they hopefully meet,	no
1548	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So in other words this data collection is	no
1549	transcript	transcript_Bed003	but since -	no
1550	transcript	transcript_Bed003	It should	no
1551	transcript	transcript_Bed003	tell us, you know, what kind of phenomenon	no
1552	transcript	transcript_Bed003	occur, it should tell us also maybe something about the difference between	no
1553	transcript	transcript_Bed003	people who think they speak to a computer versus people who think they speak to a human being and the sort of differences there.	no
1554	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
1555	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So it may get us some more information on the human-machine pragmatics, um,	no
1556	transcript	transcript_Bed003	that no one knows anything about,	no
1557	transcript	transcript_Bed003	as of yesterday.	no
1558	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And uh -	no
1559	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And secondly,	no
1560	transcript	transcript_Bed003	now that of course we have sort of started to lick blood with this,	no
1561	transcript	transcript_Bed003	and especially since um -	no
1562	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Johno can't stop Tango-ing,	no
1563	transcript	transcript_Bed003	we may actually include, you know,	no
1564	transcript	transcript_Bed003	those - those intentions.	no
1565	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So now I think we	no
1566	transcript	transcript_Bed003	at least one navigational task with - with sort of	no
1567	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
1568	transcript	transcript_Bed003	uh not	no
1569	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
1570	transcript	transcript_Bed003	and maybe some task where it's more or less explicit	no
1571	transcript	transcript_Bed003	that the person wants to take a picture,	no
1572	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
1573	transcript	transcript_Bed003	or see it or	no
1574	transcript	transcript_Bed003	something.	no
1575	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So that we can label it. I mean,	no
1576	transcript	transcript_Bed003	that's how we get a corpus that we can label.	no
1577	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
1578	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Exactly.	no
1579	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Whereas, you know,	no
1580	transcript	transcript_Bed003	if we'd just get data we'd never	no
1581	transcript	transcript_Bed003	we'd get no cues.	no
1582	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yep.	no
1583	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Alrighty.	no
1584	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
1585	transcript	transcript_Bed003	That was that.	no
1586	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So is this the official end of the meeting now?	no
1587	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yep.	no
1588	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Looks like it.	no
1589	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"So what's ""Economics, the fallacy""?"	no
1590	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I just randomly	no
1591	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Ma-	no
1592	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So that has nothing to do with economics or anything.	no
1593	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Oh, really? O_K.	no
1594	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Maybe we ought to switch off these things before we continue.	no
1595	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K. Switching o-	yes
1596	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Is it on?	no
1597	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	O_K, here we go.	no
1598	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Uh, so - uh, so I c- I definitely have to leave at three-thirty today for	no
1599	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So -	no
1600	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Definitely have to go to tea. So -	no
1601	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah, they're - they're having birthday cake and such and so I can't miss that.	no
1602	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	That too, but -	no
1603	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	You're a May birthday, right?	no
1604	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I'm a May birthday, yeah, so I have to -	no
1605	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Oops.	no
1606	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	yes
1607	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Um -	no
1608	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So,	no
1609	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	only a couple of agenda items, since no one sent me email for agenda items. Uh, the first is the I_B_M transcripts. I'd like to	no
1610	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	uh,	no
1611	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	brainstorm a little bit about what we can do with it.	no
1612	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	yes
1613	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
1614	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So we got back the I_B_M transcript, and the	no
1615	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	clearly wrong and there are a lot of areas where they put	no
1616	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	where the acoustics weren't very good. And I think that's	no
1617	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	The	no
1618	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Oops.	no
1619	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So it didn't align.	no
1620	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And that's	no
1621	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And I went in, and more or less by	no
1622	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	looked at it in - in Channeltrans and	no
1623	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	found the places where it got a- unsynchronized, and then either -	no
1624	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Hmm.	no
1625	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Inserted ones.	no
1626	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And in	no
1627	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	is that they put in it	no
1628	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Hmm.	no
1629	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	because the whole thing gets	no
1630	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	offset, and basically, it's assigning the wrong speaker to the text, and it all gets unaligned. So it's very difficult	no
1631	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Hmm.	no
1632	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	to	no
1633	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So this is -	no
1634	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	just to do that.	no
1635	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	For one meeting.	no
1636	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	this is one - it's one hour of - of - of speech?	no
1637	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yep.	no
1638	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And it took you a few hours to - to do it.	no
1639	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	It took me a couple hours to write the scripts, and then	no
1640	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	it - it probably took me	no
1641	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	maybe forty-five minutes,	no
1642	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	But, I think if we had some way - uh some	no
1643	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	it would make it a lot easier. Cuz	no
1644	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yep.	no
1645	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah, that's true. I've noticed that. Yeah.	no
1646	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And so there	no
1647	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Which makes sense.	no
1648	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	if we g- used different	no
1649	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	th-	no
1650	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Uh, well in - in some email that, uh, we had.	no
1651	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Oh, on the email.	no
1652	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	For -	no
1653	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Oh, oh, O_K.	no
1654	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
1655	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I didn't	no
1656	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah. Um - Because	no
1657	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So th- so this is the o- the other	no
1658	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
1659	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well, and then the	no
1660	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So -	no
1661	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Hunh.	no
1662	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Sort of a text template, but I don't know how	no
1663	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Uh-huh.	no
1664	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah, we don't know what their process is. So I had two ideas. The first was to provide them a text template that had both the beeps in it and the speaker I_Ds.	no
1665	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	we can do that.	no
1666	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
1667	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	"You know, just ""male-female"", ""English-nonEnglish"", ""one two three four""."	no
1668	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Um -	no
1669	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Can I - I - I just -	no
1670	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And they just filled it in.	no
1671	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	How- how many - how many beeps are there, and how many do we- were they -	no
1672	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	d- were - were off?	no
1673	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	It was like a hundred twenty, and they had a hundred twenty-three or something like that. Is that right?	no
1674	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Alright.	no
1675	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well, l- I- I thought it was a lot	no
1676	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And is it a -	no
1677	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well I - I don't remember.	no
1678	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	They were	no
1679	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah, and it was a hundred-ish.	no
1680	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And this is the mixed signal?	no
1681	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Hmm.	no
1682	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So - so if you get one -	no
1683	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	uh, uh, excuse me. If you get one off, it - t- everything is off	no
1684	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yep.	no
1685	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yep.	no
1686	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Uh, and this is all in one file that's continuous.	no
1687	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yep.	no
1688	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
1689	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So why don't you make it multiple files?	no
1690	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	How would that help?	no
1691	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Because then if they have one off, then - then it would only screw up that file.	no
1692	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Oh, you mean just break the one hour into	no
1693	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
1694	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	a few chunks.	no
1695	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I mean, it seems now, if you just ha- make one mistake then everything is off.	no
1696	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well the only - the only question about	no
1697	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So I don't know whether -	no
1698	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
1699	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I'm sure they would prefer it sort of one hour.	no
1700	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Can he send them - I guess he could send them multiple	no
1701	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Oh!	no
1702	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	tapes	no
1703	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Uh -	no
1704	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	"Yeah, just say, ""O_K, is -"""	no
1705	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	"ten minutes is -"" I mean,"	no
1706	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	maybe there's other things to do that are more	no
1707	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	then everything after that mistake is	no
1708	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
1709	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And, uh -	no
1710	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well, the only other issue is we'd have to worry about reassembling them in the proper order.	no
1711	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Uh -	no
1712	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
1713	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	That - I mean, just naming schemes will get -	no
1714	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	We can definitely do that. So t- so one question is, are there good places in the files where we can really do that?	no
1715	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well, the other thing - You can -	no
1716	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I mean, so - so - so someone will have to go through them and listen to them and pick a place to break them.	no
1717	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
1718	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	The	no
1719	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	the ones with the beeps that they're getting,	no
1720	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	that they made mistakes on is	no
1721	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	They are played from the	no
1722	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	the	no
1723	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Individual channels.	no
1724	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Individual channels.	no
1725	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	individual.	no
1726	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Or they're indivi- If it's individual, um -	no
1727	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	y- c- we can -	no
1728	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	where you c- include the beeps as words	no
1729	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	and pretty much figure out where the	no
1730	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I don't think we could do it on the	no
1731	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	But on the individual channels that would probably work,	no
1732	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	words in the transcript.	no
1733	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah, we - In fact, that's - Yeah, maybe we -	no
1734	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So, I mean, that's pretty quick to run. It - it's, um -	no
1735	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I mean, we could	no
1736	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Cuz if a beep is treated as a	no
1737	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	You mean, so, actually put - put the wavefile in with beep in it.	no
1738	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	"unique word, ""beep"" -"	no
1739	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	"Put in - put ""beep"" in as a word."	no
1740	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And pu- and have a beep model.	no
1741	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	We	no
1742	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah. Yeah. Well -	no
1743	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	the beep model - Actually, you could	no
1744	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	It would be very good.	no
1745	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Um -	no
1746	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yes, it would be, cuz it's very, very regular.	no
1747	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
1748	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah. So, um -	no
1749	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Oh. Kind of low variance, wouldn't that be?	no
1750	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
1751	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah,	no
1752	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
1753	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Um, that might actually -	no
1754	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	some infinities there, but -	no
1755	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	You have to - may - add some jitter to it.	no
1756	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Can I see that?	no
1757	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I mean, that might actually work, because you'll -	no
1758	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Where's the case?	no
1759	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I guess the trick is figuring out, you know, where it doesn't align?	no
1760	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	But if it's a problem of	no
1761	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	rather than	no
1762	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	um -	no
1763	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	that's easier	no
1764	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	It could t- it could -	no
1765	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	and it might work. Oh.	no
1766	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	There could be some missing ones. But -	no
1767	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So is this a	no
1768	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	It's just in	no
1769	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	M_one-hundred.	no
1770	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So I think - uh, Chuck had a good explanation for it which I liked, which is these - they're listening to it and so they write something down, and let's say they miss it, they	no
1771	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	M_one-hundred. Oh.	no
1772	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well, they hear the beep again. Was that	no
1773	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Oh, yeah.	no
1774	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	was, you could have a different tone for each	no
1775	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	You know, there's plenty of	no
1776	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And that might help	no
1777	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	the	no
1778	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	You know, give them a little	no
1779	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Or you could - you could have ascending tones, or something.	no
1780	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	What do you mean?	no
1781	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Uh -	no
1782	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Or -	no
1783	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
1784	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Increasingly high - higher frequencies.	no
1785	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	"You could have, um, each speaker in the meeting say ""beep"" and record it and that will be their pro-"	no
1786	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Oh was it? Oh.	no
1787	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	See, I should	no
1788	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Hmm.	no
1789	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And you know, since there are no more than,	no
1790	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	you know, ten speakers or so per meeting,	no
1791	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Oh.	no
1792	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well -	no
1793	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	there's plenty of tone space.	no
1794	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	But -	no
1795	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Uh, O_K, yeah. So the only -	no
1796	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Oh, O_K.	no
1797	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	they would really have a sense of whether they were going, you know, forward or backward or - Yeah.	no
1798	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Bo-eep	no
1799	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	In the end? Yeah.	no
1800	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well	no
1801	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So just r- r- truly chron- chromatically up	no
1802	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
1803	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well, it's a thought.	no
1804	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Interesting.	no
1805	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Oh, oh, th- oh, I see.	no
1806	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	It'd be impossible to r- to misorder them.	no
1807	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
1808	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
1809	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	But yo- I guess you'd still get the mistake that	no
1810	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	the person - I mean, if that's some of the errors, those would probably stay the same, regardless.	no
1811	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well -	no
1812	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yep.	no
1813	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I mean,	no
1814	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah, maybe.	no
1815	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And then when we get	no
1816	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	It would be much easier.	no
1817	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	That's probably better, yeah. S- scratch my other idea.	no
1818	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah, you have like a sanity - sanity check on them. That's a good idea. Alternating.	no
1819	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	It's pretty simple, pretty simple.	no
1820	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
1821	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yep.	no
1822	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
1823	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And it would - it seems like it would help	no
1824	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	just finished a long passage and they heard	no
1825	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	hear it again, they know it's the same	no
1826	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Versus if they heard a slightly different one.	no
1827	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
1828	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Hmm, interesting.	no
1829	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah, that's a good, like, error checking	no
1830	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	approach, I think.	no
1831	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah, we can,	no
1832	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	yeah, like, do - do, uh,	no
1833	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	"one for each ca- one for each person in the meeting, you can only hire people who have perfect pitch, and they can say ""A_flat"""	no
1834	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well.	no
1835	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Great idea, yeah.	no
1836	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	No, two is probably better than what I was suggesting, because what I was suggesting, in order to make it through a reasonable range for the whole	no
1837	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	thing, you'd have to have the -	no
1838	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	the tonal differences between the two kind of small, and actually you want them large. So.	no
1839	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yep.	no
1840	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	You'd have to - they'd have to have the acoustics of dogs t-	no
1841	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
1842	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
1843	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So I think,	no
1844	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	If they	no
1845	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
1846	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And then they could just fill that in.	no
1847	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Maybe I should write to Brian and tell him what the problem	no
1848	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So what -	no
1849	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right.	no
1850	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	See what he thinks would work best with	no
1851	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
1852	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I mean, what's going	no
1853	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well, as I	no
1854	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	you write down what you thought you heard,	no
1855	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	but you want to listen to it again, so you r- rewind.	no
1856	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And there are some -	no
1857	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And then you hear the beep	no
1858	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	or is that a new beep?	no
1859	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And there are	no
1860	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	very little	no
1861	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
1862	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
1863	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Maybe three of those in a	no
1864	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Um - See, they have th- Brian said the setup that they	no

1869	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And so they can	no
1870	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	and go back and hear it	no

1889	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well, they would have to have a mark.	no
1890	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	There'd be some kind of mark in front of it.	no

1893	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Oh, that's true.	no
1894	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well it would have t- yeah, it would have to be um,	no

1896	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
1897	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	But they might miss that, right?	no
1898	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Or maybe could it be a	no

1900	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Or a	no
1901	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well, it's sequential.	no
1902	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Or a beep and the number, and then - and then you just do the - the num- th- you do it as a d- a digit.	no
1903	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right, you would go sequential. So unless you got pretty unlucky,	no
1904	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Uh, right.	no
1905	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	what the person was saying and the number -	no
1906	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And then they'll hear the speech.	no
1907	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I think having a beep too is good.	no
1908	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So beep number. Yeah the- It's just getting pretty	no

1921	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	It's not a bad idea.	no
1922	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah. Keep	no

1927	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And it might be helpful to	no

1933	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Those transcriptionists need to know their place.	no
1934	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well,	no
1935	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	But it sounds like a k- a - a - a short conversation with Brian might be - might be helpful to get a sense of what's going on.	no

1941	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Othe- other than	no
1942	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I think it would be very helpful.	no
1943	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Just instead of the sequential number, for-	no
1944	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	perhaps just the speaker I_D	no

1952	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yep.	no
1953	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And then	no
1954	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no

1960	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	That also appeals to me. So that you don't have to, you know -	no
1961	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	That's a good idea.	no

2002	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I think -	no

2005	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah, if we - if we did mod ten, then -	no
2006	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2007	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right, but my	no
2008	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	there's a	no
2009	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	that this is only happening	no

2020	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no

2026	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well, and the	no
2027	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	It might make the transcript faster - W- wel- I mean I - A quick conversation with Brian would be good, so.	no
2028	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no

2030	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no

2047	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	and it costs them more time to do something different than what they're doing, which I don't know,	no
2048	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	then we could	no
2049	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	um, have a student or a transcriber run this alignment, or we can do it and -	no
2050	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yep.	no
2051	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	You know	no
2052	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	then you can iteratively	no
2053	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	figure out	no
2054	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	You know, Liz, all we would re-	no
2055	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	It would take a	no
2056	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right. I mean,	no
2057	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I mean if - in terms of the alignment, actually, all we would need is - we wouldn't even need	no
2058	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Cuz all we're really	no
2059	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well, the for- the	no
2060	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So if we had a -	no
2061	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
2062	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	to really run recognition?	no
2063	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well - l- I guess what I'm	no
2064	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Or - ?	no
2065	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	that a lot of times	no
2066	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	there will be - they'll put in question marks,	no
2067	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	that represent some unknown amount of speech, so we're gonna have to have some kind of -	no
2068	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right.	no
2069	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah, then we just map it to a	no
2070	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	In - and in fact, that's what we do	no
2071	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right, h-	no
2072	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	an	no
2073	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2074	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Um, so that's O_K. Just map that to reject and -	no
2075	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right.	no
2076	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well, what I was	no
2077	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2078	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	But that won't	no
2079	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah, you're still talking a forced al-	no
2080	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	The forced alignment might not work then,	no
2081	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Um -	no
2082	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well, but, all we'll get -	no
2083	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well, with the beep models, is what's really - you'd have really g- it would be really good though. So -	no
2084	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	The beep model is - is gonna match, like,	no
2085	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right.	no
2086	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	so it's p- so it's really just doing, yeah, a keyword, like a spotting for beep with -	no
2087	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right. But it'll - it'll grab the next beep, in other words. It'll be -	no
2088	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	You'll get back another offset.	no
2089	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Um - I mean, I was	no
2090	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	the recognizer will just go along and line up all the beeps,	no
2091	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	and then there'll be all the extra beeps at the end	no
2092	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	"wanted."""	no
2093	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right, you - you	no
2094	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So you need the word - you need the word to c- sort of control the relative location.	no
2095	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	to tell it where it got it	no
2096	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	No, I'm not sug- I'm not suggesting that we don't have anything	no
2097	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	It will tell you -	no
2098	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Oh.	no
2099	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	But I - what I'm saying is, what's	no
2100	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I think you	no
2101	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Because you have to know which ones match which.	no
2102	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right. Otherwise you just count up the total	no
2103	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And we can do that with	no
2104	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	number of beeps.	no
2105	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right? We	no
2106	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2107	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	spee- uh beep and non-beep all you would	no
2108	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right.	no
2109	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	You need some of the	no
2110	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	unless we insert a	no
2111	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	O_K.	no
2112	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	we need to	no
2113	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	figure out the beep	no
2114	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	alignment problem	no
2115	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	before the transcribers do the corrections here,	no
2116	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	good enough that the aligner	no
2117	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	constraints are good enough to sort of	no
2118	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	show you where the errors are, then	no
2119	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	it wouldn't work. But it	no
2120	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	on the words that usually get recognized correctly, which are the,	no
2121	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	you know, function words, the	no
2122	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well, actually, you know, there's an even easier way. We don't really need a beep model.	no
2123	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Um, just extract the segments and do a forced alignment,	no
2124	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right, you can also -	no
2125	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	and if the score is	no
2126	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	In fact that's what we do -	no
2127	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right. The individual segments	no
2128	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Um, if beeps were like the segments that we get from	no
2129	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	um, the transcription tool	no
2130	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	segments align and these don't.	no
2131	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Um, then you just have to go back in and figure out where the endpoints of those segments are, cuz some of them will be wrong.	no
2132	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Because the bi- the beeps were missing, by	no
2133	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right.	no
2134	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So do you get a score for each alignment? Is that what you get?	no
2135	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So it might actually work.	no
2136	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Um, you ca- you get, um -	no
2137	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Definitely when they don't align at all, it - it - it	no
2138	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I mean, that - that's how we found a lot of	no
2139	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
2140	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	problems	no
2141	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So a	no
2142	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
2143	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	that -	no
2144	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	the words don't match up.	no
2145	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I'm just wondering when - wha- what it means to fail.	no
2146	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Um -	no
2147	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Is it the - the likelihood scores below some threshold -	no
2148	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah, is, uh - it - Right.	no
2149	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	It can't match up the -	no
2150	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	That's why you actually need the text. In order to force you to try to match something that gives you a model to match against.	no
2151	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So - It's just an idea, if -	no
2152	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	if it turns out that -	no
2153	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I mean, I	no
2154	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	But it - if -	no
2155	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Suppose we get	no
2156	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	you know, per transcript, then we z-	no
2157	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	we might wanna try some approach like that.	no
2158	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well, the	no
2159	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
2160	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2161	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Where it is.	no
2162	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right.	no
2163	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2164	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	If - so, if that doesn't add time for	no
2165	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yep.	no
2166	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I think it would	no
2167	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	We have to ask them.	no
2168	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Uh - uh, again, especially if there's hundred - many hundreds or thousands I still think it would - it would cut the incidence of this a lot if it was possible to break it into a couple files.	no
2169	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Interesting, yeah.	no
2170	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I guess	no
2171	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	it's quicker to load a smaller file -	no
2172	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	into the - You know, t- for the checking problem.	no
2173	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah, I mean, we could certainly break the meetings -	no
2174	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Into	no
2175	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	We could	no
2176	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	twenty minutes chunks or something, or -	no
2177	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So, just -	no
2178	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I mean, you've already broken them into	no
2179	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Just -	no
2180	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Just accumulate it till you get twenty minutes worth?	no
2181	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	make	no
2182	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	There's one file.	no
2183	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yep.	no
2184	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And then it will be, you know, this - Eve- every now and then there'll be a - a beep missing.	no
2185	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So, someone's gonna talk to Brian.	no
2186	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah, I'll -	no
2187	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I think that was	no
2188	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I'll talk to him.	no
2189	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	O_K.	no
2190	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yep.	no
2191	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I also looked thr- over the text and I was impressed by the accuracy, it looks really good.	no
2192	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah, it	no
2193	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	significant.	no
2194	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	They were all things that I could easily listen to and	no
2195	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	sometimes convince myself they said one thing and sometimes the other, so.	no
2196	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah, it's there. Mm-hmm.	no
2197	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I haven't looked at these, um -	no
2198	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	cuz I was gone last week, but -	no
2199	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	but Don had told me that there's a difference in some of the conventions?	no
2200	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Oh. Yes. But this is not important. It's systematic, yeah.	no
2201	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So - but those are all	no
2202	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2203	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	O_K.	no
2204	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And - and Brian actually forwarded me in advance. He - he wor- he very nicely worked out	no
2205	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	a set of	no
2206	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	O_K.	no
2207	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So we can just map -	no
2208	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	map them to -	no
2209	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	No problem.	no
2210	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Great.	no
2211	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Hmm.	yes
2212	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	O_K.	no
2213	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Um -	no
2214	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	We still haven't really sat down and talked about file reorganization,	no
2215	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	But I don't think we need to do that in this meeting.	no
2216	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	But, uh -	no
2217	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	It	no
2218	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So we don't waste a lot of tapes.	no
2219	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	But, uh -	no
2220	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So - let's - let's try to	no
2221	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah. We can do it this week.	no
2222	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2223	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Um -	no
2224	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	We also still	no
2225	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I thought we were going to get two more of the	no
2226	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	ones -	no
2227	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And just swap	no
2228	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah, we could certainly do that.	no
2229	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So why not?	no
2230	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So -	no
2231	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	uh, Morgan, just to -	no
2232	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	uh, since you weren't at the meeting	no
2233	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Um, I wouldn't - well, it -	no
2234	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	"they didn't say ""hate"" but they -"	no
2235	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	they c- they come on time to their meetings in order to not be	no
2236	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Can I - I c- I -	no
2237	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I mean, that's - that's -	no
2238	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	mikes.	no
2239	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Um -	no
2240	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Which one is these? The uh -	no
2241	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	There were a few people - you, and like, three or four people who	no
2242	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	The Crown.	no
2243	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Uh-huh.	no
2244	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah,	no
2245	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And e- and th- all the others	no
2246	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	really don't.	no
2247	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So what I was	no
2248	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	when you fill out the	no
2249	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So, I mean, that's easy to do. Um -	no
2250	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	it - it -	no
2251	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	moves us	no
2252	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	But -	no
2253	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	The	no
2254	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	It	no
2255	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2256	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So I- I don't know if it's a noticeable	no
2257	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I mean, I p- I personally really	no
2258	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	different preferences.	no
2259	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	You know, there are	no
2260	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	having	no
2261	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	O_K.	no
2262	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	uh -	no
2263	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	For instance, jus- just the fact that people sit in different positions, different times, the - exactly where they put it with respect to their mouth is different each time.	no
2264	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yep.	no
2265	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Uh -	no
2266	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I - I just don't - I mean, I think we - we're - we're getting rid of	no
2267	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
2268	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	the other stuff is just gonna - some variability we're gonna have to accept.	no
2269	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	It's - I - I understand, that's fine with me. I - I g-	no
2270	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Uh-huh.	no
2271	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	you know, bending it, and then it's n- and I never really know -	no
2272	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah, see I - I happen to like the old one better.	no
2273	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	You do? O_K.	no
2274	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	But -	no
2275	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2276	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	What about just a different	no
2277	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And some people do, but -	no
2278	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Or even if we could attach two headband - Like, I don't	no
2279	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I mean -	no
2280	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	We abs- th-	no
2281	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	We have lots o- of choices of microphones. So -	no
2282	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	they bounce around.	no
2283	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I mean, can we keep the	no
2284	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
2285	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	somehow attach a more comfortable	no
2286	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	thing over your head?	no
2287	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2288	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	the	no
2289	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right.	no
2290	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Hmm.	no
2291	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And for some of the others, it's - their ears were shaped in a way that	no
2292	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	didn't hold the -	no
2293	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right.	no
2294	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I mean, so we can go microphone shopping, and get - get more microphones. It's just - w-	no
2295	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Then they have to be rewired though, don't they?	no
2296	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I'm just not sure what we should do.	no
2297	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2298	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And, uh, we're also gonna be integrating in this corpus stuff that's - that's being done at U_W,	no
2299	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yep.	no
2300	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	uh, with entirely different microphones. So I - I think,	no
2301	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	you know,	no
2302	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	getting away from the lapel,	no
2303	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	having close-mounted mikes, having people adjust them as they're most - as - as - as comfortable as they can -	no
2304	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I think that's sort of the big deal.	no
2305	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	we should get mikes that people like.	no
2306	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2307	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2308	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And so I-	no
2309	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2310	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So should I just go	no
2311	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2312	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	O_K.	no
2313	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	What about these -	no
2314	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And then also, should we go ahead and get another	no
2315	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	You know, for whatever it's gonna be, uh -	no
2316	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
2317	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Uh, another wireless system.	no
2318	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	You mean, another	no
2319	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Uh, no, actually, get - we need another box. Because each - each box in the back room can only take six.	no
2320	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Oh, to get r- to get rid of the wired things. Yes, absolutely.	no
2321	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So we could-	no
2322	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yep.	no
2323	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	O_K.	no
2324	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2325	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Uh, because - cuz we've had - With the exception of forgetting to change the batteries from time to time, uh, we've really had no tr-	no
2326	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So I'll just go d- I'll do that.	no
2327	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yep.	no
2328	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	and the wired stuff is just gonna continue to degrade as, you know, and	no
2329	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	nobody will remember how to -	no
2330	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Another one just bit the dust.	no
2331	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	yeah, nobody will remember how to repair a Jimbox or a Jimlet or a - you know, it's -	no
2332	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Really?	no
2333	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I	no
2334	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yep.	no
2335	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	O_K. Then I will just go do that, and send the bill to -	no
2336	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2337	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	uh,	no
2338	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Whoever will pay, yeah.	no
2339	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Whoever will pay.	no
2340	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah, yeah.	no
2341	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I have a quick question about microphones, um -	no
2342	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I got -	no
2343	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	this crazy idea that, um, i-	no
2344	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	in the future, people	no
2345	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	will just walk around with	no
2346	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	the microphones that they use for their cell phones?	no
2347	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	You know, these little boom ones,	no
2348	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	like, and really go to meetings with close talking mikes. If they're their own personal microphone.	no
2349	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And so I'm wondering if	no
2350	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	we can get a couple of tho- I don't know how good	no
2351	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Do you mean the kind that hang from the ear, sort of thing, or the -	no
2352	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	The k- kind that guys that like to look like they're really cool at	no
2353	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2354	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2355	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah, but I don't know	no
2356	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	This - it's - it's a cell phone jack.	no
2357	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	You	no
2358	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	You cannot miss it. They're the guys going around - they're probably talking to nobody, but	no
2359	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Is this - just this little -	no
2360	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Oh they - they have little headsets? Or what do they -	no
2361	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yep.	no
2362	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Th- d-	no
2363	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yes. They wear the heads-	no
2364	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yep.	no
2365	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	E- Well,	no
2366	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Oh you've - you've	no
2367	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Except that one's even bigger than most of the ones I've seen. Most of the ones are just a little boom.	no
2368	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So where - where does - how do you	no
2369	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	You - you put it over the corner of your ear.	no
2370	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah, over the corner of the ear -	no
2371	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I can't - I'm having competing microphone -	no
2372	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	There's	no
2373	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Huh.	no
2374	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yep. It just ha- just hangs down there. Yeah.	no
2375	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah,	no
2376	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	that hangs - has the mike on it.	no
2377	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	O_K, so whatever people sort of	no
2378	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	This one.	no
2379	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	wear to use l- Yeah, something like tha- with their cell phones,	no
2380	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
2381	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2382	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	it'd be really great, I think, if we can argue t- that -	no
2383	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	It's an interesting idea.	no
2384	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	people	no
2385	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	The	no
2386	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	the acoustics on this are really s- m-	no
2387	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah. The - the biggest issue is the stupid cable	no
2388	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	But - what -	no
2389	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Are they?	no
2390	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Why would it be cool?	no
2391	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	that Sony -	no
2392	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	The connector that Sony has, that, uh -	no
2393	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Oh, O_K.	no
2394	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So it's - they're not compatible?	no
2395	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	It's non-standard,	no
2396	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	and so you can't just plug something in. You need to get it wired.	no
2397	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Oh, I'm sorry. You're talking about that as a possible thing to plug into the Sonys. No?	no
2398	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well,	no
2399	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	um, just as an example for,	no
2400	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right.	no
2401	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	How standard are these?	no
2402	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Works with	no
2403	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	you know, the future, of the fact that maybe people	no
2404	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	to meetings, you know.	no
2405	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well, some people will, yeah.	no
2406	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Not a - I'm not saying there's not a far-field microphone,	no
2407	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	uh, application, but -	no
2408	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	If we have a choi- I've always wondered how well they would work.	no
2409	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	It	no
2410	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right.	no
2411	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	then we'd just have adaptors and people would plug	no
2412	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	You could use - they could use their own.	no
2413	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Oh, right. So they could use the -	no
2414	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I wonder if you	no
2415	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Anyway, it's just an idea. Um -	no
2416	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2417	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	An adaptor might be a better idea than do- redoing the wiring all the time.	no
2418	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well, I mean, another s-	no
2419	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	An- another side to that is that, um, in	no
2420	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	all comes together, supposedly we're gonna get two	no
2421	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	um, I_RAM boards.	no
2422	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right.	no
2423	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Uh, little later on in the year.	no
2424	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And so, we're gonna wanna be thinking in terms of some	no
2425	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	wireless connection	no
2426	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
2427	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	to it.	no
2428	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Um,	no
2429	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	so we have, you know, some kind of little something,	no
2430	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	and, uh, we have a wireless connection, this board, that's doing the computation for the f- the, uh -	no
2431	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	the recognition.	no
2432	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And so, you know, we wanna be able to show off to somebody,	no
2433	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	you know, we have a base station somewhere, and	no
2434	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	you're wandering around, uh,	no
2435	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	hands free, and -	no
2436	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yep.	no
2437	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I don't understand. So - so there's a mike that plugs in -	no
2438	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	You're saying there's a mike that plugs in to the	no
2439	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	No, no, what I'm saying is that we're gonna have to put together	no
2440	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	little superstructure, d-	no
2441	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Demo.	no
2442	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	do a whole lot, but it somehow connects	no
2443	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	uh, remotely	no
2444	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Oh, I see.	no
2445	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	In other words, we're - we're not gonna attempt to build, uh, it -	no
2446	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	do the real work of building a portable device that's little, that	no
2447	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	is doing all the computation we wanna do for the recognition and the far-field mike, uh,	no
2448	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	compensation and all that stuff. So we're gonna do all that on this powerful board,	no
2449	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	and, uh, have some wireless connection to it. And then the question is what is -	no
2450	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	what does it look like, does it look like	no
2451	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	something that you - you	no
2452	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	hold like	no
2453	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	or, uh,	no
2454	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	do we	no
2455	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So, it th- these are all possibilities.	no
2456	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yep.	no
2457	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I mean, what	no
2458	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	You know, with one of the r-	no
2459	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	short-range wireless.	no
2460	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And let th-	no
2461	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Just do - capture the audio on the P_D_A and send the audio over the	no
2462	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	wireless net.	no
2463	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah. So, is- is	no
2464	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	But.	no
2465	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Uh, Bluetooth is shorter range, but you could use Bluetooth.	no
2466	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Wh- whatever the network guys already have hooked up for this floor. I don't remember what it's called.	no
2467	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Hmm.	yes
2468	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	another issue on file reorganization is, uh,	no
2469	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	making data available to people outside ICSI.	no
2470	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So, specifically, the U_	no
2471	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	wanting to get	no
2472	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	uh, compromising security. Some pass- S_S_H tunneled	no
2473	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	C_V_S,	no
2474	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well, I- I was -	no
2475	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	and then give them access.	no
2476	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I was reading through some of the C_V_S documentation and you	no
2477	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yes, except that the command has to	no
2478	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Hmm.	no
2479	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Because it- it's non-interactive. And so the only way to	no
2480	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Hmm.	no
2481	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So we	no
2482	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	But I am sure that people have done it because it's gonna be a problem a lot of people have.	no
2483	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	But, um -	no
2484	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Who - Well, we're s- talking about a fairly limited group, are - are - is it a small enough group that they would - could just have accounts? Does that solve anything?	no
2485	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Uh, n- n-	no
2486	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	not	no
2487	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I mean, so	no
2488	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2489	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well they're gonna have to have accounts -	no
2490	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	and do everything locally.	no
2491	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	If they use S_S_H they have to have an account anyways.	no
2492	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah, except they could share one.	no
2493	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well, but that's not -	no
2494	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	The, uh -	no
2495	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	the S_S_H accounts, and the	no
2496	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	user accounts don't have to be similar.	no
2497	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So.	no
2498	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I mean, there are lots of ways of doing it, but w- but	no
2499	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	if we can't figure out a remote way of doing it, just letting them log in to ICSI	no
2500	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	might be O_K.	no
2501	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
2502	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And the audio files, it's not worth doing cuz they're too big. You're never gonna be copying them around	no
2503	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	and making working copies of them.	no
2504	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right.	no
2505	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And then the other issue Jane and I spoke of	no
2506	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	"That right now, lots of people create the files and then we have group ""Meeting Recorder""."	no
2507	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	But that means anyone in the Meeting Recorder	no
2508	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And so that's a pretty coarse level of	no
2509	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	for those files, and then doing group slightly differently. But -	no
2510	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Can you just do, like, S_U_X or something to modify -	no
2511	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I think what we have now -	no
2512	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I mean, if you just have one user that -	no
2513	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Another option is to m-	no
2514	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	make a non-	no
2515	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	make it owned by a not real user, and then	no
2516	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	But	no
2517	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I had another thought.	no
2518	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
2519	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So th- I don't think that's a good solution.	no
2520	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Would - w- would it be possi- There are scripts that uh, run,	no
2521	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	and - and when it's finished compressing, would it be possible for the script to change the permissions on the file to be more strict?	no
2522	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Have	no
2523	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	But after the meeting's done, would they want to?	no
2524	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah, as I said, it's just a question of,	no
2525	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	uh, do you wanna have to track down root	no
2526	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	if you have to make any change.	no
2527	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	But it doesn't have to be root. It could be some other user that we all can S_U_X	no
2528	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	That's true.	no
2529	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	You have security issues with that.	no
2530	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So.	no
2531	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah, that's true.	no
2532	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I mean -	no
2533	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	That's what we do with doctor-speech though, right?	no
2534	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	No, with doctor-speech, it's just a group.	no
2535	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So - there're lots of different owners of i- i- of the files, but the group is always doctor-speech.	no
2536	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Or real, usually.	no
2537	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	But there is a	no
2538	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right?	no
2539	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I mean, I - I S_U_X to doctor-speech w- when I need to make a -	no
2540	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Nnn-	no
2541	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Oh,	no
2542	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Oh. So tha-	no
2543	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	that's what I meant, it - just some	no
2544	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	a directory on, uh, one of the -	no
2545	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	"user like ""meeting-root"" or something."	no
2546	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Oh, O_K.	no
2547	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I don't know.	no
2548	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I mean, I'm not	no
2549	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	But -	no
2550	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2551	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Also it seems like once it's been stored that night, it's - it's possible to recover from backups,	no
2552	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	so that the main risk is avoiding it being accidentally deleted during the day that it was recorded.	no
2553	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well, and just - You, then, also just have the general problem of permission on the other files,	no
2554	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	that, do you want people checking out a transcript file	no
2555	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	when they find an error,	no
2556	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	and	no
2557	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2558	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2559	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And I'd prefer it to go through me.	no
2560	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	rather than just - them just going in and correcting it.	no
2561	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well I p- At	no
2562	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well, with C_V_S, though, you don't actually have to	no
2563	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well, but -	no
2564	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	You have a	no
2565	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2566	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	What I'm saying is that it can	no
2567	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	w- w-	no
2568	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well-	no
2569	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right?	no
2570	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right.	no
2571	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I mean, it's not like it's one or the other. We can do both.	no
2572	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah, you can -	no
2573	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right, so you could get email.	no
2574	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Send email to Jane that someone has done a	no
2575	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right.	no
2576	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I - I wanna	no
2577	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	revision.	no
2578	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	uh, uh, My - my	no
2579	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	it can go into this next ro- this next realm. But it - it's sort of counter-productive to have	no
2580	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well, so, you don't have to	no
2581	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	to the	no
2582	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2583	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So the question is s- w-	no
2584	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And then after	no
2585	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2586	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So you would keep it in a separate file structure until you were ready to put it in the repository.	no
2587	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Good, good.	no
2588	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Or just keep the lock on it.	no
2589	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Is C_V_S, like - Yeah, just keep the	no
2590	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I mean, just check it out - check it out and don't let anyone check it out -	no
2591	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Until you're - Yep.	no
2592	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	No, it does not - the	no
2593	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Oh, it -	no
2594	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Oh, it doesn't. Oh, O_K.	no
2595	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	There's no - there's no lock when you check something out, not like R_C_S.	no
2596	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	In other words,	no
2597	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Oh.	no
2598	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	"The C_ stands for ""concurrent""."	no
2599	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So why not use R_C_S at that point? Just at that stage?	no
2600	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Cuz it's not remote.	no
2601	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	It's not remote.	no
2602	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	The nice thing about C_V_S is - is, you can be on a different machine.	no
2603	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	But at that point -	no
2604	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	we only	no
2605	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	No, because U_W	no
2606	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	wants to have access to these	no
2607	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	But not to	no
2608	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	"Well, if they k- en- if they record a meeting, and they create a ""key"" file, and they find an error in their ""key"" file,"	no
2609	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	they shouldn't have to tell	no
2610	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	so that they can create -	no
2611	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	correct an error in one of	no
2612	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	"Well, the """	no
2613	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So that's why I wanna do it -	no
2614	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I don't	no
2615	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	"ke- """	no
2616	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	"""Key"" fi-"	no
2617	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Different than	no
2618	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	"Well, ""key"" file has the extra attributes that if you notice that there are lots of spikes on channel so-and-so, it's useful as a repository for putting that there."	no
2619	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And also if you notice that	no
2620	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	"So I th- I think that the ""key"" file is usefu- for notations related to the meeting,"	no
2621	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well -	no
2622	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	B-	no
2623	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	But, I mean, the meetings are gonna be the same	no
2624	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	but it's	no
2625	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2626	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	"A few months later they listen to it and they say ""Ope!"	no
2627	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2628	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Why - why sh-	no
2629	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Then they should send that through - Well -	no
2630	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	It's sort of not really a question about	no
2631	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
2632	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	or they	no
2633	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And if they all	no
2634	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	transcribe and annotate.	no
2635	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And if they wanna make	no
2636	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	The - the p- the	no
2637	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2638	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah	no
2639	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And if	no
2640	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	they're not gonna	no
2641	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Or if we make it	no
2642	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So then if they do have acc-	no
2643	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I - I'm just looking at it the other way	no
2644	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	O_K, so what if they have -	no
2645	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	What if they have	no
2646	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So - so let's say we k-	no
2647	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	and they use R_C_S,	no
2648	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	at that point, where you can l- really lock a file.	no
2649	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I mean, I'm worried. If you can't lock a	no
2650	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Hmm.	no
2651	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Um -	no
2652	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And if they have accounts here and they're	no
2653	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	if they're so closely linked that they're actually	no
2654	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	then they	no
2655	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	by, you know, secure-shelling into ICSI,	no
2656	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	under R_C_S, at that point.	no
2657	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Ye- well, I don't see a real difference between R_C_S and any	no
2658	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I mean, it's just mechanisms. The nice thing about C_V_S is that	no
2659	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	you can have multiple people modifying and if the changes don't	no
2660	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	they can just	no
2661	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Hmm.	no
2662	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	That's interesting.	no
2663	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So the problem with	no
2664	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2665	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	want to modify a file at the same	no
2666	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	because the granularity of locking is at the file level.	no
2667	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	What- what does C_V_S do if they - if they	no
2668	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Uh, there're lots of different policies for dealing with it. So -	no
2669	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
2670	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	But typically a person has to,	no
2671	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2672	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	uh, mediate	no
2673	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Oh.	no
2674	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	you know, which changes actually get - go through.	no
2675	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah, to decide which one is - Yeah.	no
2676	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Oh.	no
2677	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Oh, I-	no
2678	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So, maybe there	no
2679	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	At the	no
2680	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Uh-huh.	no
2681	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Oh. So -	no
2682	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	C_V_S is pretty good.	no
2683	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So then you could use C_V_S	no
2684	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	and, you know, just f- have remote access, but then it's up to whoever	no
2685	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	O_K.	no
2686	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yep.	no
2687	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	is, sort of,	no
2688	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well, it's - it's just like source code, right?	no
2689	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So that, when you're developing it and it's really	no
2690	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2691	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	You wait to the point when you're ready to	no
2692	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah, so the w-	no
2693	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
2694	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	In-	no
2695	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	The - Maybe the model - It's a little bit different in C_V_S. When you check something out, you actually create your own directory with copies of everything in it, and that's what you	no
2696	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Copy.	no
2697	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So, until you're ready to check it in,	no
2698	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	nobody sees anything you've done. And then when you check it in, it puts, sort of, you know - every change that you've done is - goes into the central -	no
2699	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right.	no
2700	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So if that's at an-	no
2701	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Hmm.	no
2702	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I guess it depends on Jane's - Uh, you know, if that's - if that model	no
2703	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	that's	no
2704	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	um, allows	no
2705	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	someone to come in and modify while	no
2706	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	you know, would have been better to	no
2707	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	that's really up to	no
2708	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well,	no
2709	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I also think, um, that the type of change ch- ch- varies an- I think it's a very good point. Because what if	no
2710	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	the - uh, what if	no
2711	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	with reference to some	no
2712	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
2713	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And the	no
2714	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	quite unknowingly, was changing it the other way	no
2715	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Then you could end up with a	no
2716	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well yeah, there would - there would have to be somebody to enforce the consistency. Yeah.	no
2717	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	But I like b- I like what Liz is saying about -	no
2718	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	That's right. And I also like - I l- also like Liz's uh, k- um,	no
2719	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	"phraseology of ""at this level of"" - I don't remember how you put it,"	no
2720	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	and if it were an	no
2721	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	have	no
2722	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I'm just -	no
2723	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Imagine that we reverse this and	no
2724	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2725	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
2726	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	If I found an error,	no
2727	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	"and I sent them email and said ""here's this error"", and I didn't get a"	no
2728	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I would stop sending them the - my data and I would start collecting it here and we would end up with two corpora.	no
2729	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well, yeah.	no
2730	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And I	no
2731	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I agree.	no
2732	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well -	no
2733	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well, I see now, we're k- back into the same situation as when we were,	no
2734	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	uh, talking about a- allowing people to edit	no
2735	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	the transcripts before they	no
2736	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So there's a question of how easy or how hard to modify, and how that	no
2737	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
2738	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	impacts the amount of changing that's done.	no
2739	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And I - I think that it's, um,	no
2740	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I - I have received some suggestions for change, which I've	no
2741	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And um, I think with an	no
2742	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	But it	no
2743	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	having free reign to change these things, because of the need to have consistent conventions. And	no
2744	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	are only just	no
2745	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah, that's what	no
2746	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well, I think - yeah, I think there are probably ways that you can say that, you know, only certain users are allowed to change	no
2747	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2748	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	things.	no
2749	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
2750	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Uh, so we can probably restrict it to be -	no
2751	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	You know, f-	no
2752	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
2753	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	"Whereas we could say ""other people"", you know, ""these people are allowed to actually submit changes""."	no
2754	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right.	no
2755	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I mean,	no
2756	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I - I think	no
2757	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	there will never be a point where	no
2758	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	you know, we can say that for	no
2759	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	uh - f- You know,	no
2760	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	have	no
2761	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	um, handling changes in the	no
2762	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I agr- I agree but I have to also add	no
2763	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	u- This was mentioned at the beginning of the meeting.	no
2764	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	You said that there were	no
2765	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So there - it's	no
2766	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah. Exactly.	no
2767	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
2768	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right.	no
2769	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	even if they were	no
2770	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So, sometimes it isn't right and wrong, sometimes it's multiple interpretations, and -	no
2771	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2772	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Good point. Yeah.	no
2773	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Now - But of course, this	no
2774	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	um, an extra annotation for, you know, alternative interpretations of a stretch.	no
2775	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
2776	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	But I just wanted to say it isn't simply right or wrong.	no
2777	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah, that's a good point.	no
2778	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Or overlooked or not overlooked.	no
2779	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Sometimes they're truly ambiguous, and	no
2780	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
2781	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	um, uh, um, nice to have a	no
2782	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Gotta go.	no
2783	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2784	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I mean, I like that idea because even a casual user can always send	no
2785	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
2786	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	to whoever's in charge, and say,	no
2787	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	"you know, ""we'd like these changes"" and,"	no
2788	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well -	no
2789	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	you know, hopefully we'll give them a response. And if they really do it a	no
2790	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I just - I don't s-	no
2791	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I don't see that this is e-	no
2792	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yep.	no
2793	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	"""we're a casual user but we want a chance to change the"	no
2794	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	face that if it	no
2795	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	"Can you write ""unread"" on that?"	no
2796	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah, thank you.	no
2797	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I don't really see the people at U_W that I	no
2798	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Probably not	no
2799	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And they're	no
2800	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2801	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And so - you know, it's the same as source code. You - you release source code at some point.	no
2802	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And, either	no
2803	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah I mean a lot of the open source pro-	no
2804	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	projects face this same problem.	no
2805	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right.	no
2806	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	You know, p-	no
2807	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	but	no
2808	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right.	no
2809	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	until we get feedback from people, but	no
2810	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	what	no
2811	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	with	no
2812	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	sort of a	no
2813	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	and some people with permissions,	no
2814	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	maybe by	no
2815	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	a file by	no
2816	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
2817	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Um, and then just	no
2818	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
2819	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	seeing if that is enough to -	no
2820	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	to handle the transcript changes.	no
2821	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I'm just worried about	no
2822	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	letting everybody go in and make	no
2823	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	trying to, I don't know, run alignments and there's a word you wanna fix, to go in and do that and then mess up	no
2824	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	if you don't know,	no
2825	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	you know, the overall philosophy behind the - the conventions.	no
2826	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
2827	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right.	no
2828	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Then - There is also the possibility - Remember, in C_V_S, when we talk about making changes,	no
2829	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	You can back everything out.	no
2830	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	there's sort of two types that can be made.	no
2831	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	or to the	no
2832	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
2833	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And so people can make	no
2834	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right.	no
2835	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Exactly.	no
2836	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	that's, you know, in their - that's only on them. It's w- it's the checking	no
2837	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
2838	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Or just, yeah, start by make it a really tight control and then as people really need the control you can	no
2839	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
2840	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
2841	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah. They can still check it out -	no
2842	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	ascertain whether or not to -	no
2843	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah, cuz they can still check out full copies and make whatever changes they want to their local copies.	no
2844	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right.	no
2845	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And it won't affect the - the g- the global, official, ones at all.	no
2846	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right.	no
2847	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right, but what I want to	no
2848	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2849	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yes.	no
2850	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And so if you make it too hard for them to check back in, they'll check it out once,	no
2851	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Definitely.	no
2852	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yep.	no
2853	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	they'll make all the changes, they'll never tell	no
2854	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
2855	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	and we'll get two different corpora.	no
2856	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
2857	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right?	no
2858	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I think we're	no
2859	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	places, you know -	no
2860	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	But you can	no
2861	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	um, annotations on one version and you don't have the latest corrections maybe at that	no
2862	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	you have to	no
2863	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And the b-	no
2864	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	the	no
2865	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	knowing where the synch time boundaries are.	no
2866	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Cuz you can automatically pretty much	no
2867	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	and the	no
2868	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	have changed, or you can't correspond to a previous version with synch times, that you get in trouble.	no
2869	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So.	no
2870	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Was there anything else on your list?	no
2871	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Nope.	no
2872	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Shall we do some digits?	yes
2873	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Uh, Transcript L_ one one six.	no
2874	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Now, wait, are - are we doing them simultaneously or one at a time?	no
2875	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I wasn't	no

2922	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K.	no
2923	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	sort of last minute stuff to- to, uh, try to get some recognition results.	no
2924	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Recognition results	no
2925	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
2926	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So, uh, on - on - on meeting data.	no
2927	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	And so, I'm - I'm not sure exactly what you're doing already, and - and there's some stuff I've talked to Dave -	no
2928	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Well, we- I just started recognition on the	no
2929	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	on Thilo's	no
2930	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	which was - but using the far- far-	no
2931	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	the	no
2932	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K. So -	no
2933	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Um -	no
2934	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	And you wanted - I know you wanted the far-field	no
2935	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right. So - so, we have	no
2936	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	near - near-field results.	no
2937	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Uh-huh.	no
2938	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	We wanted to get the far-field results for that.	no
2939	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	And then this - this real, uh, long shot thing would be, that we'd apply Dave's processing	no
2940	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	to, uh, potentially training	no
2941	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
2942	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	and do the - look at the same thing. And	no
2943	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	in talking this morning with, uh, Chuck and with Dave	no
2944	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	one thought was to use - We couldn't remember how	no
2945	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	different the numbers were, but if you just	no
2946	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	there're - there're - uh, I think Chuck's recollection was that when he was doing the feature stuff, it took maybe a day and a half	no
2947	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	to do the training. Yeah.	no
2948	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	To retrain?	no
2949	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Uh	no
2950	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
2951	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Um.	no
2952	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	That's about right.	no
2953	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Actually, it should probably be -	no
2954	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	It depends on who else is using machines, but we have more machines now. So.	no
2955	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	That's true.	no
2956	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	It's more like a day, probably.	no
2957	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Um, how much worse is the short training set than the large one, in terms of the ultimate performance?	no
2958	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mmm, it's like -	no
2959	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Something like three - three percent -	no
2960	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	three or four percent absolute.	no
2961	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yep.	no
2962	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So, it's - that should be fine for this, I would think.	no
2963	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So we - an- and you have the short - you have short training results for	no
2964	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	the close	no
2965	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Um, not for meetings.	no
2966	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Because we didn't train -	no
2967	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	we didn't re- ever recognize with the -	no
2968	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	with the	no
2969	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	small models	no
2970	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	But I - I have the models, so I could	no
2971	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So, how do you know it's - ? Oh, it's three percent on - on, uh, on Hub-five.	no
2972	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	run reco-	no
2973	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	On -	no
2974	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Hub-five.	no
2975	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I see.	no
2976	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah. But we have the models so we could get that number, and -	no
2977	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So the question is, what - ?	no
2978	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	w-	no
2979	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	The recognition also takes	no
2980	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	we might wanna restrict it to, maybe, a few meetings,	no
2981	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	if you want to do a full comparison.	no
2982	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	It has to be enough so that -	no
2983	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Uh.	no
2984	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I mean, it's the non-overlap only.	no
2985	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Um -	no
2986	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	And -	no
2987	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	it has to be enough to be	no
2988	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	you folks were seeing and what you reported already.	no
2989	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Hmm.	no
2990	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I mean -	no
2991	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Well, do we have the - do we have the processed data? That - that's also -	no
2992	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	No. He has to create that.	no
2993	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
2994	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	But - but - s- but - so -	no
2995	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Um -	no
2996	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	We have	no
2997	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mmm.	no
2998	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	which are all with digits.	no
2999	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I see.	no
3000	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	And - and - and Dave has been working with that and there's all of those issues.	no
3001	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	But -	no
3002	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	And, um, so -	no
3003	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	We already have these results that you - I mean, on -	no
3004	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	uh, a l- a lot- tha- tha-	no
3005	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	a particular test set, that you - that we reported at H_L_T.	no
3006	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Hmm.	no
3007	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
3008	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Um, it'd be nice to have something	no
3009	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Um, and then,	no
3010	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	uh, if we could on top of that - I mean, so this is gonna be a lot worse. Right?	no
3011	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Whatever comparison we - w- w- one would presume. But we don't know how	no
3012	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
3013	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
3014	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	w- w- uh, which is certainly one interesting thing.	no
3015	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	And then, um,	no
3016	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Dave - I think we figured that it'd probably take a day or two to compute the -	no
3017	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	the, uh -	no
3018	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	uh -	no
3019	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Well -	no
3020	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	How many hours of training - ?	no
3021	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Actually, I did retrain -	no
3022	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I recently retrained,	no
3023	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	um,	no
3024	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	for another reason, on the full training set.	no
3025	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	And that took only -	no
3026	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I think it took only two days.	no
3027	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3028	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So, it's actually conceivable	no
3029	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	to do - use the full training set.	no
3030	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah, but we also have to do this other processing, so having a smaller training set, if it's only a few percent difference, it might be -	no
3031	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Oh, I see.	no
3032	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	be worth doing it.	no
3033	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	How big is the small	no
3034	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Do you remember?	no
3035	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Hmm.	no
3036	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Uh.	no
3037	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Hhh.	no
3038	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I don't know, something -	no
3039	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	something like -	no
3040	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	something	no
3041	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	thirty and fifty hours, maybe. I f- I forget the	no
3042	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	It's around there.	no
3043	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	exac- Right.	no
3044	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	And ha- and - and male is roughly half of that, or - ?	no
3045	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Or - or - or was that only male?	no
3046	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Well, that's only male.	no
3047	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Uh. Actually, I don't know.	no
3048	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I - I can look it up.	no
3049	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	It's - it's - it's just, uh, I don't know the - remember the - the number.	no
3050	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	We could only jus- just do the male only right? Or	no
3051	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K.	no
3052	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Well, the males	no
3053	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	will we run into trouble when we g- ?	no
3054	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3055	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah. I would say we - you do only males.	no
3056	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3057	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So -	no
3058	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah. So that's certainly part of the issue, is that right now he's - he hasn't written his stuff for efficiency.	no
3059	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah. It's - it's in Matlab and so on, and -	no
3060	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
3061	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	And, uh, it's not an	no
3062	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	guesstimating it was like one and a half times faster than real time, or something?	no
3063	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So, if there's thirty hours of data, you can calculate	no
3064	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	u-	no
3065	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	that he can do, uh, the enhancement in	no
3066	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	a day	no
3067	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	and something. So -	no
3068	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Hmm.	no
3069	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	But	no
3070	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	No. It's definitely -	no
3071	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	It's less than a hundred hours, for sure. It's -	no
3072	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3073	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	It's probably actually, uh -	no
3074	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	It's - uh, I think it's around thirty hours	no
3075	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	just for -	no
3076	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	That's what I was thinking. Yeah.	no
3077	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3078	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	for one gender. Yeah.	no
3079	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah. So, I mean, it's a bit of a push, but it seems like,	no
3080	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K, we've got some models, we've got some training data, we have software that works, he's got	no
3081	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	a method that helps with, you know, other ta- another task.	no
3082	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Um -	no
3083	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	It, you know,	no
3084	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	S-	no
3085	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
3086	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Um -	no
3087	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So - We- Yo- So, one thing I was wondering is,	no
3088	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	did you already do that middle one or should	no
3089	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	we re-do that one, too?	no
3090	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	No. I didn't do that, because we haven't even	no
3091	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	You didn't do that. O_K.	no
3092	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	cut the waveforms for that. So -	no
3093	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah. That's what I was gonna say next. We hafta	no
3094	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right. So.	no
3095	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	W- s- so is - Morgan, is the plan to just pick one of the far-field mikes? Uh -	no
3096	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	And there's a bit of a question whether you want to use -	no
3097	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yes.	no
3098	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	um, what segmentations you want to use.	no
3099	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Uh -	no
3100	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Uh, David just -	no
3101	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Um, I'm sorry.	no
3102	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	a new	no
3103	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	version of the first meetings that we had previously recognized, but with different segmentation. And so -	no
3104	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Um -	no
3105	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	It would be	no
3106	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I mean, if the results are	no
3107	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	to use those segmentations, because	no
3108	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	th- then we could claim that everything's automatic.	no
3109	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Do you know	no
3110	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
3111	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Well, I'm - as I said, I just started	no
3112	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	um -	no
3113	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	It will -	no
3114	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	uh,	no
3115	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	before I have some results. So -	no
3116	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Oh. Well, that's not bad.	no
3117	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Oh, O_K. So - cuz I don't think the new data	no
3118	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	will be ready, uh,	no
3119	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	for a couple days may- probably.	no
3120	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	You mean the training.	no
3121	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So, the training.	no
3122	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	But the segmentations matter for the	no
3123	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3124	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	filtering. Right? Because -	no
3125	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	For the	no
3126	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	For the test set. Yeah. So,	no
3127	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah, fo-	no
3128	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3129	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	need to be -	no
3130	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	But, first - first,	no
3131	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	of course, you would wanna process the	no
3132	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
3133	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3134	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I mean, it - it'd be really	no
3135	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	i- i-	no
3136	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I mean, since you're gonna find out in a short amount of time, that's great.	no
3137	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
3138	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	But i- if - if it doesn't work out, I think we would rather charge ahead with the older	no
3139	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
3140	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	segmentations and -	no
3141	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
3142	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Um, and we were gonna use one of the P_Z_Ms.	no
3143	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I don- I don't know what -	no
3144	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Probably whatever one you've been using for - for - for the digits. Is it this one?	no
3145	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I think it's that one. Right?	no
3146	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	It's e- F_.	no
3147	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	F_.	no
3148	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah, that's it.	no
3149	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I - I'd - which - ? That's F_? How do you know?	no
3150	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	That's F_.	no
3151	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	It's the second nearest the machine room.	no
3152	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Oh.	no
3153	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Alright, so -	no
3154	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Bet they'll have fun with that one.	no
3155	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K, so.	no
3156	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Uh -	no
3157	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K. So, uh, I just want to make sure I understand what we need to run.	no
3158	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Um -	no
3159	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Let's see. So, it's - O_K, so if we're talking about - Let's - let's assume that we're gonna use the new segmentations.	no
3160	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	We need to,	no
3161	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	um,	no
3162	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	run recognition o- just looking at the no overlap column.	no
3163	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Basically, we have to d- r- do recognitions for all three of those cases. Right?	no
3164	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
3165	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
3166	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Um, because	no
3167	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	uh, model - short training set for the male. So we need to have results for all three of those, even though we have -	no
3168	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
3169	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Ma- maybe you should limit ourselves to the Meeting Recorder	no
3170	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	meetings?	no
3171	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K.	no
3172	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Um,	no
3173	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	if you were gonna cut down on the test set, I would suggest that.	no
3174	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Well -	no
3175	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Maybe. But, I - I mean, how long does it take	no
3176	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Actually, the longer - the Robustness meetings take longer, because there's this one speaker who talks a lot.	no
3177	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	for the test?	no
3178	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	And so	no
3179	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	the -	no
3180	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Um. No. It's because for all the -	no
3181	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	for the adaptation and normalization steps, you cannot -	no
3182	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	you have to d- you have to, uh, um,	no
3183	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	you cannot chop it up into small pieces.	no
3184	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So, you're sort of limited by how long the longest speaker,	no
3185	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	uh,	no
3186	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	is s- speaking.	no
3187	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So how much data there is from the - the speaker who talks the most.	no
3188	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So,	no
3189	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	um, you parallelize across different	no
3190	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
3191	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	but	no
3192	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	you know, if you have a bunch of speakers who speak very little and then one wh-	no
3193	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
3194	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	who - who speaks a lot, then	no
3195	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	effectively, everybody waits for the longest one to process. So.	no
3196	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
3197	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3198	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	But what - what was your result for - uh, that we had at the H_L_T? Was that a combination of me?	no
3199	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	That was both types of meetings, but most - but there were only two Robustness meetings, and four or five,	no
3200	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	And if we're re-doing the baseline anyways, it - it - it would be O_K. Right? I mean -	no
3201	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	uh, Meeting Recorders.	no
3202	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
3203	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	To - to just limit ourselves to a smaller -	no
3204	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	How long would it take to run recognition, if we did that?	no
3205	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Oh.	no
3206	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Uh, I - I -	no
3207	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I don't have - I don't have a good	no
3208	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I mean, is - is it like a	no
3209	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	For everything? For all the meetings?	no
3210	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	For - yeah, let's say we	no
3211	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Uh.	no
3212	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Um.	no
3213	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	It's probably more than a day, but probably less than two.	no
3214	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Oh, really. I didn't realize each test took that long.	no
3215	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Well, i- No. I mean for all the meetings.	no
3216	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Because it's -	no
3217	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Again, it's, um -	no
3218	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So you were doing like -	no
3219	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	uh, something like -	no
3220	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Again, we - we - I ran - when we ran these,	no
3221	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	we were sort of short on machines, and, um,	no
3222	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mmm.	no
3223	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I don't know, I - I would estimate maybe four hours per meeting.	no
3224	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Something like that.	no
3225	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Four hours per meeting.	no
3226	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
3227	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Wow.	no
3228	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah. But if you -	no
3229	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So, if you do half a dozen meetings, that's - that's about a day. We also have more machines now.	no
3230	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
3231	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right. So that's why I'm saying I'm not sure how they would scale with more machines.	no
3232	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3233	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3234	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I mean, if we had about six - A six hour test set's not bad. Right?	no
3235	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
3236	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	S- six hour test set.	no
3237	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Six meetings. O_K.	no
3238	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	You know?	no
3239	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right? I mean, a lot of the evaluations have been -	no
3240	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah. We did.	no
3241	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	We have M_R -	no
3242	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	two, th- We have two, three, four, fi- I think there are four Meeting Recorder meetings that we worked with.	no
3243	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Four that you worked with?	no
3244	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I think it's -	no
3245	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Is it the same set as	no
3246	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3247	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Five?	no
3248	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K.	no
3249	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	That would be O_K, too. I mean, I'm -	no
3250	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	i- So, if they have a set that they worked with, and you - you got -	no
3251	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Did you	no
3252	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	do similarly in performance between them and the other meetings, or was it - ?	no
3253	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Uh, with the Robust- compared to Robustness?	no
3254	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3255	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	The big variation is by - whether it's a native speaker	no
3256	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3257	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	or not.	no
3258	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	And whether	no
3259	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	it's, um -	no
3260	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Uh, I think that's the o- actually - and - and of course what,	no
3261	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	um,	no
3262	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	you know, whether it's lapel or,	no
3263	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	uh, headset microphone.	no
3264	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	And overlap or not. Yeah.	no
3265	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3266	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	And we can exclude - we don't need to recognize the	no
3267	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	De- th- that you did before.	no
3268	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I mean, in fact, we excluded them previously	no
3269	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah. So we want to do the same - same thing.	no
3270	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	from -	no
3271	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
3272	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K. So - Alright. So if we got a list	no
3273	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	of the,	no
3274	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	uh, segmentations for these five Meeting Recorder meetings, we could start,	no
3275	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	uh, the first two	no
3276	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
3277	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So, you could get those going while	no
3278	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Dave is, um, creating waveforms for the r- retraining the short male models.	no
3279	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3280	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right. O_K. O_K. And then -	no
3281	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K. So, do we w- also want to run	no
3282	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	that bottom experiment without	no
3283	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	retraining the short male models on his thing? Did you want that?	no
3284	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Or - ?	no
3285	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Um,	no
3286	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I - I agree that that would be an interesting thing to do, but I sort of regard it as secondary.	no
3287	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K. So, we'll save that.	no
3288	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So if there's sort of machines sitting around and people sitting around and they're waiting for	no
3289	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	other things to finish, then sure. But -	no
3290	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Uh, Chuck had been asking about that earlier as kind of a control to know, um -	no
3291	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Cuz, I mean, you could imagine a fantasy in which you said that Dave's processing	no
3292	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	made the, uh, far microphone like the near microphone. In which case	no
3293	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
3294	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	you shouldn't have to actually retrain.	no
3295	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	But it's - it's not really true. It's - it's sort of fantasy. It does - it does muck up the data in - in some funny ways. And so,	no
3296	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
3297	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Well, i- it -	no
3298	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	But -	no
3299	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Well, on a more basic level, also, it means that	no
3300	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	that	no
3301	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
3302	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So, it's hard to know -	no
3303	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	It involves retraining and it involves a -	no
3304	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
3305	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Uh, that's right.	no
3306	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I mean the other thing which - which it might come in -	no
3307	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	to is if there was some	no
3308	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	in the retraining.	no
3309	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I mean, maybe you'd just have some mechanical thing we do wrong.	no
3310	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
3311	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Uh, that, uh - since Dave's experience was that	no
3312	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
3313	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	it didn't help as	no
3314	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	that we would hopefully see that.	no
3315	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
3316	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So, that - that's - that's true.	no
3317	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I- i-	no
3318	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So when you used	no
3319	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	original - the original models, and you just process	no
3320	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	the test set in this way, d- do you get any -	no
3321	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	do you get decent performance or not?	no
3322	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I - I - I think, um,	no
3323	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	for the far-mike H_T_K system I was using,	no
3324	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
3325	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	it did help somewhat. I could re-check that. But it was such a bad baseline	no
3326	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mmm.	no
3327	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	that	no
3328	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I don't know what that means.	no
3329	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
3330	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
3331	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K.	no
3332	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Cuz the baseline word error rate was around forty percent on digits.	no
3333	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
3334	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	On the far-field?	no
3335	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
3336	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
3337	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	well, the first -	no
3338	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	the one that already has a	no
3339	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	cross there. We need to re-do that with small models.	no
3340	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
3341	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3342	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	And then, have to ask, um,	no
3343	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I guess, Don	no
3344	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	to, uh, cut the,	no
3345	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	um,	no
3346	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	cut the segments for the sh-	no
3347	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	for the tis- distant mike.	no
3348	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Uh, uh - that's -	no
3349	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So we would be using the	no
3350	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	for each - fo- for everything?	no
3351	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
3352	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3353	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K.	no
3354	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So.	no
3355	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	No, no. We would use the same segmentations, but he needs to extract -	no
3356	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	extract the wavef- form segments from a different channel.	no
3357	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Oh. O_K.	no
3358	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Got it.	no
3359	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
3360	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So when you said you were gonna start that top one, were you gonna use the new segmentations?	no
3361	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
3362	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Um -	no
3363	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3364	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K.	no
3365	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	If - assuming that	no
3366	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	the performance	no
3367	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	turns out to be	no
3368	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	with the old experiments	no
3369	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right. O_K.	no
3370	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	and the old segmentations.	no
3371	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Now there's the issue of -	no
3372	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Oh, O_K. So there's the issue of speaker normalization. So,	no
3373	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	with the distant microphone you wouldn't know which speaker	no
3374	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	is talking.	no
3375	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right?	no
3376	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Can we - ?	no
3377	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	We - we talked about this before.	no
3378	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I think what we were saying was that, um,	no
3379	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	the very fact that in both cases we're ignoring the overlap section	no
3380	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	means that, um,	no
3381	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	uh,	no
3382	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	we're to some extent finessing that. So,	no
3383	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	um, I think,	no
3384	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	for the purposes of	no
3385	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	uh, what the effect of the far-field microphone is, we should do the same to both.	no
3386	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
3387	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I see. So you want to cheat?	no
3388	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I mean -	no
3389	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	We want to i- incorporate	no
3390	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	certain data that would not be available during final tests,	no
3391	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	uh, under a - a full fair test of it, much as we are in the - all the numbers that we have so far.	no
3392	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K. So we assume - we assume knowledge of the speakers as -	no
3393	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Oops.	no
3394	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	as, um -	no
3395	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	in a way that's compatible with the close-talking	no
3396	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3397	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	test set. O_K.	no
3398	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	We - we simply wanna determine what's the difference in performance due to being distant versus close.	no
3399	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Oh, O_K.	no
3400	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So,	no
3401	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	does that mean you turn off speaker normalization when you run it? Or you just let it do what it would do, an- ?	no
3402	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	No. It means - No. It just means	no
3403	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	you - you group together	no
3404	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	the segments	no
3405	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	to one speaker,	no
3406	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	and - and treat -	no
3407	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I mean to a lesser extent you had that same magic the other way, too, because	no
3408	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	you have leakage into other microphones. Right?	no
3409	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	But, it's just you're using the fact that	no
3410	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
3411	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	this is	no
3412	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	where this person is. Right?	no
3413	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
3414	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So.	no
3415	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	But, um -	no
3416	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	It's just easier to do.	no
3417	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Well, in the new test, actually, that's not true.	no
3418	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So -	no
3419	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Again, if this - if these new segmentations work O_K,	no
3420	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3421	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	then we - then it's a fair -	no
3422	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	it's a completely fair	no
3423	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So, how do you determine what you use to group together to be a - a - ?	no
3424	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	You group together all the data coming in through one channel	no
3425	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	and where	no
3426	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	has determined that there is speech.	no
3427	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	And that speech is - is deemed to	no
3428	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So if you get some cross-talk from another microphone, then you just	no
3429	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	process this - it as if it were from that speaker.	no
3430	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	The only other alternative would be to turn off speaker adaptation in both.	no
3431	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Well, that's more of a problem.	no
3432	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I mean, because it's - You can just pretend it's some kind of	no
3433	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	gene- I mean you can	no
3434	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	but then you're gonna get results that are worse on account of not doing proper	no
3435	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
3436	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	speaker normalization and you're gonna have -	no
3437	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So, you could certainly do	no
3438	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	which is what we do, say, in a Broadcast News system, where you don't	no
3439	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	But that would be another processing step that	no
3440	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I'm - I would have to	no
3441	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Hmm.	no
3442	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So I agree with you. We should -	no
3443	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	we should, uh, do the -	no
3444	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	you know, this sort of cheating experiment.	no
3445	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K.	no
3446	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah. An- and e- so that will tell us	no
3447	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	The - the other	no
3448	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	difference that we'd have to take care of is that, uh - yeah, we - we don't have	no
3449	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	is particular to a	no
3450	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	another, uh, issue, too.	no
3451	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
3452	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	But, it - it - I could be wrong, but it seems to me that - that	no
3453	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	the speaker - the -	no
3454	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	the level of degradation that you get	no
3455	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	from	no
3456	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	having the distant mike in a normal acoustic	no
3457	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Hmm.	no
3458	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	is much greater than what you get from, say, not applying speaker adaptation or applying speaker adaptation.	no
3459	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I think that the -	no
3460	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I mean, we'll see. But - but, I think that the kind of gains that we've seen from speaker adaptation	no
3461	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	on Hub-five sort of things are like a few percent. Right? And -	no
3462	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	It's not just speaker adaptation. It's the whole	no
3463	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	norm- feature normalization process. I- it's spea- uh, all that is speaker-based.	no
3464	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	You know, so we -	no
3465	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So, in	no
3466	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	um -	no
3467	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Y- you know, d- d- b- the most important, of course, is the	no
3468	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	And that -	no
3469	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3470	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I don't know if we - we never really - I don't remember,	no
3471	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	because it's so far -	no
3472	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	s- so long ago that we didn't do that on a per speaker basis, but -	no
3473	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	It doesn't make that much difference, I think. I would doubt that it would be a huge amount of difference for that.	no
3474	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So, I mean, I - I think that	no
3475	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I think the	no
3476	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	And, uh, so what's different about this processing is just that we're doing it	no
3477	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	at a much longer time	no
3478	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Hmm.	no
3479	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mmm.	no
3480	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	But -	no
3481	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Um -	no
3482	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	A- and by the way,	no
3483	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	What wo-	no
3484	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	it's - actually we're -	no
3485	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	we're already - If we use the same segmentations that we use for the close-talking microphone, then	no
3486	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	the segmentations	no
3487	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	cross	no
3488	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	That's right.	no
3489	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	correlate them, so	no
3490	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	there's no	no
3491	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3492	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
3493	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Uh, I- I think also for the log spectral mean subtraction,	no
3494	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3495	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	uh, we wanna know which speaker's talking when, cuz we wanna	no
3496	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	chain together the audio from one particular speaker to calculate the mean and subtract it, and we don't -	no
3497	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3498	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
3499	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
3500	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K.	no
3501	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	But, um,	no
3502	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I also think that a- again once we got into it, that, um, using some kind of clustering would probably	no
3503	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	work reasonably well there, too.	no
3504	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Certainly for the - the two microphone case, which we're not gonna mess with because it's another whole	no
3505	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	deal with the low-quality microphones, um,	no
3506	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	we ought to be able to at least tell	no
3507	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	that it	no
3508	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Hmm.	no
3509	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So we ought to be able to use	no
3510	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	um, as well.	no
3511	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	But, I think we might	no
3512	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	be able to do not too bad a job of	no
3513	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	separating out	no
3514	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	sp-	no
3515	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	uh, segments that appear to come from a single speaker	no
3516	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	both in terms of s- acoustic similarity and in terms of direction.	no
3517	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So, I mean - But that's another research thing to do and	no
3518	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Well, I mean, I'm - I'm leaving for	no
3519	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	the New Orleans meeting, uh, next	no
3520	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
3521	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	and, um,	no
3522	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	some results at least a day or two before that, so that I could	no
3523	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
3524	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	figure out what I wanted to say about it.	no
3525	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Oh, we'll call you when you get there.	no
3526	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	You'll have email. Right?	no
3527	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3528	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Uh, not to mention that - that, uh, Mari's putting together this report	no
3529	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mmm.	no
3530	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	next week, too, you know. So -	no
3531	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Uh,	no
3532	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	what we were	no
3533	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mmm.	no
3534	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	and, uh -	no
3535	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	uh, maybe, you know, we could -	no
3536	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	by the end of the weekend, we could have the top one, and - and then	no
3537	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	early next week, do these.	no
3538	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mmm.	no
3539	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	If we had enough machines, maybe do	no
3540	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
3541	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So that by the middle of the week we had s- had some kind of result.	no
3542	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I mean, it's - it's one of these	no
3543	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	it, uh -	no
3544	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mmm.	no
3545	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	might - might not	no
3546	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	But, uh, f- figured I may as well ask for it.	no
3547	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K.	no
3548	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I'll ask -	no
3549	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So - ?	no
3550	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	The other thing is, um -	no
3551	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	and I'll ask Don which is easier to process in terms of creating these -	no
3552	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	the - the test data for the far -	no
3553	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	far microphone.	no
3554	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	If - if it turns out that for some reason it's easier for him to	no
3555	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	use the old - um,	no
3556	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	the - the - the old, uh,	no
3557	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Segmentation?	no
3558	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	then we'll just use that, I figure.	no
3559	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
3560	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Um -	no
3561	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	S- So,	no
3562	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	um.	no
3563	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I don't want you to have to be burdened with doing a lot of stuff. What - what can I do to - ?	no
3564	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Y- y- you said it would be easy for you to do that	no
3565	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	uh, channel F_?	no
3566	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
3567	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Um -	no
3568	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I mean, I can certainly help with, uh, retraining	no
3569	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
3570	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	uh, once we have the new data.	no
3571	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	You have models of short males?	no
3572	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3573	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Um -	no
3574	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right. Uh, let's see. The - the	no
3575	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	you could run the,	no
3576	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	um,	no
3577	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	you c- Basically, once	no
3578	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	the, um,	no
3579	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	The top one is done. I c-	no
3580	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	whe- the top - the top one's done, you could easily re-run the whole set of experiments.	no
3581	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I can re-do the	no
3582	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
3583	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Uh, I mean,	no
3584	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	manage the jobs and so forth, uh -	no
3585	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah. Sure.	no
3586	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Um, that's all -	no
3587	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah, the -	no
3588	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	the bottom one would b- just be a matter of pointing it at a new set of files and kicking it off, so that would be re-	no
3589	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I mean, th- not the	no
3590	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
3591	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	would be really easy once you've got the top one going. I could do that.	no
3592	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3593	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
3594	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K. So I guess I just need to	no
3595	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	get Don to,	no
3596	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	uh -	no
3597	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right. So, somehow the -	no
3598	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Assuming he uses the new naming scheme, then	no
3599	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	he should call	no
3600	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	the - so, the waveform names have the, you know, meeting - meeting I_D,	no
3601	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	and the	no
3602	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	and the,	no
3603	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	um -	no
3604	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I guess, the channel and the microphone and the speaker,	no
3605	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	um,	no
3606	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	speaker - some- something that identifies the speaker.	no
3607	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
3608	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	To keep it the same but j- just change them all to channel F_?	no
3609	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Exactly. So, uh - well, you still need to be able to distinguish the different speakers.	no
3610	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	That's the key point. Because, if we wanna do what we just discussed - So -	no
3611	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right. Right.	no
3612	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3613	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Uh, uh, the - the best - the easiest way to do that would be to just take -	no
3614	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	You know, you make the channel be channel F_,	no
3615	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	but then keep the speaker names the same as they would be in the old -	no
3616	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3617	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K.	no
3618	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K.	no
3619	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	in the close-talking,	no
3620	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	uh,	no
3621	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	version.	no
3622	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K. And so that's something that Don would do - right? - when he creates these.	no
3623	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right. Exactly.	no
3624	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K. O_K.	no
3625	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So will you talk to him about that, or do you want me to talk to him?	no
3626	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I, uh, I - I can talk to him.	no
3627	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K.	no
3628	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	And then the bottom	no
3629	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Uh -	no
3630	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	That will just be a copy of the one above it, except for	no
3631	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Well, we also have to mean subtract the test data.	no
3632	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	from training.	no
3633	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Ah. O_K.	no
3634	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So, we need to run - ?	no
3635	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K.	no
3636	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Well, once we have the new, uh -	no
3637	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Well, once I do that, uh, second experiment, we'll have the,	no
3638	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	um,	no
3639	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K.	no
3640	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	And there's, um,	no
3641	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	S- so the way this means subtraction expects to work, is it expects	no
3642	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	to have, um,	no
3643	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	this continuous stream of audio data	no
3644	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	from a particular speaker to operate on. And it goes along it with this sliding window,	no
3645	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	calculating the mean using the data in the window,	no
3646	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	and then subtracting that.	no
3647	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So, do you create this continuous stream from the individual utterance files?	no
3648	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I mean, uh -	no
3649	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	That's - that's how I've been doing it, just by concatenating files together.	no
3650	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Hmm.	no
3651	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Um, and if these files - and the- since they're individual utterance files, um,	no
3652	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	s- long silence periods are removed, which is a	no
3653	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Because this method might estimate the mean badly, if it had to face long silence periods.	no
3654	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	But that	no
3655	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I need	no
3656	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	um, of these	no
3657	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3658	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Hmm.	no
3659	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	and then	no
3660	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	And then I can get rid of the	no
3661	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	But st- while I'm doing the processing, I'll nee- I need twice as much disk space.	no
3662	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K. I'm gonna - I'll check with, um,	no
3663	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Markham, and see what happened with the - the disks.	no
3664	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	He went to put those on a couple of weeks ago and something -	no
3665	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I think	no
3666	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I think, che- check with Dave. Yeah.	no
3667	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Oh, O_K. I'll ask David, then.	no
3668	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3669	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	You haven't seen new disks pop up, have you?	no
3670	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Nope.	no
3671	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I was wondering	no
3672	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K.	no
3673	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3674	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Well, they grow them on trees now.	no
3675	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Well, he went to put	no
3676	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Just, you	no
3677	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3678	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	He went to put	no
3679	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3680	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	"And he sent around a note saying ""Oh, uh,"	no
3681	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah. Something w- went wrong.	no
3682	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	it didn't work, and	no
3683	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	"we'll have to schedule another time."" And then,"	no
3684	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	didn't see - nothing happened.	no
3685	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Nothing happened. No? Yeah.	no
3686	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So -	no
3687	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I'll check with David about that.	no
3688	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K.	no
3689	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3690	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Cuz we still all have tha- the - that other one going, which is the, uh - the Macrophone	no
3691	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right, an- and -	no
3692	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	training.	no
3693	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So - so, Andreas, um,	no
3694	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm?	no
3695	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	in U_ doctor speech data S_R_I Hub-five, there's this, uh, Hub-five training set. Now, is that the long training set there?	no
3696	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mmm.	no
3697	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
3698	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
3699	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	That's everything. Yeah, so -	no
3700	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K.	no
3701	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So, I can give you a list of the short	no
3702	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K. I th- I think you already did, actually.	no
3703	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So you can -	no
3704	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Oh, O_K.	no
3705	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K. And so, say the	no
3706	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	a	no
3707	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	That's right.	no
3708	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K. So - so, um - when you - You did some T_I-digits t- t- experiments training on Macrophone.	no
3709	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3710	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Um.	no
3711	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	But that's not necessarily any	no
3712	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	set. It's not a - it's not a	no
3713	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Um -	no
3714	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Wel- No, it is.	no
3715	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Th- the -	no
3716	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Sorry. Um.	no
3717	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Can you repeat the question?	no
3718	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Uh, whe- when you trained on Macrophone, um, to do those digits experiments, did you use the	no
3719	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	No. Only the portion that was in the Hub-five training set.	no
3720	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Oh. O_K.	no
3721	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	That was in the Hub-five	no
3722	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Well, the Hub-five small training set contains	no
3723	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	as much Macrophone as the large training set,	no
3724	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yes.	no
3725	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	for historical reasons. Yeah.	no
3726	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K- O_K. So -	no
3727	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Um -	no
3728	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So, do you have that processed there, then - right?	no
3729	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Because you already did - did y- didn't you already do that experiment?	no
3730	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I-	no
3731	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I - I got confused, cuz I thought - I thought you were using	no
3732	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
3733	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	No.	no
3734	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Um. O_K.	no
3735	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Well, if - if - if I just need to use that subset, I - I can get it processed. I actually	no
3736	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I think I got f-	no
3737	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	into it before, and then I thought I was doing the wrong thing and I stopped. And it shouldn- it shouldn't take that long to do.	no
3738	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mmm.	no
3739	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K.	no
3740	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K.	no
3741	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	And you need only the males. So.	no
3742	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Oh, O_K.	no
3743	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So, basically, Dave, so y- for you to get your processing going, you need the list of the, uh, wave-	no
3744	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Well, I guess it'll dep- you'll - you'll - we'll need to get the segmentations.	no
3745	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3746	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Figure out whether we're using the new or the old	no
3747	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Hmm.	no
3748	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	And then, uh,	no
3749	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	from that you need the - from the segmentations you'll have the list of	no
3750	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	wavefiles that the short,	no
3751	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	uh, set is trained on.	no
3752	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	And then	no
3753	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	you'll need disk space. And once you've got	no
3754	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3755	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K.	no
3756	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Does this - th- this - ?	no
3757	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	It- it's sort of - f- f-	no
3758	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	not very nice to use the small training set for another reason, which is that the	no
3759	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	you also are losing on -	no
3760	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Again,	no
3761	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	because you don't use	no
3762	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So, the normalizations you compute for your training speakers will be,	no
3763	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	uh, crummier	no
3764	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So,	no
3765	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	um, I have to - So, to make it really a	no
3766	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	uh, I have to	no
3767	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	use short models that were trained on	no
3768	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	set.	no
3769	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Which is, uh -	no
3770	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Do you have this, uh - ?	no
3771	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I have to check. In any case, I could retrain short models within	no
3772	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	a few hours actually at - if I use	no
3773	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	machines at S_R_I.	no
3774	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I wonder about that, though.	no
3775	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Hmm?	no
3776	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I mean, because	no
3777	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	And there - we're not really making any	no
3778	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3779	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So as long as we're not using any testing data from -	no
3780	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	No. But the thing is, if - if we used -	no
3781	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	if we used the whole training set for normalizations,	no
3782	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3783	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	then	no
3784	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	which - That's a - that's one bottleneck, for us right, in terms of get-	no
3785	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Oh, you mean for - for	no
3786	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3787	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Oh, oh, oh. I'm sorry.	no
3788	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
3789	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So, you wanna do the exact same thing, or else	no
3790	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
3791	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3792	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So.	no
3793	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	It doesn't make - I don't think it makes	no
3794	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	little detail that	no
3795	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
3796	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	if you can	no
3797	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	take care of that, then you should.	no
3798	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I - I think I have - I have the models, I have -	no
3799	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I have, um -	no
3800	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	let's see, um -	no
3801	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah. And if not I can retrain	no
3802	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Oh, there's - there's one other issue,	no
3803	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	quickly.	no
3804	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	uh, and that is that Dave throws out	no
3805	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	speakers that have less than twelve seconds of training data.	no
3806	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	And he said there were a few in the Macrophone set like that.	no
3807	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So, do we need to wait	no
3808	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	to find out who he's gonna throw out, so that we create	no
3809	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	a new set of short models that don't include those speakers?	no
3810	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Uh -	no
3811	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Say this again?	no
3812	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Sorry I missed it.	no
3813	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So i- in -	no
3814	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Th- the problem is that if we proceed like we just described,	no
3815	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	um,	no
3816	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	when he goes to	no
3817	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	m- um,	no
3818	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	create the new s- training	no
3819	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So the t- two training sets won't be identical.	no
3820	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3821	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	He throws out some speakers that are - that are very small.	no
3822	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah. Have just a little bit.	no
3823	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah. I don't think it'll make a - matter.	no
3824	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah. I think there was only a few	no
3825	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K.	no
3826	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	we thought to be the case. Righ- ?	no
3827	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	In fact, I thought about throwing those out too, because	no
3828	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	when I heard how little speech there was for some of them, I thought they can only hurt your models, because they're -	no
3829	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	again their normalizations will be all -	no
3830	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3831	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
3832	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	all - all over the map, and	no
3833	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	you won't get	no
3834	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	very - very clean	no
3835	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	models from them, anyhow. So.	no
3836	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So you think it's O_K, then?	no
3837	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah. In fact,	no
3838	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	if - if you wanna do this, uh, to speed things up,	no
3839	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	um,	no
3840	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	you - we can leave out the Macrophone data altogether.	no
3841	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	That hurt -	no
3842	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Actually. Oh, no. Sorry.	no
3843	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Not in the short. Then you have too little data. O_K.	no
3844	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Sorry. Forget that.	no
3845	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Um,	no
3846	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	When you use - when you go to the large training set,	no
3847	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	then	no
3848	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	actually sometimes	no
3849	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	it- it's just not relevant to the -	no
3850	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	It's read.	no
3851	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	to the meeting and - or to	no
3852	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah. Leave it out, and -	no
3853	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Um, in the event that I retrain the short models,	no
3854	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	um, why don't you give me a list of the files that you throw out, and I - I'll throw them out, too.	no
3855	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
3856	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	And then we have complete -	no
3857	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	completely	no
3858	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	We sh-	no
3859	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	M- Right.	no
3860	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	A- actually you should be able to figure out,	no
3861	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Dave, right, once you know the segmentations,	no
3862	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
3863	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	uh, who you're going to -	no
3864	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	which speakers will get left out, even before you run your processing. Right?	no
3865	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	The segmentations?	no
3866	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah. The segmentations from Don?	no
3867	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	But th- the segmentations are only -	no
3868	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Once we - ?	no
3869	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Oh.	no
3870	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	they only affect the	no
3871	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	We're talking about the	no
3872	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Ah. Right, right, right, right, right.	no
3873	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	No. The training set he could go through right now, and see how - how long the -	no
3874	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right. But I'm just wondering how long it will take to get	no
3875	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	that information.	no
3876	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Um -	no
3877	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	He already has the in- you already have the information.	no
3878	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I - I have i- I have it for -	no
3879	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	for Macrophone, um,	no
3880	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	already, I	no
3881	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
3882	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K.	no

3885	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K.	no
3886	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	At that one?	no
3887	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Uh -	no
3888	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Been looking at synthesizers?	no
3889	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Synthesizers?	no
3890	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	You were looking at Festival. Yeah.	no
3891	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah, yeah. I was doing something for	no
3892	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Robert has taken his laptop t- back to Germany so we needed a new synthesis machine.	no
3893	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	And we have now a SUN workstation in the library,	no
3894	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	which does the synthesis and the Festival speech s- s- system is	no
3895	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Sorry, Robert did what?	no
3896	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Robert took what?	no
3897	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	His laptop where, uh -	no
3898	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	which we used for the SmartKom data collection, for the synthesis.	no
3899	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Uh-huh.	no
3900	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	And so he took it to Germany	no
3901	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	and	no
3902	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Oh.	no
3903	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Is he gone now?	no
3904	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	No. He's just gone to a SmartKom workshop.	no

3906	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Oh, oh. Oh, O_K.	no
3907	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	And so, we have now the SUN in the library which can do that.	no
3908	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Ah.	no
3909	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	And I looked into the ts- F_zero thing and talked to -	no
3910	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	to Liz, and it seems that	no
3911	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	it's quite	no
3912	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	s-	no
3913	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	what she wants, but we'll	no
3914	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	have to think about the - the	no
3915	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
3916	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	This was a business about, uh,	no
3917	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	um,	no

3919	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
3920	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	And so, uh, we're just gonna	no
3921	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	use a pitch detector, drive a synthesizer, and	no
3922	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	since it doesn't have a hook in it for, uh, modifying energy, we'll have a little	no
3923	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	box at the output that'll modify the energy.	no
3924	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So -	no
3925	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Hmm.	no
3926	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Hmm.	no

3930	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Are you - are you interfacing to that thing with the C_plus-plus routines?	no
3931	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Or are you - is there another interface that you use?	no
3932	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	For w- for Festival?	no
3933	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3934	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Uh, you can just	no
3935	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Basically from the command line, and the- defining the phones, whatever you want to have synthesized, and	no
3936	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Oh.	no
3937	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	And it saves it in a -	no
3938	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	give the F_zero targets, and then ts-	no
3939	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	get - gives out a - a waveform, and I - I want to manipulate the - the waveform, then.	no

4026	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah, both channels.	no
4027	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Oh, hang on.	no
4028	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4029	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah, it is at the	no

4031	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yep.	no
4032	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	O_K.	no
4033	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	This is -	no
4034	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Although the gain	no
4035	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So for the um	no
4036	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Mm-hmm.	no
4037	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Hang on, let's - let's -	no
4038	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I have extracted these -	no
4039	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	O_K let's just - let's just name the microphones.	no
4040	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	O_K.	no
4041	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So I'm speaking on the	no
4042	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	O_K.	no
4043	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right and I'm now talking on microphone number two,	no
4044	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	uh, the	no
4045	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4046	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Um, I have no idea which one I'm - I'm on. Oh one! Oh, I'm number one.	no
4047	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I'm -	no
4048	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	You're on one.	no
4049	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Absolutely.	no

4051	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yes.	no
4052	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	O_K so this is - this is the P_Z_M nearest the eh	no
4053	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	eh the	no
4054	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Actually, i-	no
4055	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Then	no
4056	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	This further down the table.	no
4057	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	And this - this one is right at the end of the table, O_K?	no
4058	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	And then we've got the uh -	no
4059	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	This is the	no
4060	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	this would be the right side.	no
4061	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I think listening to this is gonna be like watching somebody's home movies.	no
4062	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yes, it'll be pretty horrible.	no
4063	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah, O_K.	no
4064	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Very exciting.	yes
4065	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So, what I have on these forms here is for the read numbers - read digits tasks and it's extracted directly from Aurora	no
4066	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So what I was thinking is we could start just by filling it out and then reading - reading the numbers on the form.	no
4067	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	O_K, what do we do with the stuff on top?	no
4068	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Fill it out.	no
4069	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	But I -	no
4070	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Do we say it after we -	no
4071	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	No. Just write it down.	no
4072	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	No, you don't need to.	no
4073	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	What are we - why are we writing it down?	no
4074	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So that	no
4075	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Oh.	no
4076	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	O_K	no
4077	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	That's good. So I don't need to fill that out right now. So maybe we should just say it.	no
4078	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	W-	no
4079	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	O_K.	no
4080	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Why don't you want to fill it out right now? Just so that -	no
4081	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So then we're not spending the time writing it out. So that we're spending the time talking.	no
4082	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well, how about	no
4083	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I'm just uh concerned about a bunch of dead time while we all sit here and fill out the things.	no
4084	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	O_K.	no
4085	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah, yeah, yeah.	no
4086	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right?	no
4087	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	And so you have to be sure to pause	no
4088	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right.	no
4089	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	O_K, so this is Morgan. I'm going to read some numbers now.	no

4146	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	The equip- Me and Adam went through it yesterday, just looked at everything. But it's all kind of	no
4147	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	And, um -	no
4148	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I mean, ev- eventually we'll want to like	no
4149	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	running the program.	no
4150	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	tape that over and run them up through the center so that wires aren't - aren't - people aren't tripping over the wires and so on.	no
4151	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right.	no
4152	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Are we gonna - I mean, is it gonna be over there, or is it gonna be in there?	no
4153	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Um, it's - it's gonna b- it's - for reasons - because of the microphones runs we want that chunk	no
4154	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	But there's -	no
4155	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	and then that's -	no
4156	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	And the idea is that this gets replaced by a cabinet with doors, so that -	no
4157	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So that's what's gonna happen.	no
4158	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right.	no
4159	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	That's	no
4160	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Do we have like a	no
4161	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	We need to	no
4162	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well, I -	no
4163	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I -	no
4164	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah!	no
4165	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Oh - I mean, I don't know. Did we s- did we spend our - the budget already that we had?	no
4166	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4167	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Uh, how much	no
4168	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Um.	no
4169	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I don't know. A cabinet is probably going to cost	no
4170	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I mean.	no
4171	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah, I mean, you know, we - we can spend under a thousand dollars or something without - without worrying about it.	no
4172	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4173	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I mean, I think - um	no
4174	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4175	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	you know.	no
4176	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well, I think our intention at this point is when we're not using it to record a meeting we'll coil them all up and put them under	no
4177	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4178	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So.	no
4179	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	But,	no
4180	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah, and there's also the minor matter, it'd be	no
4181	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right. Not have it -	no
4182	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	and then be able to see uh,	no
4183	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4184	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	you know,	no
4185	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	less important than doing what we're doing right now but -	no
4186	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4187	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So.	no
4188	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I mean	no
4189	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	which is um	no
4190	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	ultimately we're gonna - well the idea is to have	no
4191	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	any number of these wired headsets, but	no
4192	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	there's this amplification problem.	no
4193	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I built this thing, it's - that's - it's very noisy. We're actually recording - I'm -	no
4194	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	it's - it's designed to be used for the - for the desktop	no
4195	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	But I'm using - running that through my uh	no
4196	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well, we	no
4197	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4198	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	It's just - it eh	no
4199	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	You see how clumsy this is right? I have to use these batteries to bias them.	no
4200	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	And I'm only get two channels and there're a bunch of -	no
4201	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	There are like three connectors in the circuit.	no
4202	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	The thing is, like,	no
4203	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	it's -	no
4204	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	it's not s- it's not that the thing doesn't	no
4205	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So it seemed like it was a good idea to	no
4206	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	And I'm	no
4207	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4208	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	build it better so it doesn't have such noise, but	no
4209	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	it's kind of	no
4210	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well, ultimately we're gonna need to build one anyway.	no
4211	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Are we?	no
4212	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Sure. Because we- we're gonna have to put it in a P_D_A.	no
4213	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well, we	no
4214	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well.	no
4215	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right? If we have microphones in a P_D_A it's gonna need	no
4216	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	bias and	no
4217	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I guess I'd sort of figured that - that Jim would do that at some	no
4218	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Mm-hmm.	no
4219	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4220	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well n-	no
4221	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4222	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Jim is busy at the moment. That's the	no
4223	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	But um - but he hasn't had time.	no
4224	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4225	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	O_K.	no
4226	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well	no
4227	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	If it's	no
4228	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4229	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4230	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	And then - and then	no
4231	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Because there may be other considerations	no
4232	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	our getting some experience with this may help to determine	no
4233	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Mm-hmm.	no
4234	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right.	no
4235	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So.	no
4236	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	There was uh a statement made	no
4237	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	uh	no
4238	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	which I don't think is	no
4239	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	there was a statement made at the uh DARPA Communicator meeting I was at recently	no
4240	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	that um	no
4241	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	microphone - multiple microphones	no
4242	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Oh!	no
4243	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4244	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	You - you mean for noise cancelling, or - ?	no
4245	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	for nois- noise cancelling.	no
4246	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Um,	no
4247	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	my counter argument is - is an - uh uh um, a white rat.	no
4248	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	uh, which	no
4249	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Oh.	no
4250	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Um but -	no
4251	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	O_K.	no
4252	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4253	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Do they mean	no
4254	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I think -	no
4255	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	But.	no
4256	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Oh, I see.	no
4257	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	If the f- if the wavefronts are	no
4258	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I	no
4259	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right. But I think that if - my point is I guess if you - if you have a um -	no
4260	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	a uh s- a	no
4261	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4262	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	and you do something	no
4263	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	there clearly are ways	no
4264	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4265	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah, yeah.	no
4266	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right, right, right. I mean the - um	no
4267	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	The - the weird thing is that actually	no
4268	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	the - the underwater guys do this stuff which is	no
4269	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	And it actually means that you should get the microphones as close together as possible.	no
4270	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Rather than trying to get them far apart so you can get	no
4271	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	And	no
4272	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4273	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well, there are various points in meeting where people were making uh uh	no
4274	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	this was one of them that	no
4275	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Um but I - I - I - what I take it to mean is doing - doing the dumb thing	no
4276	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4277	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	uh with two microphones would be very difficult to get too much out of it but	no
4278	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4279	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I think it will be	no
4280	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So I - I still think it's potentially	no
4281	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Hmm.	no
4282	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	"wherever, that there may well be reviewers who will say, ""well everyone"	no
4283	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4284	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Do they believe you can get speaker location out of it? Cuz that's - that's one way we could sneak it in.	no
4285	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Uh, that is an interesting point.	no
4286	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah. Certainly you can	no
4287	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4288	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well we could -	no
4289	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	get some -	no
4290	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I mean. By the time -	no
4291	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4292	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well.	no
4293	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Hopefully.	no
4294	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Oh, you mean for location?	no
4295	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4296	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	O_K. Depends on who's working on it.	no
4297	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	we- we're getting some right	no
4298	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah, right.	no
4299	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right. Right. But I mean.	no
4300	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well someone- someone might be interested in - in it.	no
4301	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Oh that's uh - I was just thinking one thing we may wanna do is put the fake P_D_A right in front of someone	no
4302	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	instead of in the middle of the table like we have it now.	no
4303	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	on the thought that - my vision of it is you know each of us will have our little P_D_A in front of us	no
4304	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4305	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4306	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	But on the other hand,	no
4307	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	suppose that uh, you're the only one uh who is	no
4308	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	No, and I don't need to meet with	no
4309	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	and - and -	no
4310	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	and therefore	no
4311	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Mm-hmm.	no
4312	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well.	no
4313	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yep, yep.	no
4314	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	and then we can have actual	no
4315	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4316	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well, I	no
4317	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I mean, I think at	no
4318	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Mm-hmm.	no
4319	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right.	no
4320	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Because uh one of the th- one of the fantasies that was at least fun to	no
4321	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	uh O_K maybe you th-	no
4322	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	you're -	no
4323	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	the range of things you can do with multiple microphones is limited if they're a few inches apart,	no
4324	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4325	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	And you know we have this - this idea of the handshake	no
4326	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4327	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right.	no
4328	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right, right.	no
4329	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4330	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	That's right.	no
4331	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Three, right?	no
4332	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4333	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah	no
4334	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah, but -	no
4335	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	We're not, even, you know	no
4336	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	We - we may be	no
4337	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So it's - That's just how it is.	no
4338	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well, I'm	no
4339	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well, I know. Well, that's true. I mean.	no
4340	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Except I s- got a P_D_A way before - Well I was doing hand- I was doing wearable computers at Boeing, so I guess I sort of count.	no
4341	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	O_K.	no
4342	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So uh - so where are we	no
4343	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	uh We're doing this recording so we show	no
4344	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right.	no
4345	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	uh there's	no
4346	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Mm-hmm.	no
4347	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Uh.	no
4348	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well we've got - we've got - Right now we could have two more people on wireless,	no
4349	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Mm-hmm.	no
4350	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So we	no
4351	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well.	no
4352	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Five with wireless.	no
4353	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4354	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Nine.	no
4355	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4356	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4357	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	and four with	no
4358	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Um, we don't have	no
4359	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah. We have the um - the ones we've been using, the ones we got for the P_C.	no
4360	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Oh, O_K so we just have to c-	no
4361	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah, yeah. I think we have three of those.	no
4362	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Mm-hmm.	no
4363	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Uh, there's one in my office. So.	no
4364	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right, right.	no
4365	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	O_K.	no
4366	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So, we'll just have to see if that works.	no
4367	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So a little bit of futzing, there's the issue about a cabinet, we might want to change some pre-amps.	no
4368	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4369	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So we can do some more recordings but there's - there's a little - little bit of ramp up	no
4370	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah, yeah.	yes
4371	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right and also I would like to work out some of the	no
4372	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	um, you know, we're gonna want to resample and con- and bring them over to another machine	no
4373	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4374	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4375	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4376	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	and uh	no
4377	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4378	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah we were talking about that a little bit over coffee today, that - that um	no
4379	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	uh if you	no
4380	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	if you used all - if you used all - no, if you used all the channels.	no
4381	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Per channel, or - ?	no
4382	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	We figured out that it was t- twelve gig-	no
4383	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	It was more than that.	no
4384	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I thought it was	no
4385	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	It couldn't be	no
4386	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Cuz no, we've only - no, I mean we've only got four gigabytes and that	no
4387	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	We said, four gigabytes	no
4388	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4389	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right. And then we - then we cut it in half.	no
4390	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	And then we cut in half,	no
4391	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	How'd you cut it?	no
4392	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	But -	no
4393	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	By s-	no
4394	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	O_K, so that's - so that's two gigabytes.	no
4395	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	And then -	no
4396	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well no I mean it's	no
4397	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	That's forty minutes	no
4398	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	uh four gigabytes for forty minutes.	no
4399	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right. But that's at forty four kilohertz with sixteen channels.	no
4400	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So, six gigabytes.	no
4401	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Forty-eight kilohertz,	no
4402	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So we can actually	no
4403	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So you can - right, so you can	no
4404	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4405	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So, hang on - so that would - O_K	no
4406	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I came out at the gig an hour,	no
4407	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well I think it's -	no
4408	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I think it's two gig an hour.	no
4409	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Is it two gig an hour? I'm off by an order of magni- That's alright. Order of two.	no
4410	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Cuz like, we don't -	no
4411	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	We could - we don't - we - we wouldn't use all the channels, necessarily.	no
4412	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Oh, we'll do the higher math later, maybe but it's - so it's - so maybe like a gig or two a - an hour, um but - um -	no
4413	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4414	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	O_K, that is a bit more than I thought.	no
4415	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	How much here would we have to reformat the drive in there	no
4416	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	to get some of the more space	no
4417	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4418	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	there's four gig on sc- on scratch and there's	no
4419	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I'm sure.	no
4420	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I just don't know enough about LINUX. How hard is it to	no
4421	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	It's a pain.	no
4422	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	It's a pain.	no
4423	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	"I mean, you know, because - cuz we've got data on ""user"", right? And then we'd have to"	no
4424	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Mm-hmm.	no
4425	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	back it all up and	no
4426	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah so this'll take some thought cuz we have - we -	no
4427	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	um	no
4428	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	If we are in fact gonna have forty or fifty hours at some point and we - we wanna ha- have part of our work be	no
4429	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	on feature extraction, it means that we need to have waveforms available	no
4430	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4431	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Hmm.	no
4432	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	"Right. So I've - I've already created a ""U_ - U_, doctor speech, data, M_R"" directory,"	no
4433	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	but there's not a lot of free space around.	no
4434	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	No.	no
4435	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Mm-hmm.	no
4436	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	on the drive that I think she's going to put it on um.	no
4437	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Mm-hmm.	no
4438	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	And so we need - we definitely need to go	no
4439	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4440	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	We don't need all - we don't necessarily need it all on-line. I mean it will be different subsets.	no
4441	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	That's true. I hadn't even thought about that,	no
4442	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	although it'd be kind of interesting.	no
4443	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4444	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	What would you do? I mean -	no
4445	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	You typically train - I mean you'd have fi- you'd have fifty hours we'd only use	no
4446	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	But it's kind of	no
4447	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	because basically,	no
4448	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	if we put them on C_Ds then each C_D will have	no
4449	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	and then when you want to build the P_files, you just want to get one of those files off each of	no
4450	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah, it's pretty horrible.	no
4451	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So what would we	no
4452	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah. Well, maybe	no
4453	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	O_K.	no
4454	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah so it might be	no
4455	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right? But it wouldn't be	no
4456	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well, although we wanted to get	no
4457	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	But that's a separate training.	no
4458	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right.	no
4459	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	No wait. More disk is better. Absolutely. I mean	no
4460	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4461	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	The thing is it's	no
4462	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4463	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So it's more of an issue of - of structuring it with uh the uh Sys Admin folks so we don't panic them and	no
4464	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	And back up.	no
4465	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	figuring out where it goes.	no
4466	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well, we don't - it doesn't need to be backed up.	no
4467	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right if - if we -	no
4468	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	if we burn it all on C_D-ROM,	no
4469	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right, then it doesn't need to be backed up.	no
4470	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	then,	no
4471	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	um, in fact, we could	no
4472	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	you know - we could throw away the Broadcast News stuff and put it on there or something like that.	no
4473	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah, we were talking about that. I'm not sure if anyone's	no
4474	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4475	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I think the only one using it has been Javier,	no
4476	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Somebody used it recently.	no
4477	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	but at this point I think it's - he's	no
4478	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4479	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	so if nobody else is doing	no
4480	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I'll send mail to speech local.	no
4481	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Pardon?	no
4482	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	How much space is that using up? Do you have any idea?	no
4483	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	It's uh twenty C_Ds, so that's twelve gigabytes.	no
4484	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So that would last us for a while.	no
4485	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah, couple hours!	no
4486	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well, anyway for this - this recording we're fine cuz we're only - we're only - how many mikes are we recording right now?	no
4487	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4488	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well, right now we don't have any choice. It r- still records all sixteen channels. It's just most of them are all zeroes.	no
4489	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So that - that's on our list too.	no
4490	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	O_K.	no
4491	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4492	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah, well that we can	no
4493	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	do something about.	no
4494	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yep.	no
4495	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	It's mostly a question of user interface. How do we - how do we specify which ones are on?	no
4496	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4497	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah, so we don't store any of our audio formats compressed in any way do we?	no
4498	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So these large sections when you guys aren't talking -	no
4499	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4500	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I think that's a good -	no
4501	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Run	no
4502	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Shorten.	no
4503	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Tony Robinson's	no
4504	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	O_K.	no
4505	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	What's	no
4506	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Um,	no
4507	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	it -	no
4508	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	it does	no
4509	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So I think it - On - on each block it'll -	no
4510	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Mm-hmm.	no
4511	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah, so, P_Z_Ms.	no
4512	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah, well.	no
4513	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4514	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah, it's something that - that we definitely need to look at with this.	no
4515	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Maybe we shouldn't've	no
4516	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well, it's O_K, it's only the first try. I - what I'm thinking is um	no
4517	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right.	no
4518	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah, so we might wanna see if maybe the low sixteen bits on the P_Z_Ms are better than the middle	no
4519	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4520	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I think -	no
4521	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Regardless, yeah.	no
4522	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right? Although you know it	no
4523	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	the -	no
4524	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	W- I was just noticing on the - on the - there's a view meter, software view meter and the P_Z_M gain is real low.	no
4525	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah, so I think	no
4526	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Mm-hmm.	no
4527	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4528	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yep.	no
4529	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4530	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah, I was	no
4531	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Oh, yeah!	no
4532	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Oh yeah!	no
4533	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah, that's right.	no
4534	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	These	no
4535	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4536	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	It's some sort of oversampling thing I imagine, right?	no
4537	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Didn't we already get that? Cuz you -	no
4538	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Oh, God knows. Yeah, yeah.	no
4539	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	you can't have	no
4540	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right.	no
4541	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right.	yes
4542	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right.	no
4543	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right the other - other thing	no
4544	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	You know, I assumed that we could just put a sound blaster in if we want sound output.	no
4545	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	That - that card - that machine's got sound - They've got a sound blaster built into it.	no
4546	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Oh, it's just not working.	no
4547	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I just - I just disabled it cuz I wanted to find out	no
4548	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	O_K.	no
4549	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah, that way we don't - we can't listen to it	no
4550	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I'm s-	no
4551	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	There's no,	no
4552	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Oh!	no
4553	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	For a couple of reasons.	no
4554	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well, but the	no
4555	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	There are	no
4556	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4557	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Hmm.	no
4558	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	But we can F_T_P stuff over, right? So	no
4559	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right.	no
4560	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4561	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	And we've	no
4562	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4563	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4564	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4565	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	O_K.	no
4566	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Um.	yes
4567	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	One suggestion I have is that um	no
4568	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I think this -	no
4569	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right.	no
4570	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	O_K.	no
4571	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	because - because this is very f- we -	no
4572	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Mm-hmm.	no
4573	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	and this is a pretty	no
4574	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Mm-hmm.	no
4575	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So maybe we should do another	no
4576	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well right I - I just did ten per page I could easily do twenty per page.	no
4577	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4578	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well this is us. We'll have a fair amount of annoyance yeah I think	no
4579	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Mm-hmm.	no
4580	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4581	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So, can we do - we do another set? Are we - are we - are we - sort of -	no
4582	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Sure.	no
4583	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Sure.	no
4584	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	we talked out about what we're -	yes
4585	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well no, O_K, the question I still have about what we're going to do is	no
4586	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	O_K.	no
4587	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right.	no
4588	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	what is - what - eh - O_K, so we can get the equipment set up so that	no
4589	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	basically we're in a situation where we can -	no
4590	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Um.	no
4591	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	What are - wh- When are we - Are we going to do that? Who are they going to be? What meetings are we going to record?	no
4592	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Us, to begin with.	no
4593	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So which - which meetings - What meetings do we have?	no
4594	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I think that's the intention.	no
4595	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	"I mean like ""us"" being the Meeting Recorder people or ""us"" being anything that speech"	no
4596	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well, I think -	no
4597	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I think, um, certainly us, Meeting Recorder.	no
4598	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4599	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Um, us	no
4600	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	And we should have like - we should have Decoder meetings and stuff.	no
4601	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	And uh	no
4602	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Exactly exactly. I think there are enough	no
4603	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	um, then you can just do	no
4604	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah, I mean that's the thing. It's O_K to g-	no
4605	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right.	no
4606	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Which	no
4607	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4608	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right.	no
4609	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	is for spontaneous meetings.	no
4610	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well, we've got to make it really really easy to start it going then in that case. Cuz that - that's the real	no
4611	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right.	no
4612	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	That's right.	no
4613	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	That's why I put	no
4614	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right. But I mean if we - if we want	no
4615	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right. Well, I - I bet they would be willing to do it the first few times, just for the novelty.	no
4616	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4617	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4618	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I think they would.	no
4619	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	And also he's - he's - he's got	no
4620	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	That's great. I know.	no
4621	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Oh, that's a good	no
4622	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	And we're - we have a little problem of	no
4623	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Boy, that's abs- I had never - I hadn't even thought about that.	no
4624	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I know, it's a disaster.	no
4625	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah, well, when L- when Liz uh Shriberg starts coming, then there's another woman although she -	no
4626	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Oh, man!	no
4627	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	It's alright she doesn't mind as long as we don't video her, right?	no
4628	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4629	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Ah, that's right. That was it. So.	no
4630	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Maybe we should have the reading group here and force Jane to come.	no
4631	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4632	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah. No, well, actually we could have Jane uh - Jane's interested and curious about this stuff so she could attend one of - probably not the decoder meeting but some of the other stuff she	no
4633	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Mm-hmm.	no
4634	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4635	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	We could - we could have the reading group in here. Yeah.	no
4636	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah, I mean it's a different	no
4637	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4638	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah, it's great.	no
4639	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4640	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Um,	no
4641	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Um,	no
4642	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	O_K.	no
4643	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Um	no
4644	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I think that one of the neat things about having this little	no
4645	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	is we should try it a couple different ways,	no
4646	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Mm-hmm.	no
4647	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	so we should	no
4648	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Mm-hmm	no
4649	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Mm-hmm.	no
4650	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	send the same thing out, or maybe split it in halves or something - something like that	no
4651	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Mm-hmm.	no
4652	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	to a - to an outside service	no
4653	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	and uh see what	no
4654	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right.	no
4655	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	And then we can	no
4656	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah, the - the	no
4657	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	assess it.	no
4658	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well,	no
4659	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Except that you wouldn't transcribe them all individually, right? You would send - I mean,	no
4660	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	No.	no
4661	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	No.	no
4662	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right. This was - this was the point of having near zero skew. Right?	no
4663	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right?	no
4664	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So you just pick one,	no
4665	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	with the best sounding one, and give it to somebody and they transcribe it.	no
4666	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Oh, you're right, yeah, yeah, yeah.	no
4667	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4668	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right.	no
4669	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So	no
4670	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So - so they - they're gonna - they're gonna have to make speaker assignments	no
4671	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	They're going to have to make speaker assignments, and wh- and	no
4672	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	For one of - one of	no
4673	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Or we could mix - we could mix the - the headset mikes, you know, just to make a single	no
4674	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	high q- high quality -	no
4675	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right.	no
4676	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Oh, that would be interesting.	no
4677	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	and we could do -	no
4678	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	and we could do all kinds of weird things like having you know squelch so that	no
4679	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	cut it out when there's no energy. So you don't	no
4680	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Mm-hmm.	no
4681	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah, you could do fancy things, but it seems like that's enough.	no
4682	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4683	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4684	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I mean there's - it's -	no
4685	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	O_K.	no
4686	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	If we - if we do something which is have a little bit of human input to get the words	no
4687	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	then we can	no
4688	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	by some	no
4689	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Mm-hmm.	no
4690	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	probably.	no
4691	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yet.	no
4692	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So that - I mean, that's	no
4693	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Um.	no
4694	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah. And - Yeah. As much work as you want.	no
4695	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah	no
4696	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	But uh I don't know. This meeting,	no
4697	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4698	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	um	no
4699	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Mm-hmm.	no
4700	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4701	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	And uh we'll see	no
4702	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Mm-hmm.	no
4703	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	uh from whoever does it	no
4704	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	and um then uh	no
4705	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	like I say, check it out with an external service and see	no
4706	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right.	no
4707	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Mm-hmm.	no
4708	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah, one of the things I was thinking with transcript is that if we	no
4709	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	and	no
4710	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	if the	no
4711	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Hmm.	no
4712	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I bet it	no
4713	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4714	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	unless it's really close to	no
4715	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I have - just because it's such an un-	no
4716	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	The	no
4717	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right.	no
4718	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	whereas having this distraction	no
4719	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	of having sort of something that	no
4720	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Some errors, yeah.	no
4721	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	very wrong bits in	no
4722	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	is sort of a less - less easy thing to do.	no
4723	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I don't know. I do- I don't know the answer to that.	no
4724	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I'm sure the professional transcribers obviously don't have any use for -	no
4725	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I don't know.	no
4726	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah	no
4727	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well, I mean there's this Cyber Transcriber service, right?	no

4925	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh, and we focused for the - the test part on the English and the Italian.	no
4926	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Um. We've trained uh several neural networks on - so - on the T_I-digits English	no
4927	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mmm, so there's our result tables here, for the tandem approach, and um, actually what we - we	no
4928	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I can't get	no

4949	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So um,	no
4950	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah, so if the network is trained on the task data um	no
4951	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
4952	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Do you mean if it's trained	no
4953	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Only on, yeah.	no
4954	transcript	transcript_Bro004	On data from just that task, that language?	no
4955	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Just that task.	no
4956	transcript	transcript_Bro004	But actually we didn't train network on	no
4957	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mmm.	no
4958	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
4959	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Um	no

4962	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So what's th-	no
4963	transcript	transcript_Bro004	clearly it's gonna be	no
4964	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I mean,	no
4965	transcript	transcript_Bro004	From what I saw from the earlier results, uh I guess last week,	no
4966	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mmm. Yeah.	no
4967	transcript	transcript_Bro004	But - but the question is if you	no
4968	transcript	transcript_Bro004	If we use the same language?	no
4969	transcript	transcript_Bro004	No, no, no.	no
4970	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
4971	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I don't have the	no
4972	transcript	transcript_Bro004	But -	no
4973	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah but I did not uh do that. We -	no
4974	transcript	transcript_Bro004	E-	no
4975	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So, you didn't train on	no
4976	transcript	transcript_Bro004	No, we did four - four kind of - of testing, actually.	no
4977	transcript	transcript_Bro004	The first testing is	no
4978	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So for Italian on the Italian speech	no
4979	transcript	transcript_Bro004	The second test is trained on a single language	no
4980	transcript	transcript_Bro004	um with broad	no
4981	transcript	transcript_Bro004	O_K.	no
4982	transcript	transcript_Bro004	But for Italian we choose Spanish which	no
4983	transcript	transcript_Bro004	The third test is by using, um	no
4984	transcript	transcript_Bro004	the three language database	no
4985	transcript	transcript_Bro004	and the fourth is	no
4986	transcript	transcript_Bro004	W- which in - It has three languages. That's including the w-	no
4987	transcript	transcript_Bro004	the -	no
4988	transcript	transcript_Bro004	This includes -	no
4989	transcript	transcript_Bro004	the one that it's -	no
4990	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
4991	transcript	transcript_Bro004	But	no
4992	transcript	transcript_Bro004	In-	no
4993	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Right.	no
4994	transcript	transcript_Bro004	The three languages	no
4995	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah	no
4996	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And the fourth test is uh	no
4997	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Oh, O_K, yeah, so, that	no
4998	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
4999	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I just wasn't	no
5000	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh, yeah.	no
5001	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So um	no
5002	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Relative.	no
5003	transcript	transcript_Bro004	The error rate increase u- of - of -	no
5004	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Right.	no
5005	transcript	transcript_Bro004	of ten percent, relative.	no
5006	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So this is not so bad. And then when we jump to the multilingual data it's uh it become worse and, well	no
5007	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Ab- about how much?	no
5008	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Around uh, let's say,	no
5009	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Twenty percent	no
5010	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Twenty to - to thirty percent further. Yeah.	no
5011	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And so, remind me, the	no
5012	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5013	transcript	transcript_Bro004	It's not the digits. So it's the combination of	no
5014	transcript	transcript_Bro004	It's	no
5015	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5016	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5017	transcript	transcript_Bro004	O_K.	no

5021	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So.	no
5022	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yes.	no
5023	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I- i- if you compare everything to the first case at the baseline,	no
5024	transcript	transcript_Bro004	for the - for the using the same language but a different task, and something like one point three	no
5025	transcript	transcript_Bro004	No no no.	no
5026	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh same language we are at uh - for at English at O_ point eight.	no
5027	transcript	transcript_Bro004	But -	no
5028	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So. Le-	no
5029	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I - I - I'm sorry. I - I - I meant something different by baseline	no
5030	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Tas- task data we are u-	no
5031	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5032	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So let me - let me -	no
5033	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Um,	no
5034	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mmm.	no
5035	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Hmm.	no
5036	transcript	transcript_Bro004	By baseline here I meant	no

5038	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah, O_K. Yeah.	no
5039	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So I was just - I just trying to understand	no
5040	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah. Sure.	no
5041	transcript	transcript_Bro004	just normalized to	no
5042	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mmm.	no

5069	transcript	transcript_Bro004	It's multilingual.	no
5070	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah. The only difference it's - is that it's multilingual -	no
5071	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Um	no

5096	transcript	transcript_Bro004	eight kilohertz sampling.	no
5097	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Right.	no
5098	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So you have band-limited TIMIT,	no
5099	transcript	transcript_Bro004	O_K?	no
5100	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Hmm?	no
5101	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Um	no

5110	transcript	transcript_Bro004	um	no
5111	transcript	transcript_Bro004	It doesn't seem to matter -	no
5112	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mmm.	no
5113	transcript	transcript_Bro004	It sounds like um	no
5114	transcript	transcript_Bro004	in the training set.	no
5115	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Um	no
5116	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So	no
5117	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh, let me check. Uh.	no

5122	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mmm.	no
5123	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I have a suggestion, actually, even though it'll delay us slightly, would - would you mind	no

5178	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh. No.	no
5179	transcript	transcript_Bro004	You mean	no
5180	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Digits on another language?	no

5186	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Um	no
5187	transcript	transcript_Bro004	What -	no
5188	transcript	transcript_Bro004	These numbers are uh	no
5189	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So, I mean wha- what's the - This - this chart - this table that we're looking at	no
5190	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So.	no
5191	transcript	transcript_Bro004	show- is all	no
5192	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Bigger is worse.	no
5193	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So you have uh basically two	no
5194	transcript	transcript_Bro004	No.	no
5195	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah, yeah, yeah.	no
5196	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
5197	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5198	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And the first four rows is well-matched, then the s- the second group of four rows is mismatched, and	no
5199	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So, so the upper part is	no
5200	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So.	no
5201	transcript	transcript_Bro004	It's - it's the H_T_K results, I mean. So it's	no
5202	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Hmm.	no
5203	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So.	no
5204	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh	no
5205	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5206	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Well,	no
5207	transcript	transcript_Bro004	What was is that i-	no
5208	transcript	transcript_Bro004	What was it that you had	no
5209	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Wh- when you showed me	no
5210	transcript	transcript_Bro004	It- It was part of these results.	no
5211	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mmm.	no
5212	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mmm.	no
5213	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So where is the baseline	no
5214	transcript	transcript_Bro004	You mean the H_T_K Aurora baseline?	no
5215	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5216	transcript	transcript_Bro004	It's uh the one hundred number.	no
5217	transcript	transcript_Bro004	It's, well, all these numbers are the ratio	no
5218	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Ah!	no
5219	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Ah, O_K, O_K.	no
5220	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So this is word - word error rate, so a	no
5221	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah, this is	no
5222	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5223	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5224	transcript	transcript_Bro004	O_K, I see.	no
5225	transcript	transcript_Bro004	seventy point two means that	no
5226	transcript	transcript_Bro004	O_K, O_K, gotcha.	no
5227	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Hmm.	no
5228	transcript	transcript_Bro004	um	no
5229	transcript	transcript_Bro004	let's see	no
5230	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5231	transcript	transcript_Bro004	um	no
5232	transcript	transcript_Bro004	To TIMIT.	no
5233	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mmm.	no
5234	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Then you have	no
5235	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And we can - we can see on the first line of the table that it - it -	no
5236	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Right.	no
5237	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So, I'm sorry. I missed that. What's M_F, M_S and M_E?	no
5238	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Multi-French, Multi-Spanish	no
5239	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So. Multi-French, Multi-Spanish, and Multi-English.	no

5241	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5242	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Then -	no
5243	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And -	no
5244	transcript	transcript_Bro004	what I saw in your smaller chart that I was thinking of was -	no
5245	transcript	transcript_Bro004	was	no
5246	transcript	transcript_Bro004	and I was seeing	no
5247	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I - I think that was all it was. You had some very limited results that - at that point	no
5248	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5249	transcript	transcript_Bro004	that were -	no
5250	transcript	transcript_Bro004	where - where English was	no

5252	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5253	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Um now, what's the noise condition	no
5254	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Well, I think this is what you were explaining. The	no
5255	transcript	transcript_Bro004	It's the same uh Aurora noises	no
5256	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5257	transcript	transcript_Bro004	uh, in all these cases	no
5258	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5259	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So there's not a	no
5260	transcript	transcript_Bro004	No these are the s- s- s- same noises, yeah.	no
5261	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Well matched condition.	no
5262	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Right.	no
5263	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Now I	no
5264	transcript	transcript_Bro004	testing these on u- this same sort of thing on -	no
5265	transcript	transcript_Bro004	the other	no
5266	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mmm.	no
5267	transcript	transcript_Bro004	On - on um -	no
5268	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So.	no
5269	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Um, oh I well,	no

5276	transcript	transcript_Bro004	There - there is -	no
5277	transcript	transcript_Bro004	In - in	no
5278	transcript	transcript_Bro004	For - for the Italian part I mean the	no
5279	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Aurora-two.	no
5280	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And the noise is different	no
5281	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Do we have any um	no
5282	transcript	transcript_Bro004	have the	no
5283	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mmm, no.	no
5284	transcript	transcript_Bro004	No.	no
5285	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Can I ask something real quick?	no
5286	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5287	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I- is	no
5288	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5289	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So that's	no
5290	transcript	transcript_Bro004	It's - no, the third part, so it's uh	no
5291	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So - why do you get your	no
5292	transcript	transcript_Bro004	in -	no
5293	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Wouldn't you get your	no
5294	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Well, it's relative to the	no
5295	transcript	transcript_Bro004	um	no
5296	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5297	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Ah, O_K so these are not -	no

5300	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5301	transcript	transcript_Bro004	O_K.	no
5302	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And then - so, in the - in the um -	no
5303	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5304	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Oh! So this upper third?	no
5305	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So - Yeah.	no
5306	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh that's still noisy?	no
5307	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5308	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Ah, O_K.	no
5309	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So it's always noisy basically,	no
5310	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
5311	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I see.	no
5312	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mmm.	no
5313	transcript	transcript_Bro004	O_K?	no
5314	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Um	no
5315	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So uh, I think this will take some	no
5316	transcript	transcript_Bro004	what is	no
5317	transcript	transcript_Bro004	uh, i- that -	no
5318	transcript	transcript_Bro004	just filling in the holes here or - or - ?	no
5319	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh, no we don't plan to fill the holes but	no
5320	transcript	transcript_Bro004	O_K.	no
5321	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Um	no
5322	transcript	transcript_Bro004	these are the results we obtained for Italian	no
5323	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
5324	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mmm.	no
5325	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And the, mmm - what's	no
5326	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Where is that? seventy-nine, fifty	no
5327	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Fifty-one? This -	no
5328	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh, it's just sort of sitting right on the uh - the column line.	no
5329	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So.	no
5330	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh.	no
5331	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Oh I see, O_K.	no
5332	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Just - uh	no
5333	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5334	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5335	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yes.	no
5336	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yes.	no
5337	transcript	transcript_Bro004	We improve.	no
5338	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So, do you know what was	no
5339	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah. There were diff- there were different things and	no
5340	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So it adapts more	no
5341	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh-huh.	no
5342	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yes. Yeah.	no
5343	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
5344	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Right.	no
5345	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And Pratibha did something different is that he - uh she initialed the um values of the mean and variance	no
5346	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mmm. There were other minor differences, the fact that	no
5347	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh, but the main differences concerns the recursion.	no
5348	transcript	transcript_Bro004	O_K.	no
5349	transcript	transcript_Bro004	We - It - it's	no
5350	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
5351	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5352	transcript	transcript_Bro004	But, well it's similar.	no
5353	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
5354	transcript	transcript_Bro004	O_K.	no
5355	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So basically what I expect is that	no
5356	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Right.	no
5357	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Right.	no
5358	transcript	transcript_Bro004	O_K, but I think that	no
5359	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mmm.	no
5360	transcript	transcript_Bro004	because of	no
5361	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5362	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So do you - are you - w-	no
5363	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah	no
5364	transcript	transcript_Bro004	did you have something going on, on the side, with uh multi-band	no
5365	transcript	transcript_Bro004	No, I - we plan to start this uh so, act- actually we have discussed uh	no
5366	transcript	transcript_Bro004	If we trained the networks on the - on	no
5367	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
5368	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mmm.	no
5369	transcript	transcript_Bro004	But the way the feature gives -	no
5370	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I di-	no
5371	transcript	transcript_Bro004	The - the way the network gives the features is that it reduce completely the -	no
5372	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So -	no
5373	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Doing something like, um	no
5374	transcript	transcript_Bro004	well, basically context dependent phonemes.	no
5375	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Maybe. I mean, I - I think	no
5376	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah but, we know that -	no
5377	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Right.	no
5378	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Right?	no
5379	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Ye- yeah but here it's something different. We want to have features uh well,	no
5380	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5381	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
5382	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh, and you're	no
5383	transcript	transcript_Bro004	That - that's true	no
5384	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So, for that reason, when you - in -	no
5385	transcript	transcript_Bro004	in - in a	no
5386	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5387	transcript	transcript_Bro004	O_K?	no
5388	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I - I'm - I'm sort of -	no
5389	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And	no
5390	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So um	no
5391	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh, the -	no
5392	transcript	transcript_Bro004	a particular context, for instance you may have some kinds of contexts that will	no
5393	transcript	transcript_Bro004	We already actually don't have a huge amount of training data	no
5394	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah, but -	no
5395	transcript	transcript_Bro004	mmm,	no
5396	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I mean,	no
5397	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Right.	no
5398	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And	no
5399	transcript	transcript_Bro004	binary decisions about	no
5400	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh	no
5401	transcript	transcript_Bro004	But I mean it - it - it	no
5402	transcript	transcript_Bro004	It's -	no
5403	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5404	transcript	transcript_Bro004	It's - and -	no
5405	transcript	transcript_Bro004	and	no
5406	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5407	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah, sure but	no
5408	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Oh no, but it would	no
5409	transcript	transcript_Bro004	But - yeah, but -	no
5410	transcript	transcript_Bro004	That would be even - even	no
5411	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah, but if -	no
5412	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh, I mean for instance,	no
5413	transcript	transcript_Bro004	the - the thing I was arguing for	no
5414	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mmm.	no
5415	transcript	transcript_Bro004	again which I don't think we have time to	no
5416	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
5417	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mmm.	no
5418	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah, perhaps you're right, but you have more classes so	no
5419	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
5420	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Um	no
5421	transcript	transcript_Bro004	True.	no
5422	transcript	transcript_Bro004	But still the information is relevant because it's - it's information that helps to discriminate,	no
5423	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
5424	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
5425	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Well it's - it's -	no
5426	transcript	transcript_Bro004	But the -	no
5427	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mmm.	no
5428	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mmm.	no
5429	transcript	transcript_Bro004	but the - the	no
5430	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mmm.	no
5431	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mmm.	no
5432	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh we haven't been doing any of the L_D_	no
5433	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
5434	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
5435	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So what i- what is going on right	no
5436	transcript	transcript_Bro004	N-	no
5437	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I - I - I'm trying the H_T_K with eh,	no
5438	transcript	transcript_Bro004	The combination, I see.	no
5439	transcript	transcript_Bro004	The combination, yeah. But I haven't result	no
5440	transcript	transcript_Bro004	M_S_G and - and P_L_P.	no
5441	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5442	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Ye- Uh, with the old	no
5443	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5444	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5445	transcript	transcript_Bro004	know soon.	no
5446	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Maybe.	no
5447	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I don't know.	no
5448	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5449	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh, O_K.	no
5450	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh so there is this combination, yeah. Working on combination obviously.	no
5451	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
5452	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yep.	no
5453	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Um.	no
5454	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And	no
5455	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So, get simpler networks,	no
5456	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And we have -	no
5457	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Basically we have three	no
5458	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Twenty-seven.	no
5459	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Twenty-seven broad classes.	no
5460	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So like, uh,	no
5461	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So what you do -	no
5462	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Um	no
5463	transcript	transcript_Bro004	How many - how many nets do you have?	no
5464	transcript	transcript_Bro004	For the moments we do not - don't have nets, I mean,	no
5465	transcript	transcript_Bro004	No nets.	no
5466	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Begin to work in this.	no
5467	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Were we just changing	no
5468	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Right.	no
5469	transcript	transcript_Bro004	But - but I didn't understand -	no
5470	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And then -	no
5471	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
5472	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh.	no
5473	transcript	transcript_Bro004	output. So you're having multiple nets and combining them,	no
5474	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh, how are you - how are you coming up with -	no
5475	transcript	transcript_Bro004	If you say	no
5476	transcript	transcript_Bro004	It-	no
5477	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I think they have one output.	no
5478	transcript	transcript_Bro004	It's the single net, yeah.	no
5479	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Oh, it's just one net.	no
5480	transcript	transcript_Bro004	mm-hmm	no
5481	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5482	transcript	transcript_Bro004	It's one net with	no
5483	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I see.	no
5484	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I see, O_K.	no
5485	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So it's - Well, it's basically a standard net with fewer	no
5486	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So you're sort of going the	no
5487	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah, but I think - Yeah.	no
5488	transcript	transcript_Bro004	But	no
5489	transcript	transcript_Bro004	B- b-	no
5490	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5491	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I don't think this	no
5492	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I think it will get worse because	no
5493	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh-huh.	no
5494	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Well, I believe the effect that - of - of too	no
5495	transcript	transcript_Bro004	reducing too much the information is	no
5496	transcript	transcript_Bro004	But you think if you include that	no
5497	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah, because	no
5498	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Because these nets are trained on well-controlled condition. I mean the labels are obtained on clean speech, and we add noise after.	no
5499	transcript	transcript_Bro004	But perhaps, something intermediary using also	no
5500	transcript	transcript_Bro004	well,	no
5501	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5502	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And you have the	no
5503	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5504	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Which are P_L_P, or something.	no
5505	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
5506	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And then uh, just to remind me, all of that goes	no
5507	transcript	transcript_Bro004	uh, that all of that is transformed by uh, uh, K_- K_L or something, or - ?	no
5508	transcript	transcript_Bro004	There will probably be, yeah, one single K_L to transform everything or	no
5509	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mu.	no
5510	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Right.	no
5511	transcript	transcript_Bro004	No transform the P_L_P and only	no
5512	transcript	transcript_Bro004	transform the other	no
5513	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I'm not sure.	no
5514	transcript	transcript_Bro004	This is	no
5515	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Well no, I think -	no
5516	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Two e-	no
5517	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So there's a question of whether you would -	no
5518	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5519	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Right.	no
5520	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Whether you would transform	no
5521	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5522	transcript	transcript_Bro004	But that's	no
5523	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So that's something that you're - you	no
5524	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5525	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5526	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Um	no
5527	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mmm.	no
5528	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh, yeah.	no
5529	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So I think, you know, we need to	no
5530	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
5531	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
5532	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Um, let me pass this out,	no
5533	transcript	transcript_Bro004	These are -	no
5534	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Did - did -	no
5535	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah, I have one.	no
5536	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh, no. I don't think so.	no
5537	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah, I have one.	no
5538	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Oh, thanks.	no
5539	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Ah!	no
5540	transcript	transcript_Bro004	We have one.	yes
5541	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Ah!	no
5542	transcript	transcript_Bro004	We have one.	no
5543	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Something I asked -	no
5544	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So they're - they're doing	no
5545	transcript	transcript_Bro004	voice	no
5546	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So again, it's the silence -	no
5547	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So they've just trained up a net	no
5548	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I asked uh	no
5549	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
5550	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh.	no
5551	transcript	transcript_Bro004	To get the speech -	no
5552	transcript	transcript_Bro004	voice activity detection, or else just using the silence,	no
5553	transcript	transcript_Bro004	But on the other hand, maybe they can get by with a smaller net	no
5554	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
5555	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Their uh -	no
5556	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5557	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Um,	no
5558	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mmm.	no
5559	transcript	transcript_Bro004	But they have a question of the result. Um how are	no
5560	transcript	transcript_Bro004	How	no
5561	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mmm.	no
5562	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I- I'm sorry. I don't understand your question.	no
5563	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yes, um the L_D_A filter	no
5564	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I don't know exactly	no
5565	transcript	transcript_Bro004	It's on	no
5566	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Training, with the training test of each -	no
5567	transcript	transcript_Bro004	You understand me?	no
5568	transcript	transcript_Bro004	No.	no
5569	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah, uh for example,	no
5570	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yes.	no
5571	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yes, I don't know.	no
5572	transcript	transcript_Bro004	That's - that's - so that's a -	no
5573	transcript	transcript_Bro004	that's a very good question, then -	no
5574	transcript	transcript_Bro004	now that it -	no
5575	transcript	transcript_Bro004	In	no
5576	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5577	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah, because maybe it the same situation that the neural network training with their own	no
5578	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mmm.	no
5579	transcript	transcript_Bro004	set.	no
5580	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah, I don't know.	no
5581	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Um,	no
5582	transcript	transcript_Bro004	but uh to tell you the	no
5583	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And um, it ap-	no
5584	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Oh that's -	no
5585	transcript	transcript_Bro004	The features, yeah.	no
5586	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5587	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I don't understand also what is -	no
5588	transcript	transcript_Bro004	"It says ""baseline A_S_P""."	no
5589	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah, I don't know.	no
5590	transcript	transcript_Bro004	A_S_P.	no
5591	transcript	transcript_Bro004	This is -	no
5592	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Oh.	no
5593	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Anybody know	no
5594	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Um	no
5595	transcript	transcript_Bro004	"Cuz there's ""baseline"	no
5596	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And it's -	no
5597	transcript	transcript_Bro004	This is	no
5598	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Well, it says baseline A_S_P is twenty-three mill	no
5599	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5600	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah, it	no
5601	transcript	transcript_Bro004	From the baseline.	no
5602	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I think this was -	no
5603	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5604	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I think -	no
5605	transcript	transcript_Bro004	when - when we were up in Oregon.	no
5606	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I think it's the C_zero - using C_zero instead of log energy. Yeah, it's	no
5607	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Ah, O_K, mm-hmm.	no
5608	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Oh.	no
5609	transcript	transcript_Bro004	O_K.	no
5610	transcript	transcript_Bro004	It should be that, yeah.	no
5611	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Because -	no
5612	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Shouldn't it be -	no
5613	transcript	transcript_Bro004	They s-	no
5614	transcript	transcript_Bro004	they say in here that the V_A_D is	no
5615	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5616	transcript	transcript_Bro004	they estimate - they get a -	no
5617	transcript	transcript_Bro004	But that -	no
5618	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
5619	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And so um,	no
5620	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
5621	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Hmm.	no
5622	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Right?	no
5623	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So um -	no
5624	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So it's - it's -	no
5625	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I don't understand. You mean it's throwing out frames?	no
5626	transcript	transcript_Bro004	It's throwing out chunks of frames, yeah.	no
5627	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Before -	no
5628	transcript	transcript_Bro004	There's - the - the median filter is enforcing that it's	no
5629	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5630	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah, that's what I was just gonna ask. How can you just throw out frames?	no
5631	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5632	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Well,	no
5633	transcript	transcript_Bro004	i-	no
5634	transcript	transcript_Bro004	you - you	no
5635	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5636	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5637	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
5638	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Huh.	no
5639	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5640	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah, you can basically remove the - the frames from the feature - feature files. And.	no
5641	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5642	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah, so I mean in the - i- i- in the - in the	no
5643	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I t-	no
5644	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
5645	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I think they're - they're - they're treating it,	no
5646	transcript	transcript_Bro004	In the text they say that this - this is a	no
5647	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So that sort of sounds like they're not	no
5648	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Well.	no
5649	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I think what I mean by tha- that is they're trying to come up with a block diagram that's plausible for the standard.	no
5650	transcript	transcript_Bro004	In other words, it's - uh -	no
5651	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5652	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5653	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I'm just wondering what exactly	no
5654	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Um.	no
5655	transcript	transcript_Bro004	But it's - the thing is it's that - that - that's - that's I - I -	no
5656	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Certainly it would be tricky about it intrans- in transmitting	no
5657	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
5658	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Plus it's gonna introduce delays.	no
5659	transcript	transcript_Bro004	It	no
5660	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mmm.	no
5661	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I	no
5662	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Temporal and spectral.	no
5663	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Ah, thank you.	no
5664	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah	no
5665	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So um.	no
5666	transcript	transcript_Bro004	The	no
5667	transcript	transcript_Bro004	he - well, by -	no
5668	transcript	transcript_Bro004	by saying this is a b- a tentative block di- diagram I think means	no
5669	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So um	no
5670	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I think that it's - it's	no
5671	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh, as you know,	no
5672	transcript	transcript_Bro004	But, on the	no
5673	transcript	transcript_Bro004	The question we're gonna wanna go	no
5674	transcript	transcript_Bro004	combinations of features and multi-band	no
5675	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh, and we've been looking at	no
5676	transcript	transcript_Bro004	on-line normalization and the uh	no
5677	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh, because we still have - even once we	no
5678	transcript	transcript_Bro004	but - but uh	no
5679	transcript	transcript_Bro004	When they removed the silence frames, did they insert some kind of a marker so that the recognizer knows it's -	no
5680	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Well, see they, I - I think they're	no
5681	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Um.	no
5682	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I don't know the -	no
5683	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Oh, right.	no
5684	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Maybe they're just inserting some nummy frames or something?	no
5685	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh, you know	no
5686	transcript	transcript_Bro004	But I don't - I don't think they	no
5687	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Hmm.	no
5688	transcript	transcript_Bro004	p- put some low level noise or something.	no
5689	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Probably don't want all zeros. Most recognizers don't like zeros but	no
5690	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Hmm.	no
5691	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5692	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Some constant vector.	no
5693	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I mean i- w-	no
5694	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Or something -	no
5695	transcript	transcript_Bro004	but I mean it's	no
5696	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
5697	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So that the - the	no
5698	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Hmm.	no
5699	transcript	transcript_Bro004	But	no
5700	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5701	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Cuz you gotta do	no
5702	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5703	transcript	transcript_Bro004	It would do	no
5704	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah, right.	no
5705	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah, yeah.	no
5706	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5707	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh.	yes
5708	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So, O_K, So I think	no
5709	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Um	no
5710	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh, I wanna look at these numbers off-line a little bit and think about it and -	no
5711	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Um, but uh	no
5712	transcript	transcript_Bro004	No I mean it sounds like - I mean	no
5713	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Um	no
5714	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
5715	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh	no
5716	transcript	transcript_Bro004	But -	no
5717	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I	no
5718	transcript	transcript_Bro004	But	no
5719	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5720	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I think we're alright, um,	no
5721	transcript	transcript_Bro004	O_K.	no
5722	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Computation?	no
5723	transcript	transcript_Bro004	It's O_K.	no
5724	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah. Yeah, well.	no
5725	transcript	transcript_Bro004	But -	no
5726	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Are - were you folks using Gin?	no
5727	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mmm, no. You were using Gin	no
5728	transcript	transcript_Bro004	No.	no
5729	transcript	transcript_Bro004	No? Oh, that's good. O_K.	no
5730	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah,	no
5731	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yes.	no
5732	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Hmm.	no
5733	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Tonic.	no
5734	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
5735	transcript	transcript_Bro004	U-	no
5736	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Do we -	no
5737	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Go ahead.	no
5738	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Do we have that big new I_B_M machine the, I think in th-	no
5739	transcript	transcript_Bro004	We have the	no
5740	transcript	transcript_Bro004	It's got s- slots for eight,	no
5741	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So instead of having eight processors that were eight hundred megahertz, we ended up with two	no
5742	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And more are supposed to come soon and there's only a moderate amount of dat- of memory. So I don't think	no
5743	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Hopefully,	no
5744	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh, yeah, I think that'll be - once we get it populated,	no
5745	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And uh - and uh a nice amount of memory. Uh so it'll be a pr- pretty fast Linux machine.	no
5746	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And if we can do things on Linux,	no
5747	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
5748	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Um	no
5749	transcript	transcript_Bro004	It seems pretty fast.	no
5750	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
5751	transcript	transcript_Bro004	But -	no
5752	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I think Fudge is pretty fast too.	no
5753	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah, I mean you can	no
5754	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And it	no
5755	transcript	transcript_Bro004	There's - there's - there's gonna be	no
5756	transcript	transcript_Bro004	But.	no
5757	transcript	transcript_Bro004	turned my head your direction. That's one thing you don't get in these recordings. You don't get the -	no
5758	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I- is it um	no
5759	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh, I think yes.	no
5760	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Isn't that right? I mean I think you're - you're sort of held up by both, right?	no
5761	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mmm.	no
5762	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5763	transcript	transcript_Bro004	It sounded like they were roughly equal?	no
5764	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Is that about right?	no
5765	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5766	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5767	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Because, um	no
5768	transcript	transcript_Bro004	get	no
5769	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh, probably the neural net cuz it's probably - it - it's -	no
5770	transcript	transcript_Bro004	For H_T_K?	no
5771	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh	no
5772	transcript	transcript_Bro004	O_K.	no
5773	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5774	transcript	transcript_Bro004	O_K.	no
5775	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Well, I don't know how we can -	no
5776	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mmm.	no
5777	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5778	transcript	transcript_Bro004	You would	no
5779	transcript	transcript_Bro004	They	no
5780	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah?	no
5781	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And you can parallelize the training.	no
5782	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And run it on several machines and it just basically keeps counts.	no
5783	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Aha!	no
5784	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And there's something -	no
5785	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I see.	no
5786	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mmm.	no
5787	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I don't what their scripts are	no
5788	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5789	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Something that we haven't really settled on yet is other than	no
5790	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Um.	no
5791	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So I - I think the - the advantage of going with the neural net thing is that we're gonna use the neural net trainings,	no
5792	transcript	transcript_Bro004	no matter what,	no
5793	transcript	transcript_Bro004	O_K.	no
5794	transcript	transcript_Bro004	for a lot of the things we're doing,	no
5795	transcript	transcript_Bro004	whereas, w- exactly which	no
5796	transcript	transcript_Bro004	H_M_M - Gaussian-mixture-based H_M_M thing we use is gonna depend	no
5797	transcript	transcript_Bro004	uh	yes
5798	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So with that,	no
5799	transcript	transcript_Bro004	maybe we should uh	no
5800	transcript	transcript_Bro004	go to our	no
5801	transcript	transcript_Bro004	digit recitation task.	no

6036	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	It's slightly different. I -	no
6037	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Thanks.	no
6038	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	O_K.	no
6039	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Same idea?	no
6040	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	But, same idea. So, if you've looked at this you've seen it before, so	no
6041	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	It's not indicated	no
6042	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	with, um	no
6043	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	O_K, so,	no
6044	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	It's indicated to - to - so the people know	no
6045	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	which - which stretches of speech were in the	no
6046	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	versus being overlapped by others. So, I	no
6047	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And, um	no
6048	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	What you can see is the number of overlaps	no
6049	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	what I was looking for sp- sp- specifically	no
6050	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And	no
6051	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	The	no
6052	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	What was - what's the - the	no
6053	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mmm.	no
6054	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
6055	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Ah.	no
6056	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
6057	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	At the very end,	no
6058	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	this is when people were,	no
6059	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
6060	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
6061	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And, again	no
6062	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And, um	no
6063	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	who else, and	no
6064	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I'm sorry, but you're o- alphabetical, that's why I'm choosing you	no
6065	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And then if you look across the	no
6066	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Hmm!	no
6067	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
6068	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And,	no
6069	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Is this uh	no
6070	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	by.	no
6071	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Raw counts.	no
6072	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So it would be interesting to see	no
6073	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	how much each person	no
6074	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
6075	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yes,	no
6076	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah	no
6077	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6078	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Normalized to how much -	no
6079	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Of the times a person spoke	no
6080	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And	no
6081	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	uh i- e-	no
6082	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	S- so, i- it would be	no
6083	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	No - no actually, that would be	no
6084	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	No, no, no.	no
6085	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah, yeah.	no
6086	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah, yeah.	no
6087	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah, yeah.	no
6088	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah, that's right.	no
6089	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6090	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Excuse me.	no
6091	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	now,	no
6092	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	B- I - I -	no
6093	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	But the numbers speak for themselves.	no
6094	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	He's - Yeah, yeah, yeah.	no
6095	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yes, that's right, so you don't nee-	no
6096	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	saying on the tape who did	no
6097	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Sure.	no
6098	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah, when - this is what -	no
6099	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6100	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	This is actually - when Jane sent this email	no
6101	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Well, fair enough.	no
6102	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6103	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And	no
6104	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	there's also the question of what type of overlap	no
6105	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	i- and I - and I	no
6106	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	viewed as being	no
6107	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Uh-huh.	no
6108	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Exactly!	no
6109	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah	no
6110	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And - and,	no
6111	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And - and, als- I mean,	no
6112	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I can't	no
6113	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	but anyway, the people who used to say it was strict,	no
6114	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	ack- acknowledge the influence of	no
6115	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Then it beco-	no
6116	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	um	no
6117	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	uh, there are backchannels, like what Adam just did now and, um	no
6118	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	um, anticipating the end of a	no
6119	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and	no
6120	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
6121	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	No problem.	no
6122	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And places	no
6123	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	which I thought were interesting, where two or	no
6124	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	"everyone's saying ""yes"" or - you know, or"	no
6125	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	ev- even more sp-	no
6126	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So, uh, the point is that, um	no
6127	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Well, of course th- the biggest,	no
6128	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yep.	no
6129	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yes, yes!	no
6130	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Oh, O_K - interesting.	no
6131	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	That - that -	no
6132	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6133	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Right?	no
6134	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Hundred ninety-seven.	no
6135	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I think there's one -	no
6136	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	one minute there where there - where - where there wasn't any overlap? I mean, it's -	no
6137	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	S- n- are -	no
6138	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Well, at the bottom, you have the bottom three.	no
6139	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	It's -	no
6140	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	It'd be interesting -	no
6141	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6142	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	You have -	no
6143	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Oh, so the bottom three	no
6144	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	But it w-	no
6145	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yes, uh-huh. Yeah. But just no overlaps.	no
6146	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	There	no
6147	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	O_K, so	no
6148	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	It'd be	no
6149	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	versus -	no
6150	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yes, exactly and that's - that's where Jose's	no
6151	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I was about to ask -	no
6152	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah, yeah,	no
6153	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6154	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6155	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I h- I have this- that infor- I have th- that information	no
6156	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Hmm.	no
6157	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	now.	no
6158	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Oh, about how much	no
6159	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	The - the	no
6160	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	O- oh, what's - what's the - what's the average	no
6161	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	M- I - I haven't averaged it now but, uh	no
6162	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	You don't know?	no
6163	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I will do the - the study of the -	no
6164	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	O_K, you - you don- you don't have a feeling for roughly how	no
6165	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	mmm,	no
6166	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	The duration is, uh	no
6167	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6168	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
6169	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	on the dat-	no
6170	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I suspect that it will also differ,	no
6171	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	but eh -	no
6172	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6173	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Because, on your	no
6174	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	eh,	no
6175	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6176	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6177	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	"Uh, i- probably it's very difficult to - to - because the - the overlap is, uh on- is only the - in the final ""S_"""	no
6178	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	of the - of the - the fin- the - the end - the end word of the, um	no
6179	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
6180	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	with the - the next word of the - the new speaker.	no
6181	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Um, I considered	no
6182	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and - the idea is probably, eh	no
6183	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
6184	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	With eh	no
6185	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6186	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah, but I - I'd -	no
6187	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Can I -	no
6188	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6189	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	You split this by minute, um	no
6190	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yes.	no
6191	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	straddles	no
6192	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
6193	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	um	no
6194	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Uh, so	no
6195	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	A_ starts speaking	no
6196	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and then B_ overlaps with A_,	no
6197	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	No, but suppose they both	no
6198	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	talk simultaneously	no
6199	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	both a - a	no
6200	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	O_K. In that case, um	no
6201	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	"Yeah, ""yets"" is not a word."	no
6202	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	since we haven't incorporated Adam's method of handling overl- overlaps yet	no
6203	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	um	no
6204	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	We just haven't done th- the precise second to sec- you know,	no
6205	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I- I-	no
6206	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I- I-	no
6207	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I'm - I'm - I'm confused now. So l- l- let me restate what I	no
6208	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Uh-huh.	no
6209	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Let's say that in - in second fifty-seven	no
6210	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yep.	no
6211	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	of one minute,	no
6212	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	O_K.	no
6213	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and	no
6214	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
6215	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So we go over - So we were - we were	no
6216	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	in	no
6217	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Right?	no
6218	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm?	no
6219	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So, um	no
6220	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Is this	no
6221	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	It would be considered as an overlap in the	no
6222	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	O_K, so that's	no
6223	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	That's -	no
6224	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6225	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Statistical.	no
6226	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6227	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm. Yeah. They're	no
6228	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yep.	no
6229	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Other- otherwise you'd get	no
6230	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6231	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Ah but,	no
6232	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	yeah.	no
6233	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6234	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6235	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I - I didn't count that as a	no
6236	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
6237	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Because the idea was the	no
6238	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	These are simplifying assumptions, didn't happen very often, there may be like three overlaps affected that way in the whole thing.	no
6239	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6240	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I want to go back and listen to minute forty-one.	no
6241	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah, yeah.	no
6242	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Cuz i- i- I find it	no
6243	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6244	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I mean what I	no
6245	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	would have	no
6246	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	That's interesting.	no
6247	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6248	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6249	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	but uh	no
6250	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	apparently	no
6251	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mmm.	no
6252	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah, there's a lot of backchannel, a lot o- a lot of -	no
6253	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6254	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I	no
6255	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	find out	no
6256	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Cuz in	no
6257	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	It's just that people haven't been	no
6258	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
6259	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm?	no
6260	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So, the question is, you know, how many more overlaps	no
6261	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	to a	no
6262	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Well, but see, I find it interesting even if it	no
6263	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So.	no
6264	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	because	no
6265	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm?	no
6266	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	It depends what you're	no
6267	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So if you were actually	no
6268	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	if -	no
6269	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Right now we're do- we have	no
6270	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm?	no
6271	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So the question is, you know -	no
6272	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	"""are there really more overlaps"	no
6273	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	than there would be in a	no
6274	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Let -	no
6275	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	let m-	no
6276	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And - and there well may	no
6277	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	let me rephrase what I'm saying	no
6278	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	cuz I don't think I'm getting it across.	no
6279	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	What -	no
6280	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	what I - what -	no
6281	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	"I shouldn't use words like """	no
6282	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	But what I	no
6283	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	that, um	no
6284	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And what we're doing	no
6285	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	not	no
6286	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	that w- uh at least,	no
6287	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	the scenario in which, uh	no
6288	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And so,	no
6289	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I - I agree that it's an issue here	no
6290	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
6291	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	you know, this	no
6292	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Maybe far field	no
6293	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
6294	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	so if each of us was calling and having	no
6295	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And, just the question is,	no
6296	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
6297	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	of more than one person, and	no
6298	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So it may be that having	no
6299	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	That's an	no
6300	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So.	no
6301	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Not you,	no
6302	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	But uh -	no
6303	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Were you?	no
6304	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Though it wasn't	no
6305	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	but -	no
6306	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	but	no
6307	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Were you - were you - were you - were you measuring it?	no
6308	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	There - there's	no
6309	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	actually	no
6310	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	to tell you the truth, the reason why it's hard to measure is because	no
6311	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	of	no
6312	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	so, from the point of view of studying	no
6313	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6314	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	you want to know the	no
6315	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So what happens is if	no
6316	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6317	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and then you keep going	no
6318	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	what it	no
6319	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	even though my backchannel occurred completely	no
6320	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah?	no
6321	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So, for things like language modeling or dialogue modeling	no
6322	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	it's -	no
6323	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	We	no
6324	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah?	no
6325	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	in real time.	no
6326	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	But,	no
6327	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	of	no
6328	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	the	no
6329	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	people couldn't	no
6330	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah, I wasn't	no
6331	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So,	no
6332	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Right? I was just saying that w-	no
6333	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	it's -	no
6334	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	um	no
6335	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And - and - and, you - you maybe	no
6336	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Well, we've als-	no
6337	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Right. We're	no
6338	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So that's why it's coming to us as	no
6339	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Um.	no
6340	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	if it's the	no
6341	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and if actually you have as	no
6342	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	we	no
6343	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	The reason we	no
6344	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and it wasn't	no
6345	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah, all I meant is	no
6346	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	that	no
6347	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	if you're asking the question from the point of view of	no
6348	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm?	no
6349	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	studying	no
6350	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	kinds of questions you could ask with a	no
6351	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	It's	no
6352	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	but we just couldn't	no
6353	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And	no
6354	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	We do kn- we don't know the numbers.	no
6355	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Well,	no
6356	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	there	no
6357	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So.	no
6358	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	It's - but I don't know	no
6359	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	in fact	no
6360	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Well, here-	no
6361	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	that would be	no
6362	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	See, I mean, i- i- le- let me t-	no
6363	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	interesting to know.	no
6364	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	"I mean, my point was just if you wanted to say to somebody, """	no
6365	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	just never mind comparison with something else,	no
6366	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
6367	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	what we've learned about is	no
6368	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6369	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Right?	no
6370	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	In - in the sense that i- if you said	no
6371	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah,	no
6372	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	if - i- i- i-	no
6373	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I - I don't di-	no
6374	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	In a way, I guess what I'm comparing to is more the	no
6375	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I	no
6376	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	agree with	no
6377	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	that.	no
6378	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	common	no
6379	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	how - how much people	no
6380	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Uh	no
6381	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and now I look at	no
6382	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Right.	no
6383	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	That's also true of	no
6384	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	It may not be -	no
6385	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I wasn't saying it	no
6386	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Right?	no
6387	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	um	no
6388	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I was commenting about	no
6389	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	O_K.	no
6390	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I'm saying if	no
6391	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	All I'm saying is that from the	no
6392	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and we sh- which,	no
6393	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	But - Then, if I was gonna describe to somebody what did you learn	no
6394	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	In fact -	no
6395	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	bunch of overlaps -	no
6396	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	it's	no
6397	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Right.	no
6398	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	but that there's overlaps, uh	no
6399	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And that's	no
6400	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Right.	no
6401	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	No, I - I agree with that.	no
6402	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I'm just	no
6403	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	saying that it may -	no
6404	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Oh	no
6405	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6406	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And	no
6407	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah, I wasn't making any	no
6408	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	that's all.	no
6409	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And - and it would actually be interesting to find	no
6410	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6411	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	some of the	no
6412	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	data say Switchboard, which isn't exactly the same kind of context, I mean these are two people who	no
6413	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	But we should	no
6414	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	say what - what is the	no
6415	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	time	no
6416	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	of each additional person, or something like that.	no
6417	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yep. I could	no
6418	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah, that would be good to know, but w- we -	no
6419	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	What -	no
6420	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	But yeah.	no
6421	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6422	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
6423	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Right.	no
6424	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	you know, as	no
6425	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	goes rolling past,	no
6426	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
6427	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	well, depending, but	no
6428	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Right.	no
6429	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah, this is d- also um,	no
6430	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	people	no
6431	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Well -	no
6432	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Right.	no
6433	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	uh, ambient thing.	no
6434	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and, just to finish this,	no
6435	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	that um	no
6436	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	That I think that	no
6437	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	there may be an upper bound on	no
6438	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	fray.	no
6439	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	But I - you know,	no
6440	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	of certain	no
6441	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	people	no
6442	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	there may be	no
6443	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I - I have a	no
6444	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	the vast majority of overlaps in	no
6445	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I think, to backchannel if - in a multi-audience -	no
6446	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	you know, in a multi-person	no
6447	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	If you can	no
6448	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	audience.	no
6449	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Right.	no
6450	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6451	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	u-	no
6452	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	That may not be the case if you couldn't see them.	no
6453	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	But -	no
6454	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	"it's unusual to have everybody going ""uh-huh, uh-huh"""	no
6455	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Actually,	no
6456	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6457	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	There's a lot of	no
6458	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Um.	no
6459	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6460	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yep, we need to put	no
6461	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	In - in the	no
6462	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah, yeah, yeah.	no
6463	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Plus - plus - plus the -	no
6464	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	He	no
6465	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	That's in part because the	no
6466	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah, you don't have it.	no
6467	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	so you	no
6468	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Your mike is -	no
6469	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So, in the	no
6470	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	is there a great deal of	no
6471	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	That	no
6472	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	There you go.	no
6473	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yes.	no
6474	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6475	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Thank you.	no
6476	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	E- for example.	no
6477	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	it happens when there's a	no
6478	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	you know, like you - you	no
6479	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yes.	no
6480	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	get a lot of backchannel, when somebody's	no
6481	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Right.	no
6482	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Sorry, what were you saying?	no
6483	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	It's	no
6484	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Um	no
6485	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	no, when - when - when there's	no
6486	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Oh.	no
6487	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I was just	no
6488	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and when there's	no
6489	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and a	no
6490	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and then they start	no
6491	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	h-	no
6492	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I just wonder how much overlap there is.	no
6493	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Is there a lot?	no
6494	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I	no
6495	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	"I mean, this is called ""precision timing"" in"	no
6496	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	where	no
6497	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	overlapping,	no
6498	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	the	no
6499	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	information is mostly	no
6500	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So all you're missing is some last syllables or something or the last word or some highly predictable words.	no
6501	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mmm.	no
6502	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
6503	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	But	no
6504	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	But maybe a - just a	no
6505	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	It'd be	no
6506	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I was just thinking more in terms of	no
6507	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6508	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So -	no
6509	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6510	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Well, that's	no
6511	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Right.	no
6512	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Right.	no
6513	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	uh	no
6514	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So - so	no
6515	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
6516	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Uh, to distinguish between, say,	no
6517	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	precision timing - Sort of	no
6518	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	you know,	no
6519	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and - and -	no
6520	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Let's pick a different word.	no
6521	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and sort of, um	no
6522	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	someone is trying to grab the floor from someone else.	no
6523	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6524	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Uh,	no
6525	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Hostile takeovers.	no
6526	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6527	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6528	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6529	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Well, I mean you could do that. I ju- I - I think that	no
6530	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6531	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	O_K.	no
6532	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
6533	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Um, I could imagine that as - there's a fair number of	no
6534	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	um	no
6535	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	cases where,	no
6536	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and this is sort of, not	no
6537	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	you have, like,	no
6538	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Trying to	no
6539	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6540	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And so it's	no
6541	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I have a	no
6542	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	um	no
6543	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	are - are	no
6544	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Right.	no
6545	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah, I agree. I agree.	no
6546	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I wonder what determines who	no
6547	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Well, there are	no
6548	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I mean -	no
6549	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Uh a vote - vote in Florida.	no
6550	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	It's been studied a	no
6551	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Um, o- one thing - I - I wanted to -	no
6552	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	or you can tell a good joke and then everybody's laughing and you get a chance to g- break in. But. But.	no
6553	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Seniority.	no
6554	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Um.	no
6555	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	You know, the	no
6556	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Ach.	no
6557	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So, um	no
6558	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	suggests that we should make a conscious attempt to have,	no
6559	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	um	no
6560	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	a - a fair number of meetings	no
6561	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	with, uh	no
6562	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	a	no
6563	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Right?	no
6564	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I mean	no
6565	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	we - most of our meetings are	no
6566	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Should we	no
6567	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	just to - to - to	no
6568	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	beef up the - the	no
6569	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	That's a control.	no
6570	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Well,	no
6571	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	it seems like there are	no
6572	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	y- like a	no
6573	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	is not as	no
6574	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
6575	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Well, Liz was raising the question of - of whether i- it's the number - there's a relationship between the number of people and the number of overlaps or type of overlaps there,	no
6576	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
6577	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and, um	no
6578	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	If you had two people meeting in this kind of circumstance then you'd still have the visuals. You wouldn't have that difference	no
6579	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	say, in	no
6580	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
6581	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Uh	no
6582	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah, I'm just thinking that'd be more like a c-	no
6583	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6584	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
6585	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Well, but from the	no
6586	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6587	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	it's all good.	no
6588	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Is the same.	no
6589	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah,	no
6590	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	If - if the goal were to	no
6591	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	you could serve yourself -	no
6592	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yep.	no
6593	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Well, I was thinking you	no
6594	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	from the	no
6595	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Well, that's - the - that was my - my status report, so	no
6596	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6597	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	You've been	no
6598	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6599	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6600	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
6601	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	you'd get some rough statistics.	no
6602	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So.	no
6603	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	But -	no
6604	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	what - what do you think about that?	no
6605	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I guess my - my first comment was, um	no
6606	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	um	no
6607	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	we should n- not attribute	no
6608	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6609	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	everybody knew that, but that	no
6610	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	in normal	no
6611	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	conversation with two people there's an awful lot of the same kinds of overlap, and that it would be interesting	no
6612	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
6613	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	to	no
6614	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	look at	no
6615	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	what maybe the	no
6616	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	you know, because now you can have	no
6617	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	there're - they back	no
6618	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	only one person at a time with one person	no
6619	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
6620	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	interrupting at a time.	no
6621	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So, I don't know. To answer your question I	no
6622	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	crucial to have	no
6623	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	controls but I think it's worth recording all the meetings we	no
6624	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Well,	no
6625	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6626	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So, um	no
6627	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	you know.	no
6628	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	D- I wouldn't	no
6629	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Right.	no
6630	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Could we -	no
6631	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Could we, um -	no
6632	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	we have - have in the	no
6633	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Uh-huh.	no
6634	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah, we	no
6635	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And,	no
6636	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	uh,	no
6637	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	to, um	no
6638	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	as another c-	no
6639	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	um	no
6640	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	see what - what	no
6641	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	what	no
6642	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So, um -	no
6643	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Can we actually record?	no
6644	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	It just seems like that's a very	no
6645	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Uh	no
6646	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I mean	no
6647	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Well, we'll have to set	no
6648	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6649	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Well, we're not really set up for it	no
6650	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	But.	no
6651	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6652	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	this is getting a little	no
6653	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	we could put up	no
6654	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	some kind of	no
6655	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Barriers!	no
6656	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6657	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	That's what they	no
6658	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	you know, this Map Task corpus?	no
6659	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	They ran exactly the same pairs of people with and without	no
6660	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	visual cues and it's quite interesting.	no
6661	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Well, we - we record this meeting so	no
6662	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I mean	no
6663	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	O_K, we can	no
6664	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Well, we could just put	no
6665	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6666	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Well y- no you - f- Yeah, Yeah.	no
6667	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Blindf-	no
6668	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Turn off the	no
6669	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and we'd take a picture of everybody sitting here with blindfolds.	no
6670	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	That would -	no
6671	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Oh, th-	no
6672	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Um, what - I had	no
6673	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	rather than take pictures of the	no
6674	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Well, linguistic -	no
6675	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And, uh -	no
6676	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6677	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yes.	no
6678	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Linguistic anthropologists would - would suggest it would be useful to	no
6679	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	There's a head nodding here vigorously, yeah.	no
6680	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	also take a picture of the	no
6681	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	The -	no
6682	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Why - why do we want to have a picture of the meeting?	no
6683	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Ee-	no
6684	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	because you get then the	no
6685	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	no -	no
6686	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Well, you could do that by just	no
6687	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah	no
6688	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6689	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6690	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I'll do that. I'll do that on the next set of forms.	no
6691	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6692	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah. Is possible to get information from the	no
6693	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So you'd	no
6694	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I	no
6695	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	We can - can't you figure it out from the	no
6696	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	put native language on the	no
6697	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	No.	no
6698	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	O_K.	no
6699	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	The	no
6700	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And even the	no
6701	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Oh.	no
6702	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	But	no
6703	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah, but	no
6704	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	It would be another	no
6705	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	It's - it would be trivial -	no
6706	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	It would be a research task.	no
6707	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Having - having ground tu- truth would be	no
6708	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah, yeah.	no
6709	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	You know where you could get it?	no
6710	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6711	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So I'm gonna put little	no
6712	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
6713	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Not the	no
6714	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	But you have to keep the chairs in the same pla- like here.	no
6715	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	But, uh -	no
6716	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Put them -	no
6717	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	The chair-	no
6718	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Like,	no
6719	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yep.	no
6720	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6721	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yep.	no
6722	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6723	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	But you know, they - the - s-	no
6724	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	the linguistic	no
6725	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Posture, and we could like,	no
6726	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	What people were	no
6727	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6728	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	The fashion statement.	no
6729	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Oh,	no
6730	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	How big their	no
6731	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	the -	no
6732	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	how a person is sitting	no
6733	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6734	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	But if you just f-	no
6735	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	But from one picture, I don't know that you really get that. Right?	no
6736	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	You'd want a video for that, I think.	no
6737	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	It'd be better than	no
6738	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	A video, yeah.	no
6739	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	i- Just from a	no
6740	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Think so?	no
6741	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I mean I - I could	no
6742	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And -	no
6743	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And -	no
6744	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	really do -	no
6745	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	eh -	no
6746	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	The body language is very uh -	no
6747	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Hmm.	no
6748	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	is very interesting in terms of the dominance aspect.	no
6749	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6750	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And - and	no
6751	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6752	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Well, I mean you black out the -	no
6753	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Hmm.	no
6754	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	He agreed.	no
6755	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	you know?	no
6756	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Of course, the -	no
6757	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6758	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and it's	no
6759	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	run into the	no
6760	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Oh, no, you - you just like to be in	no
6761	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I just want to be at the	no
6762	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6763	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Take control.	yes
6764	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6765	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah, I've been playing with, um	no
6766	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6767	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	uh, using the	no
6768	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So my	no
6769	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and so I played with that a little bit, and	no
6770	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	it works O_	no
6771	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	your filter width and your	no
6772	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So if you fiddle around with it a little bit and you get good numbers you can actually do a pretty good job of segmenting when someone's talking and when they're not.	no
6773	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	But if you try to use the same parameters on another	no
6774	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	the absolute	no
6775	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	But does it work for that one speaker throughout the whole	no
6776	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	It	no
6777	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Um	no
6778	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	How did you do it Adam?	no
6779	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6780	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I mean, wh- what was the -	no
6781	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	The algorithm was, uh	no
6782	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6783	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	take	no
6784	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	o- every frame that's over the threshold,	no
6785	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and then median-filter it,	no
6786	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
6787	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and then look for runs.	no
6788	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So there was a	no
6789	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Every frame that's over	no
6790	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	A	no
6791	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	In terms of	no
6792	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6793	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Ah!	no
6794	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	O_K.	no
6795	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Say that again?	no
6796	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Frame over fres- threshold.	no
6797	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So you take a - each frame, and you compute the energy and if it's over the threshold you set it to	no
6798	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Hmm.	no
6799	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	so now you have a	no
6800	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	O_K.	no
6801	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And then I	no
6802	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	using, um	no
6803	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Uh	no
6804	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Um	no
6805	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and that's to average out	no
6806	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	you know,	no
6807	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	you know, the	no
6808	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and things like that.	no
6809	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And then, uh	no
6810	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	looked for long runs.	no
6811	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	O_K	no
6812	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And that works O_	no
6813	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Did you ever try running the filter	no
6814	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	No.	no
6815	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I certainly could though.	no
6816	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	But this was just	no
6817	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I	no
6818	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	O_K and then the	no
6819	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Javier's	no
6820	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	the problem is - he does it in two passes, the first pass	no
6821	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And he does that using a neural net doing broad	no
6822	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	has the	no
6823	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	the, uh	no
6824	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And so the	no
6825	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Um	no
6826	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	looking for	no
6827	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	uh	no
6828	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	whether it	no
6829	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And what looks like it's	no
6830	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	even on the	no
6831	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	the broad phone class classifier's doing a really bad job.	no
6832	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Uh, I have no idea. I don't remember.	no
6833	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Hmm.	no
6834	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Does an- do you remember, Morgan, was it Broadcast News?	no
6835	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I think so, yeah.	no
6836	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Um	no
6837	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So, at any rate, my	no
6838	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	uh,	no
6839	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	as the way of generating the candidates.	no
6840	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Because one of the things that	no
6841	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	They're	no
6842	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	But, like, it could be someone who isn't the person	no
6843	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And so I think	no
6844	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	But, I haven't gotten very far on that.	no
6845	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	But	no
6846	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	uh, but eh	no
6847	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I - I - I think, eh	no
6848	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	when - when, y- I -	no
6849	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	there is a - a great difference in the - in the signal.	no
6850	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Oh,	no
6851	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	but eh I -	no
6852	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	not -	no
6853	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	but eh	no
6854	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I - I - I mean that eh eh	no
6855	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	you can find, uh	no
6856	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	great different, eh	no
6857	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Um	no
6858	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I - I think for, eh	no
6859	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	h- mmm, - more or less, eh, like eh	no
6860	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	eh, mmm, first sound energy detector.	no
6861	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Say it again?	no
6862	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	eh nnn.	no
6863	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	When y- you the detect the - the - the	no
6864	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	detector of, ehm princ- um. What is the - the name in	no
6865	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	the de- detector of, ehm of a word in the - in the s- in -	no
6866	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	an isolated word	no
6867	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	in - in the	no
6868	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I'm - I'm not sure what you're	no
6869	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	That, uh	no
6870	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I mean that when - when you use, eh	no
6871	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I think he's saying the	no
6872	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6873	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Onset detector, O_K.	no
6874	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I - I think it's probably	no
6875	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	eh	no
6876	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And probably is not so easy	no
6877	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	when you use the - the P_D_A, eh that -	no
6878	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Right.	no
6879	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Because the signal is, eh	no
6880	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	in - in that, eh	no
6881	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Right.	no
6882	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	between the different eh, speaker,	no
6883	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	But different	no
6884	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I - I think is - eh, it will	no
6885	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	the - the change.	no
6886	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I think that, um	no
6887	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Ah, in the clo- in the P_D_	no
6888	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6889	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I review the - the - the work of Javier. I think the, nnn, the, nnn,	no
6890	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	to - to get a broad class of phonetic, eh	no
6891	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	a candidate from the - the - the speech signal.	no
6892	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	If you have, eh	no
6893	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	uh, I'm considering, only because Javier, eh	no
6894	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Right.	no
6895	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	to detect	no
6896	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	the - the possibility of a - a change between the - between the speaker,	no
6897	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	to consider hypothesis	no
6898	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	eh	no
6899	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
6900	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah, when a	no
6901	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Because, I - I - I think it's more realistic that, uh	no
6902	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	eh	no
6903	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	is - is, eh	no
6904	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	event, important to - to consider.	no
6905	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
6906	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
6907	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I - I found that the, eh	no
6908	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	without enough silence between - between	no
6909	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I think	no
6910	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	eh	no
6911	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I_X or, mmm,	no
6912	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
6913	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	in my opinion.	no
6914	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	was not because he thought it was	no
6915	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6916	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	it was - it was - it was the place he was	no
6917	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yep.	no
6918	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So, he was trying to get something going, and, uh e- e- you know, as - as -	no
6919	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6920	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.	no
6921	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6922	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	pick a realistic goal,	no
6923	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah,	no
6924	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	yeah, yeah, yeah.	no
6925	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Uh-huh.	no
6926	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	But, eh	no
6927	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	to apply	no

6935	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
6936	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	An- and then, eh	no
6937	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	eh	no
6938	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	like a- another parameter in the - in the feature vector, eh.	no
6939	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Right. Absolutely.	no
6940	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
6941	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	This -	no
6942	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	to the -	no
6943	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Right.	no

6988	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	they can come up with something that gets most of the cases fairly easily.	no
6989	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Then it gets	no

6996	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6997	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	That - that means you set some	no
6998	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
6999	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and - and so	no
7000	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	From something that you	no
7001	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	um	no
7002	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	H- how are you going to adapt whatever you can very quickly learn about the new data?	no
7003	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Uh, if it's gonna be different from old data that you have?	no
7004	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And I think that's a problem	no
7005	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Well, also what	no
7006	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	with this.	no
7007	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	is trying to use the	no
7008	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah!	no

7021	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	um, I, unfortunately, have to run, but, um	no
7022	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I can imagine	no

7028	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	um	no
7029	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	If you	no
7030	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and you build, um -	no
7031	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	basically I think you'd - you would	no

7038	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	It's a little big.	no
7039	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	It's not that big actually, um	no
7040	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Two to the	no
7041	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Two to the number of people in the meeting.	no
7042	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Actually, Andreas may- maybe - maybe just something	no
7043	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
7044	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	along the lines of what you're saying, I was just realizing, I used to know this guy who used to build, uh	no
7045	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mmm.	no
7046	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	um,	no
7047	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah	no

7052	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	you - you	no
7053	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
7054	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And then he had some sort of	no
7055	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	reasonable way of	no
7056	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	uh, what if you were just looking at very	no
7057	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I was	no
7058	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
7059	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	But I	no
7060	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
7061	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So, not just - just the loudest.	no
7062	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
7063	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	But, eh	no
7064	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Sorry. I - I have found that when - when I	no

7066	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	O_K.	no
7067	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I analyzed the - the speech files from the,	no
7068	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Could you fill that out anyway?	no
7069	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Are y- you want me to do it? I'll do it.	no
7070	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	But	no
7071	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I know.	no
7072	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Oh.	no
7073	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	with a - a different level of energy.	no
7074	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	including overlap zone.	no
7075	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	because, eh	no
7076	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	more o- or less energy	no
7077	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	i- in the mixed sign- in the signal.	no
7078	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and then,	no
7079	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	in - in, uh, and you process the - the - in - the - the - the speech file from the - the - the mixed signals.	no
7080	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I - I think it's - it's difficult, um	no
7081	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	We have eh, eh, overlapping zone	no
7082	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Eh, if you process only the the energy of the, of each frame.	no
7083	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Well, it's probably harder, but I - I think what I was s-	no
7084	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	nnn	no
7085	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	noting	no
7086	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	just when he - when Andreas	no
7087	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	of the microphones and you may not need to look at very	no
7088	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
7089	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
7090	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	because if there's -	no
7091	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	if	no

7093	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no

7636	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Well, I was thinking if um - y- you guys have plans for Sunday? We're - we're not - it's probably going to be this Sunday, but um we're sort of working with the weather here	no
7637	transcript	transcript_Bed004	because we also want to combine it with some barbecue activity where we just fire it up and what - whoever brings whatever	no
7638	transcript	transcript_Bed004	you know, can throw it on there.	no
7639	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So only the tiramisu is free,	no
7640	transcript	transcript_Bed004	nothing else.	no
7641	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Well, I'm going	no
7642	transcript	transcript_Bed004	back to visit my	no
7643	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So you're going to the	no
7644	transcript	transcript_Bed004	No,	no
7645	transcript	transcript_Bed004	No, the	no
7646	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Well,	no
7647	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K, I'll let you know.	no
7648	transcript	transcript_Bed004	I'm sorry. I was looking for you guys downstairs. I didn't know that you had moved the meeting. Alright.	no
7649	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K.	no
7650	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So, are we recording ourselves?	no
7651	transcript	transcript_Bed004	We	no
7652	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Alright.	no
7653	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Is Nancy s- uh gonna show up?	no
7654	transcript	transcript_Bed004	She's got a student with her now. So, she probably won't.	no
7655	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Mmm.	no
7656	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Wonder if these things ever	no
7657	transcript	transcript_Bed004	emit a very,	no
7658	transcript	transcript_Bed004	like, piercing screech right in your ear?	no
7659	transcript	transcript_Bed004	No, no. The Human Subjects Committee wouldn't allow it.	no
7660	transcript	transcript_Bed004	They are gonna get more comfortable headsets.	no
7661	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Good.	no
7662	transcript	transcript_Bed004	They already ordered them.	no
7663	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Uh-huh.	yes
7664	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K.	no
7665	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Let's get started.	no
7666	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Uh -	no
7667	transcript	transcript_Bed004	The uh -	no
7668	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Should I go first, with the uh,	no
7669	transcript	transcript_Bed004	um,	no
7670	transcript	transcript_Bed004	data. Can I have the remote	no
7671	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K.	no
7672	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So. On Friday we had our wizard test data test	no
7673	transcript	transcript_Bed004	and um	no
7674	transcript	transcript_Bed004	these are some of the results.	no
7675	transcript	transcript_Bed004	This was the introduction.	no
7676	transcript	transcript_Bed004	I actually uh,	no
7677	transcript	transcript_Bed004	even though Liz was uh kind enough to offer to be the first subject, I	no
7678	transcript	transcript_Bed004	sort of felt that she knew too	no
7679	transcript	transcript_Bed004	just	no
7680	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Mm-hmm.	no
7681	transcript	transcript_Bed004	on the spur of the moment, and she was uh kind enough to uh	no
7682	transcript	transcript_Bed004	serve as the first subject. So, this is what she	no
7683	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Uh, that was really difficult for her	no
7684	transcript	transcript_Bed004	and uh -	no
7685	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Because of l- all the names, you mean?	no
7686	transcript	transcript_Bed004	The names and um	no
7687	transcript	transcript_Bed004	this was the uh first three tasks she had to - to master after she	no
7688	transcript	transcript_Bed004	and um	no
7689	transcript	transcript_Bed004	then of course the system broke down, and those were the l- uh	no
7690	transcript	transcript_Bed004	uh I should say the system was	no
7691	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Um.	no
7692	transcript	transcript_Bed004	There are -	no
7693	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Mmm.	no
7694	transcript	transcript_Bed004	And I will	no
7695	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Culture on every corner, and more than ten museums	no
7696	transcript	transcript_Bed004	We will	no
7697	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Um.	no
7698	transcript	transcript_Bed004	And um.	no
7699	transcript	transcript_Bed004	The	no
7700	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Thank you for calling Heidelberg Tourist Information. How may I help you?	no
7701	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Wait, can I -	no
7702	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Hi. I want to um	no
7703	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So there's	no
7704	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah. It was bo- it both times the same person.	no
7705	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K.	no
7706	transcript	transcript_Bed004	One time,	no
7707	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"And she didn't - I mean. Well. Isn't this kind of obvious when it says ""O_K now you're talking to a human"" and then the human has the same voice?"	no
7708	transcript	transcript_Bed004	No no no.	no
7709	transcript	transcript_Bed004	We u-	no
7710	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K, good question, but uh	no
7711	transcript	transcript_Bed004	you - you just wait and see.	no
7712	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K.	no
7713	transcript	transcript_Bed004	It's - You're gonna l- learn.	no
7714	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Because she was actually - they - there was some uh lapse in the um wireless,	no
7715	transcript	transcript_Bed004	we have to move her closer.	no
7716	transcript	transcript_Bed004	I'm deciding on going to the concert of the Hindelberg - for the Hindelberg Symphony Orchestra.	no
7717	transcript	transcript_Bed004	I want to buy something elegant in one of the designer boutiques	no
7718	transcript	transcript_Bed004	which is located on	no
7719	transcript	transcript_Bed004	In order to get to the	no
7720	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K.	no
7721	transcript	transcript_Bed004	And -	no
7722	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Is she mispronouncing	no
7723	transcript	transcript_Bed004	I want	no
7724	transcript	transcript_Bed004	They're mispronouncing	no
7725	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K.	no
7726	transcript	transcript_Bed004	A sunken castle differs from the regular sort of castle in that it is built in a flat region, rather than on a mountain.	no
7727	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K.	no
7728	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Oh, and I also remember that someone told me about the historic graffiti in the old student prison.	no
7729	transcript	transcript_Bed004	And I wanted to know how to get there.	no
7730	transcript	transcript_Bed004	In order to get to the student prison, from the university square, turn right,	no
7731	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K.	no
7732	transcript	transcript_Bed004	This is the system breaking down, actually.	no
7733	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Hello?	no
7734	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yes.	no
7735	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Uh, I'm sorry, something uh seems to have happened to the system. Um, - see if I can help you.	no
7736	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Are you a live person? or is this a recording?	no
7737	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Th- I'm a live person.	no
7738	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K. Um, thing I was gonna ask you, um, O_K,	no
7739	transcript	transcript_Bed004	I need to know where you are, first of all-	no
7740	transcript	transcript_Bed004	W- where am I? Um, I don't know.	no
7741	transcript	transcript_Bed004	See - c- figure it out?	no
7742	transcript	transcript_Bed004	I see a building that's um under construction.	no
7743	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K, uh-huh.	no
7744	transcript	transcript_Bed004	That's p- that's probably the university square.	no
7745	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K. So, that's where I am.	no
7746	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K. So, uh, what do you need to do?	no
7747	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Um.	no
7748	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Can you give me a description of the Powder-Tower, at the Hindelberg castle?	no
7749	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah, in order to get there you have to take a bus, you've got to take the number forty-two	no
7750	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Uh-huh.	no
7751	transcript	transcript_Bed004	To the town hall station. And then you have to transfer to the funicular train. And take the castle exit and turn right. And after about half a mile you'll see the - the Powder-Tower on your right hand side.	no
7752	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K. And - How much is it for the train and the bus?	no
7753	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Um, you can get a - a transfer on the - on the bus for the train for about uh four marks.	no
7754	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K. O_K, that's it.	no
7755	transcript	transcript_Bed004	That's all you need to do?	no
7756	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Mm-hmm, thanks for your help.	no
7757	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Sure, bye-bye.	no
7758	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Bye.	no
7759	transcript	transcript_Bed004	I thought it was a recording.	no
7760	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah.	no
7761	transcript	transcript_Bed004	But it was a real person.	no
7762	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Did I call Europe?	no
7763	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"""Did I call Europe?"""	no
7764	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Well, if we - we um	no
7765	transcript	transcript_Bed004	We had	no
7766	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Um, maybe she had some doubts	no
7767	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So, are - are you trying to record this meeting?	no
7768	transcript	transcript_Bed004	There was a strange reflex.	no
7769	transcript	transcript_Bed004	I have a headache. I'm really sort of out of it. O_K, the uh	no
7770	transcript	transcript_Bed004	lessons learned.	no
7771	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Um,	no
7772	transcript	transcript_Bed004	that was already anticipated by	no
7773	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Really?	no
7774	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Oh, it's surprising.	no
7775	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"S- so if you just number them ""one"", ""two"", ""three"" it's"	no
7776	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah, and make it sort of clear in the uh -	no
7777	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K.	no
7778	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Right.	no
7779	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Um. We need to - So that's one thing. And we need a better introduction for the wizard. That is something that Fey actually thought of a - in the last second that sh- the system should introduce	no
7780	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Mm-hmm.	no
7781	transcript	transcript_Bed004	True.	no
7782	transcript	transcript_Bed004	And um, um, another suggestion, by	no
7783	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Mm-hmm.	no
7784	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Um, we have to refine the tasks more and more, which of course we haven't done at all, so far,	no
7785	transcript	transcript_Bed004	in order to avoid this	no
7786	transcript	transcript_Bed004	they	no
7787	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Say exactly what's on there? Yeah.	no
7788	transcript	transcript_Bed004	And uh my suggestion is of course we - we keep the wizard, because I think she did a wonderful job, in the sense that she responded quite nicely to things that were not	no
7789	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Great.	no
7790	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"asked for, ""How much is a t- a bus ticket and a transfer"" so this is gonna happen all the time, we d- you can never be sure."	no
7791	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Mm-hmm.	no
7792	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Um. Johno pointed out that uh we have maybe a grammatical gender problem there with wizard.	no
7793	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yes. I wasn't - wasn't sure whether wizard was the correct term for	no
7794	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"uh ""not a man""."	no
7795	transcript	transcript_Bed004	But uh -	no
7796	transcript	transcript_Bed004	There's no female equivalent of -	no
7797	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Are you sure?	no
7798	transcript	transcript_Bed004	No, I don't know.	no
7799	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Right.	no
7800	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Well, there is witch and warlock, and uh -	no
7801	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah, that's what I was thinking, but -	no
7802	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah, that's so	no
7803	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Right.	no
7804	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Right.	no
7805	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K.	no
7806	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Uh.	no
7807	transcript	transcript_Bed004	And um -	no
7808	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So, some - some work needs to be done, but I think we can uh -	no
7809	transcript	transcript_Bed004	And this, and - in case no - you hadn't seen it, this is what Litonya	no
7810	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Ah.	no
7811	transcript	transcript_Bed004	um while taking the -	no
7812	transcript	transcript_Bed004	while partaking in the data	no
7813	transcript	transcript_Bed004	collection.	yes
7814	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K, great.	no
7815	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So	no
7816	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Um, do you know exactly how to do that, or is uh Lila - I mean, you know what exactly do we do to - to put her on the payroll in some way?	no
7817	transcript	transcript_Bed004	I'm completely clueless, but I'm willing to learn.	no
7818	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K. Well, you'll have to. Right. So anyway, um	no
7819	transcript	transcript_Bed004	N-	no
7820	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So why don't you uh ask Lila	no
7821	transcript	transcript_Bed004	and see what she says about you know exactly what we do for someone in	no
7822	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Student-type worker, or - ?	no
7823	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Well, yeah she's un- she's not a - a student, she just graduated but anyway. So i- if - Yeah, I agree, she sounded fine, she	no
7824	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Hmm.	no
7825	transcript	transcript_Bed004	a- actually was	no
7826	transcript	transcript_Bed004	uh, present and stuff than - than she was in conversation, so she did a	no
7827	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah.	no
7828	transcript	transcript_Bed004	talking to her. So I think that's great.	no
7829	transcript	transcript_Bed004	This is sort of what I	no
7830	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah.	no
7831	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Right.	no
7832	transcript	transcript_Bed004	more thoroughly, this is the information on - on the low- sunken castle, and the amphitheater that never came up,	no
7833	transcript	transcript_Bed004	and um, so i- if we give her even more um, instruments to work with I think the results are gonna be even better.	no
7834	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Oh, yeah, and then of course as she does it she'll - she'll learn	no
7835	transcript	transcript_Bed004	And also if she's willing to take on the job of organizing all those subjects and stuff that would be wonderful.	no
7836	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Mmm.	no
7837	transcript	transcript_Bed004	And, uh	no
7838	transcript	transcript_Bed004	she's - actually she's going to graduate school in a kind of an experimental paradigm, so I think this is all just fine in terms of h- her learning things she's gonna need to know	no
7839	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Mmm.	no
7840	transcript	transcript_Bed004	uh, to do her career. So, I - my guess is she'll be r- r- quite happy to take on that job. And, so -	no
7841	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yep. Yeah she - she	no
7842	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Great.	no
7843	transcript	transcript_Bed004	And um I told her that we gonna um figure out a meeting time in the near future to refine the tasks and s- look for the potential sources to find people.	no
7844	transcript	transcript_Bed004	She also agrees that you know if it's all just gonna be students the data is gonna be less valuable because of that so.	no
7845	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Well,	no
7846	transcript	transcript_Bed004	We're already -	no
7847	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah.	no
7848	transcript	transcript_Bed004	uh -	no
7849	transcript	transcript_Bed004	However, we may run into a problem with a	no
7850	transcript	transcript_Bed004	And um, we'll see.	no
7851	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah. We could talk to the people who run it and um see if they have a way that they could easily uh tell people that there's a task, pays ten bucks or something, but	no
7852	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Mm-hmm. Yeah.	no
7853	transcript	transcript_Bed004	um	no
7854	transcript	transcript_Bed004	you have to be comfortable reading relatively complicated stuff. And - and there'll probably be self-selection to some extent.	no
7855	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Mmm.	no
7856	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yep.	yes
7857	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Uh,	no
7858	transcript	transcript_Bed004	so	no
7859	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K.	no
7860	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Now,	no
7861	transcript	transcript_Bed004	and part of what we should do is this. So,	no
7862	transcript	transcript_Bed004	my idea on that was	no
7863	transcript	transcript_Bed004	uh, partly we'll talk about system stuff for the	no
7864	transcript	transcript_Bed004	in some of this issue about what the	no
7865	transcript	transcript_Bed004	all - um you know, what the	no
7866	transcript	transcript_Bed004	because to the extent that we can get	no
7867	transcript	transcript_Bed004	that will be good.	no
7868	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yep.	no
7869	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So this issue about	no
7870	transcript	transcript_Bed004	you know re-formulating things, maybe we can get some of the linguists sufficiently interested that they'll	no
7871	transcript	transcript_Bed004	uh,	no
7872	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yep.	no
7873	transcript	transcript_Bed004	the linguistics students and stuff.	no
7874	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So my idea on - on Wednesday is	no
7875	transcript	transcript_Bed004	to uh - you - I mean, what you did today would - i- is just	no
7876	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"so forth."""	no
7877	transcript	transcript_Bed004	But then, the	no
7878	transcript	transcript_Bed004	um give the	no
7879	transcript	transcript_Bed004	what's going on with the	no
7880	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yep.	no
7881	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Is - is this	no
7882	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So, I don't - I don't think it's worth	no
7883	transcript	transcript_Bed004	a lot of work, particularly on	no
7884	transcript	transcript_Bed004	you don't have to make	no
7885	transcript	transcript_Bed004	to talk about.	no
7886	transcript	transcript_Bed004	And, then um	no
7887	transcript	transcript_Bed004	just see how a discussion goes.	no
7888	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Mm-hmm.	no
7889	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Sounds good. The uh	no
7890	transcript	transcript_Bed004	other two things is um	no
7891	transcript	transcript_Bed004	we've -	no
7892	transcript	transcript_Bed004	can have Johno tell us a little about this	no
7893	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Great.	no
7894	transcript	transcript_Bed004	and we also have a l- little bit on the interface, M_-three-L_ enhancement, and then um that was	yes
7895	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So, what I did for this - this is - uh, a pedagogical belief-net because	no
7896	transcript	transcript_Bed004	I was - I - I took - I tried to	no
7897	transcript	transcript_Bed004	conceptually do what you were talking about with the nodes that you could expand out - so what I did was I took - I made these dummy nodes called Trajector-In and Trajector-Out that	no
7898	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yep.	no
7899	transcript	transcript_Bed004	would isolate the things related to the trajector. And then there were the things with the source and the path and the goal.	no
7900	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yep.	no
7901	transcript	transcript_Bed004	And I separated them out. And then I um did similar things for our - our net to - uh with the context and the discourse and whatnot,	no
7902	transcript	transcript_Bed004	um, so we could sort of isolate them or whatever in terms of the - the	no
7903	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Mm-hmm.	no
7904	transcript	transcript_Bed004	And then the bottom layer is just the Mode.	no
7905	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So, let's - let's - Yeah, I don't understand it. Let's go -	no
7906	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So.	no
7907	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Slide all the way up so we see what the p- the p-	no
7908	transcript	transcript_Bed004	very	no
7909	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"Yeah, there's just one more node and it says ""Mode"" which is the decision between the -"	no
7910	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah.	no
7911	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K, great. Alright. So -	no
7912	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So basically all I did was I took the last	no
7913	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Mm-hmm.	no
7914	transcript	transcript_Bed004	and I grouped things according to what - how I thought they would fit in to	no
7915	transcript	transcript_Bed004	uh	no
7916	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yep.	no
7917	transcript	transcript_Bed004	were Trajector-landmark and then Source-path-goal as initial ones.	no
7918	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Mm-hmm.	no
7919	transcript	transcript_Bed004	And then I said well, uh the trajector would be the person in this case probably.	no
7920	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Right, yep.	no
7921	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Um,	no
7922	transcript	transcript_Bed004	you know, we have - we have the concept of what their intention was, whether they were trying to tour or do business or whatever,	no
7923	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Right.	no
7924	transcript	transcript_Bed004	or they were hurried.	no
7925	transcript	transcript_Bed004	in terms of the source, the things - uh the only things that we had on there I believe were whether -	no
7926	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Oh actually, I kind of, - I might have added these cuz I don't think we talked too much about the source in the old one but	no
7927	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Mm-hmm.	no
7928	transcript	transcript_Bed004	uh whether the - where I'm	no
7929	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"or the ""landmark-iness"" of where I'm"	no
7930	transcript	transcript_Bed004	something that you'd visit for tourist's - tourism's sake or whatever.	no
7931	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"""Travel constraints"" would be something like"	no
7932	transcript	transcript_Bed004	you know, maybe they said they can - they only wanna take a	no
7933	transcript	transcript_Bed004	And then those are somewhat related to the path, so that would	no
7934	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Mm-hmm.	no
7935	transcript	transcript_Bed004	determine whether we'd - could take - we would be telling them to go to the bus stop or versus walking there directly.	no
7936	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"Um, ""Goal""."	no
7937	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Similar things as the	no
7938	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Um,	no
7939	transcript	transcript_Bed004	and then if you go up,	no
7940	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Robert,	no
7941	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah, so -	no
7942	transcript	transcript_Bed004	um,	no
7943	transcript	transcript_Bed004	in terms of Context, what we had currently said was	no
7944	transcript	transcript_Bed004	whether they were a businessman or a tourist of some other	no
7945	transcript	transcript_Bed004	person.	no
7946	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Um, Discourse was related to whether they had asked about open hours or whether they asked about where the entrance was or the admission fee, or something along those lines.	no
7947	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Mm-hmm.	no
7948	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Uh, Prosody I don't really - I'm not really sure what prosody means, in this context,	no
7949	transcript	transcript_Bed004	so I just made up you know whether - whether what they say is - or h-	no
7950	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Right, O_K.	no
7951	transcript	transcript_Bed004	is - is	no
7952	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Um, the Parse would be what verb they chose, and then maybe how they modified it, in the sense of	no
7953	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"whether they said ""I need to get there quickly"" or whatever."	no
7954	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Mm-hmm.	no
7955	transcript	transcript_Bed004	And um, in terms of World Knowledge, this would just basically be like opening and closing times of things, the time of day it is, and whatnot.	no
7956	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"What's ""tourbook""?"	no
7957	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"Tourbook? That would be, I don't know, the ""landmark-iness"" of things,"	no
7958	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Mm-hmm.	no
7959	transcript	transcript_Bed004	whether it's in the	no
7960	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Ch-ch-ch-ch.	no
7961	transcript	transcript_Bed004	what you	no
7962	transcript	transcript_Bed004	I don't yet understand	no
7963	transcript	transcript_Bed004	a s-	no
7964	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Well, this is not a working Bayes-net.	no
7965	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Right.	no
7966	transcript	transcript_Bed004	No, I	no
7967	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So,	no
7968	transcript	transcript_Bed004	what -	no
7969	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Let's slide back up again and see - start at the - at the	no
7970	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Oop-bo-doop-boop-boop.	no
7971	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So,	no
7972	transcript	transcript_Bed004	you could	no
7973	transcript	transcript_Bed004	w-	no
7974	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Uh,	no
7975	transcript	transcript_Bed004	go ahead, you were about to go up there and	no
7976	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Well I - O_K, I just - Say what you were gonna say. O_K.	no
7977	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Good, do it! No no, go do it.	no
7978	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Uh - I - I'd -	no
7979	transcript	transcript_Bed004	No, I was gonna wait until -	no
7980	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Oh,	no
7981	transcript	transcript_Bed004	that is, you know, with fill - you know, actually f- uh, fill it	no
7982	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So we'd have to get rid of	no
7983	transcript	transcript_Bed004	and connect these things directly to the Mode.	no
7984	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Well, I don't - That's an issue. So, um -	no
7985	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Cuz I don't understand how it would work otherwise.	no
7986	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Well, here's the problem.	no
7987	transcript	transcript_Bed004	And - and uh - Bhaskara and I was talking about this a little earlier today - is, if we just	no
7988	transcript	transcript_Bed004	uh,	no
7989	transcript	transcript_Bed004	combinatoric input to the	no
7990	transcript	transcript_Bed004	And uh -	no
7991	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Well I - oh yeah, I unders- I understand	no
7992	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Well, i- But	no
7993	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K.	no
7994	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K, so, so,	no
7995	transcript	transcript_Bed004	uh.	no
7996	transcript	transcript_Bed004	There - there are a variety of ways of doing it.	no
7997	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Uh. Let me just mention something that I	no
7998	transcript	transcript_Bed004	there are	no
7999	transcript	transcript_Bed004	and - about Noisy-OR's and Noisy-MAXes and	no
8000	transcript	transcript_Bed004	there're ways to	no
8001	transcript	transcript_Bed004	uh sort of back off on the purity of your Bayes-net-edness.	no
8002	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Mmm.	no
8003	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Uh,	no
8004	transcript	transcript_Bed004	so. If you co- you could ima- and I- now I don't	no
8005	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So it's possible that we could do something like a summary node of some sort that -	no
8006	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah.	no
8007	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K.	no
8008	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah.	no
8009	transcript	transcript_Bed004	And, um	no
8010	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So.	no
8011	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So in	no
8012	transcript	transcript_Bed004	some other -	no
8013	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So what I was gonna	no
8014	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah.	no
8015	transcript	transcript_Bed004	is to	no
8016	transcript	transcript_Bed004	try to	no
8017	transcript	transcript_Bed004	but to try to	no
8018	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So, if you have some bottom line	no
8019	transcript	transcript_Bed004	uh decision about which	no
8020	transcript	transcript_Bed004	you know,	no
8021	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Mmm.	no
8022	transcript	transcript_Bed004	And the	no
8023	transcript	transcript_Bed004	is to make the n-	no
8024	transcript	transcript_Bed004	that you don't get this combinatorics. So	no
8025	transcript	transcript_Bed004	that if you decided	no
8026	transcript	transcript_Bed004	that you could characterize the decision as a trade-off between three factors, whatever they may be,	no
8027	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"O_K? then you could say ""Aha, let's have"	no
8028	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K? and maybe a binary version f- for each, or	no
8029	transcript	transcript_Bed004	some relatively compact	no
8030	transcript	transcript_Bed004	decision node just	no
8031	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Mmm.	no
8032	transcript	transcript_Bed004	And	no
8033	transcript	transcript_Bed004	uh can you make a	no
8034	transcript	transcript_Bed004	from the various	no
8035	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So that y-	no
8036	transcript	transcript_Bed004	so that, you know, you can sort of try to do a	no
8037	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K.	no
8038	transcript	transcript_Bed004	uh sort of orthodox	no
8039	transcript	transcript_Bed004	how do we	no
8040	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Um	no
8041	transcript	transcript_Bed004	and	no
8042	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So what I kind of need to do is to take	no
8043	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"""Eh-eh-eh."""	no
8044	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah.	no
8045	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Well,	no
8046	transcript	transcript_Bed004	mmm,	no
8047	transcript	transcript_Bed004	uh,	no
8048	transcript	transcript_Bed004	kicking around, so he may have some good intuition	no
8049	transcript	transcript_Bed004	about	no
8050	transcript	transcript_Bed004	you know, what	no
8051	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Mmm.	no
8052	transcript	transcript_Bed004	and,	no
8053	transcript	transcript_Bed004	um,	no
8054	transcript	transcript_Bed004	I understand where this - the uh -	no
8055	transcript	transcript_Bed004	this is a way of	no
8056	transcript	transcript_Bed004	playing with this abs- Source-path-goal trajector exp- uh uh abstraction and - and sort of sh- displaying it in a particular way.	no
8057	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah.	no
8058	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Uh,	no
8059	transcript	transcript_Bed004	I don't think our friends	no
8060	transcript	transcript_Bed004	uh on Wednesday are going to be able to -	no
8061	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Well,	no
8062	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Um,	no
8063	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Uh,	no
8064	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Well, I think this is still, I mean,	no
8065	transcript	transcript_Bed004	ad-hoc. This is sort of th- the second	no
8066	transcript	transcript_Bed004	you know, a - a - whatever, U_M_L diagram or, you know, as just a uh screen shot,	no
8067	transcript	transcript_Bed004	not really as a Bayes-net as John - Johno said.	no
8068	transcript	transcript_Bed004	We could actually, y- yeah draw it in a different way,	no
8069	transcript	transcript_Bed004	in the sense that it would make it more abstract.	no
8070	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah.	no
8071	transcript	transcript_Bed004	But the uh -	no
8072	transcript	transcript_Bed004	the - the nice thing is that you know, it just	no
8073	transcript	transcript_Bed004	is a - is a visual aid for thinking about these things which has comple-	no
8074	transcript	transcript_Bed004	clearly have to be specified m- more carefully and uh	no
8075	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Alright, well, le- let me think about this some more,	no
8076	transcript	transcript_Bed004	and uh see if we can	no
8077	transcript	transcript_Bed004	find a way to	no
8078	transcript	transcript_Bed004	present this	no
8079	transcript	transcript_Bed004	to this	no
8080	transcript	transcript_Bed004	ultimately we - we may w- w-	no
8081	transcript	transcript_Bed004	we regard this as sort of an exercise in -	no
8082	transcript	transcript_Bed004	in thinking about the problem	no
8083	transcript	transcript_Bed004	and maybe a first version of uh	no
8084	transcript	transcript_Bed004	a	no
8085	transcript	transcript_Bed004	that you can give input and it- it'll uh throw the dice for you,	no
8086	transcript	transcript_Bed004	uh throw the die for you,	no
8087	transcript	transcript_Bed004	I integrated this into the	no
8088	transcript	transcript_Bed004	much the same way we can um	no
8089	transcript	transcript_Bed004	sort of have this uh -	no
8090	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Close this down.	no
8091	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So if this is what M_-three-L_ um	no
8092	transcript	transcript_Bed004	will	no
8093	transcript	transcript_Bed004	um - And a very simple thing. We have an action that he wants to go from somewhere, which is some type of object, to someplace.	no
8094	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Mm-hmm.	no
8095	transcript	transcript_Bed004	And this - these uh - this changed now	no
8096	transcript	transcript_Bed004	um -	no
8097	transcript	transcript_Bed004	It's doing it twice now because it already did it once.	no
8098	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"Um, we'll add some action type, which in this case is ""Approach"""	no
8099	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Mm-hmm.	no
8100	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Good.	no
8101	transcript	transcript_Bed004	and could be, you know, more refined uh	no
8102	transcript	transcript_Bed004	in many ways. Or we can uh	no
8103	transcript	transcript_Bed004	have something where the uh	no
8104	transcript	transcript_Bed004	goal is a public place	no
8105	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"and it will give us then of course an action type of the type ""Enter""."	no
8106	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So this is just based on this one -	no
8107	transcript	transcript_Bed004	um,	no
8108	transcript	transcript_Bed004	on this one feature,	no
8109	transcript	transcript_Bed004	and that's - that's about all you can do.	no
8110	transcript	transcript_Bed004	And so in the f- if this pla- if the object type	no
8111	transcript	transcript_Bed004	um here is - is a m- is a landmark,	no
8112	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"of course it'll be um ""Vista""."	no
8113	transcript	transcript_Bed004	And um	no
8114	transcript	transcript_Bed004	this is about as much as we can	no
8115	transcript	transcript_Bed004	if we don't w- if we want to avoid uh uh a huge combinatorial explosion where we specify	no
8116	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"""O_K, if it's"	no
8117	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K, I'm sorry. You're - you're -	no
8118	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Hmm?	no
8119	transcript	transcript_Bed004	It was	no
8120	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K, so let me see if I understand what you're saying.	no
8121	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So, I - I	no
8122	transcript	transcript_Bed004	uh you can take the M_-three-L_ and	no
8123	transcript	transcript_Bed004	add not - and it w-	no
8124	transcript	transcript_Bed004	and you	no
8125	transcript	transcript_Bed004	um	no
8126	transcript	transcript_Bed004	object types and stuff,	no
8127	transcript	transcript_Bed004	and what I	no
8128	transcript	transcript_Bed004	is add some	no
8129	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"""If it's of type ""Landmark"", then you"	no
8130	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"take - you're gonna take a picture of it."""	no
8131	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Exactly.	no
8132	transcript	transcript_Bed004	F- full stop, I mean, that's what you do.	no
8133	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Ev- every landmark you take a picture of,	no
8134	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Every public place you enter, and statue you want to go as near as possible.	no
8135	transcript	transcript_Bed004	you enter -	no
8136	transcript	transcript_Bed004	You approach.	no
8137	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K.	no
8138	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Uh,	no
8139	transcript	transcript_Bed004	and certainly you can add rules like that to	no
8140	transcript	transcript_Bed004	the existing SmartKom system.	no
8141	transcript	transcript_Bed004	And you just did, right? O_K.	no
8142	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah.	no
8143	transcript	transcript_Bed004	And it - it would do us no good. That - Ultimately.	no
8144	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Ah.	no
8145	transcript	transcript_Bed004	W-	no
8146	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Um,	no
8147	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"that's a - that's another kind of baseline case, that's another sort of thing ""O_K,"	no
8148	transcript	transcript_Bed004	here's a - another kind of minimal	no
8149	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"uh way of tackling this""."	no
8150	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"Add extra properties, a deterministic rule for every property you have an action, ""pppt!"""	no
8151	transcript	transcript_Bed004	You	no
8152	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Um,	no
8153	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Uh	no
8154	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Now, if that's	no
8155	transcript	transcript_Bed004	then you can get the types from the	no
8156	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K? because	no
8157	transcript	transcript_Bed004	that's all - you're - all you're	no
8158	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Hmm?	no
8159	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Right? So we don't - we don't use the	no
8160	transcript	transcript_Bed004	No.	no
8161	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Alright, but that's -	no
8162	transcript	transcript_Bed004	but that's O_K, and I mean it- it's again a kind of	no
8163	transcript	transcript_Bed004	one minimal extension	no
8164	transcript	transcript_Bed004	of the existing things.	no
8165	transcript	transcript_Bed004	And that's something the uh	no
8166	transcript	transcript_Bed004	SmartKom people	no
8167	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah.	no
8168	transcript	transcript_Bed004	No. And this is - just in order to exemplify what - what we can do very, very easily is, um we have	no
8169	transcript	transcript_Bed004	this - this silly	no
8170	transcript	transcript_Bed004	uh interface and we have	no
8171	transcript	transcript_Bed004	the rules that are as banal as	no
8172	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Hmm.	no
8173	transcript	transcript_Bed004	I - whi- which is sort of what - what we see	no
8174	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah.	no
8175	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah.	no
8176	transcript	transcript_Bed004	um be um a job to find ways of writing down	no
8177	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Image schema, X_schema, constructions, in some - some form,	no
8178	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"and have this be in a - in a - in the content, loosely called ""Constructicon""."	no
8179	transcript	transcript_Bed004	And the	no
8180	transcript	transcript_Bed004	And um - and here is exactly where what's gonna be replaced with our Bayes-net, which is exactly getting the input feeding into here.	no
8181	transcript	transcript_Bed004	whether it's an- whether action - the - the Enter, the Vista,	no
8182	transcript	transcript_Bed004	or the whatever	no
8183	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"Uh, """	no
8184	transcript	transcript_Bed004	uh	no
8185	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Approach um construction should be activated,	no
8186	transcript	transcript_Bed004	That's what you	no
8187	transcript	transcript_Bed004	I_E just pasted in.	no
8188	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Right. But it's	no
8189	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah.	no
8190	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Right. This is uh - so what we'd be generating would be	no
8191	transcript	transcript_Bed004	a reference to a semantic	no
8192	transcript	transcript_Bed004	uh like parameters for the -	no
8193	transcript	transcript_Bed004	For - for - for -	no
8194	transcript	transcript_Bed004	for the X_schema?	no
8195	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yes.	no
8196	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K.	no
8197	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah.	no
8198	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So that - that uh i- if you had the	no
8199	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"generalized ""Go"" X_schema and you wanted to specialize it to these three ones, then you would have to supply the parameters."	no
8200	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Right.	no
8201	transcript	transcript_Bed004	And	no
8202	transcript	transcript_Bed004	uh, although we haven't worried about this yet, you might wanna worry about something that would	no
8203	transcript	transcript_Bed004	go to the G_I_S	no
8204	transcript	transcript_Bed004	and use that to actually get	no
8205	transcript	transcript_Bed004	you know, detailed route planning. So, you know, where do you do take a picture of it and stuff like that.	no
8206	transcript	transcript_Bed004	But that's	no
8207	transcript	transcript_Bed004	not - It's not the	no
8208	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Right.	no
8209	transcript	transcript_Bed004	But, presumably that - that - that functionality's there when - when we -	no
8210	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So the immediate problem is just deciding w-	no
8211	transcript	transcript_Bed004	which -	no
8212	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Aspects of the X_schema to add.	no
8213	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah.	no
8214	transcript	transcript_Bed004	uh what are we going to use to make this decision -	no
8215	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Right and then, once we've made the decision, how do we put that into the content?	no
8216	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah.	no
8217	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Right.	no
8218	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Right. Well,	no
8219	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K.	no
8220	transcript	transcript_Bed004	The	no
8221	transcript	transcript_Bed004	we decide what we want to	no
8222	transcript	transcript_Bed004	And	no
8223	transcript	transcript_Bed004	how are you going to	no
8224	transcript	transcript_Bed004	from some combination of the -	no
8225	transcript	transcript_Bed004	what the person says and the context and the ontology.	no
8226	transcript	transcript_Bed004	The h-	no
8227	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So, I think that's the hardest problem at the moment is - is	no
8228	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K.	no
8229	transcript	transcript_Bed004	where are you gonna - how are you gonna g-	no
8230	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Um, and that's - so, getting back to here, uh, we have a d- a technical problem with the belief-nets that we - we	no
8231	transcript	transcript_Bed004	don't want all the com-	no
8232	transcript	transcript_Bed004	There's just too many factors right now.	no
8233	transcript	transcript_Bed004	too many factors if we - if we allow them to just go combinatorially.	no
8234	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Right.	no
8235	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So we wanna think about which ones we really care about	no
8236	transcript	transcript_Bed004	and what they	no
8237	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So what we really wanna do i- cuz this is really just the three layer	no
8238	transcript	transcript_Bed004	net, we wanna b-	no
8239	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Right.	no
8240	transcript	transcript_Bed004	make it - expand it out into more layers basically?	no
8241	transcript	transcript_Bed004	We	no
8242	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Uh,	no
8243	transcript	transcript_Bed004	I mean that - that's certainly one thing we can do. Uh, it's true that	no
8244	transcript	transcript_Bed004	the way you have this,	no
8245	transcript	transcript_Bed004	a lot of the times you have -	no
8246	transcript	transcript_Bed004	what you're having is the	no
8247	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So uh -	no
8248	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Right.	no
8249	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K? So you -	no
8250	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"So instead of in- instead it should really be - just be ""intention"" as a node instead of ""intention business"" or ""intention tour""."	no
8251	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"Yeah, right, and then it would have values, uh, ""Tour"", ""Business"", or uh ""Hurried""."	no
8252	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Right.	no
8253	transcript	transcript_Bed004	But then - but i- it still some knowledge design to do, about i- how do you wanna break this up, what really matters.	no
8254	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Right.	no
8255	transcript	transcript_Bed004	I mean, it's fine.	no
8256	transcript	transcript_Bed004	You know, we have to - it's - it's iterative. We're gonna have to work with it some.	no
8257	transcript	transcript_Bed004	I think what was going through my mind when I did it was someone could both have	no
8258	transcript	transcript_Bed004	a business intention and a touring intention and	no
8259	transcript	transcript_Bed004	the probabilities of	no
8260	transcript	transcript_Bed004	both of them happening at the same time -	no
8261	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Well, you - you could	no
8262	transcript	transcript_Bed004	um, they add up to	no
8263	transcript	transcript_Bed004	but that there's uh - that - that it doesn't have to be one zero	no
8264	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Mmm. O_K.	no
8265	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K. So you could have the conditional p-	no
8266	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So the -	no
8267	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So whenever there's a choice,	no
8268	transcript	transcript_Bed004	uh -	no
8269	transcript	transcript_Bed004	so like	no
8270	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Well, see I don't think	no
8271	transcript	transcript_Bed004	it seems like something could both be -	no
8272	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Absolutely right.	no
8273	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K.	no
8274	transcript	transcript_Bed004	And so that you might want to then have those b-	no
8275	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Th- Then they may have to be separate. They may not be able to be values of the same	no
8276	transcript	transcript_Bed004	variable.	no
8277	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Object type, mm-hmm.	no
8278	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So that's - but again, this is - this is the sort of knowledge design you have to go through.	no
8279	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah, this is just more	no
8280	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"me taking last - the last one, and saying ""how can I formalize this?"""	no
8281	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Right.	no
8282	transcript	transcript_Bed004	It's - you know, it's great - is - is, you know, as one step toward uh -	no
8283	transcript	transcript_Bed004	toward where we wanna go.	no
8284	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Also it strikes me that we - we m- may want to approach the point where we can sort of try to find a -	no
8285	transcript	transcript_Bed004	uh, a specification for some interface, here that um	no
8286	transcript	transcript_Bed004	takes the normal M_-three-L_, looks at it. Then we discussed in our pre-edu - E_D_U meeting um how to ask the ontology, what to ask the ontology	no
8287	transcript	transcript_Bed004	um the fact that we can pretend we have one, make a dummy until we get the	no
8288	transcript	transcript_Bed004	and so um we -	no
8289	transcript	transcript_Bed004	we	no
8290	transcript	transcript_Bed004	you know if we have a - a - a belief-net interface.	no
8291	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So the belief-net takes as input, a vector, right?	no
8292	transcript	transcript_Bed004	of stuff.	no
8293	transcript	transcript_Bed004	And it -	no
8294	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah.	no
8295	transcript	transcript_Bed004	And um it- Output is whatever,	no
8296	transcript	transcript_Bed004	as well.	no
8297	transcript	transcript_Bed004	But this information is just M_-three-L_,	no
8298	transcript	transcript_Bed004	and then we want to look up some more stuff in the ontology and we want to look up some more stuff	no
8299	transcript	transcript_Bed004	in the - maybe we want to ask the real world, maybe you want to look something up in the G_R_S, but also we definitely want to	no
8300	transcript	transcript_Bed004	look up in the dialogue history um some s- some stuff. Based on we - we have uh - I was just made some examples from the ontology	no
8301	transcript	transcript_Bed004	and so we have for example some information there that the town hall is both a - a - a building and it has doors and stuff like this, but it is also an institution, so it has a mayor and so forth and so forth	no
8302	transcript	transcript_Bed004	and we get relations out of it and once we	no
8303	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Mm-hmm.	no
8304	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Right.	no
8305	transcript	transcript_Bed004	and so forth, and maybe draw some inferences on that. So this may be a - a sort of a process of two to three steps before we get our vector, that we feed into the belief-net, and then -	no
8306	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah. I think that's - I think that's exactly right.	no
8307	transcript	transcript_Bed004	There	no
8308	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah.	no
8309	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah, no I think that's - that's just fine.	no
8310	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Uh,	no
8311	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"a thread or process or something that ""Agent"","	no
8312	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"yeah, ""Agent"", whatever you wan- wanna say, yeah,"	no
8313	transcript	transcript_Bed004	that uh is rule-driven, and can - can uh -	no
8314	transcript	transcript_Bed004	can do things like that. And um there's an issue about whether there will be - that'll be the	no
8315	transcript	transcript_Bed004	My guess is it'll be the same basic agent that um	no
8316	transcript	transcript_Bed004	can go off and get information,	no
8317	transcript	transcript_Bed004	run it through a - a c- this belief-net that -	no
8318	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Turn the crank, yeah.	no
8319	transcript	transcript_Bed004	turn a crank in the belief-net, that'll come out with s-	no
8320	transcript	transcript_Bed004	uh more - another vector,	no
8321	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K,	no
8322	transcript	transcript_Bed004	which can then be	no
8323	transcript	transcript_Bed004	uh applied	no
8324	transcript	transcript_Bed004	at what we would call the simulation or action end. So you now know what you're gonna do and	no
8325	transcript	transcript_Bed004	that may actually involve getting	no
8326	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Mmm.	no
8327	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K? Now that we	no
8328	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K? we didn't - We didn't need to know beforehand, uh how long the bus trip takes or whatever, but - but now that	no
8329	transcript	transcript_Bed004	we	no
8330	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So this is actually, s- if - if we	no
8331	transcript	transcript_Bed004	is um,	no
8332	transcript	transcript_Bed004	and, uh, I had one more thing,	no
8333	transcript	transcript_Bed004	the -	no
8334	transcript	transcript_Bed004	it needs to do -	no
8335	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah.	no
8336	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"I think we - I - I can come up with a - a code for a module that we call the ""cognitive dispatcher"","	no
8337	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K.	no
8338	transcript	transcript_Bed004	which does nothing, but it looks	no
8339	transcript	transcript_Bed004	uh sub-objects and then	no
8340	transcript	transcript_Bed004	recombine them and put them together.	no
8341	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So maybe this is actually some - some useful tool that we can use to rewrite it,	no
8342	transcript	transcript_Bed004	and uh	no
8343	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Oh, O_K. Uh.	no
8344	transcript	transcript_Bed004	get this part, then. Yeah.	no
8345	transcript	transcript_Bed004	I confess, I'm still	no
8346	transcript	transcript_Bed004	not completely comfortable with the overall story. Um.	no
8347	transcript	transcript_Bed004	I-	no
8348	transcript	transcript_Bed004	i- This - this is not a complaint, this is a promise to do more work.	no
8349	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So I'm gonna hafta think about it some more. Um.	no
8350	transcript	transcript_Bed004	In particular -	no
8351	transcript	transcript_Bed004	see what we'd	no
8352	transcript	transcript_Bed004	and - and this has been implicit in the discussion,	no
8353	transcript	transcript_Bed004	is to	no
8354	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So. What you're trying to get out of this deep co- cognitive linguistics	no
8355	transcript	transcript_Bed004	is the fact that w- if you know about source - source,	no
8356	transcript	transcript_Bed004	that a	no
8357	transcript	transcript_Bed004	for different tasks. And that -	no
8358	transcript	transcript_Bed004	uh there's - there's some - some important generalities that you're	no
8359	transcript	transcript_Bed004	And I don't	no
8360	transcript	transcript_Bed004	There're no primitives upon which	no
8361	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Alright.	no
8362	transcript	transcript_Bed004	u- u-	no
8363	transcript	transcript_Bed004	What are the primitives, and how do you break this -	no
8364	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So I y- I'm just -	no
8365	transcript	transcript_Bed004	just there saying eee	no
8366	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Right.	no
8367	transcript	transcript_Bed004	right? but I	no
8368	transcript	transcript_Bed004	uh cognitive	no
8369	transcript	transcript_Bed004	And um	no
8370	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yep.	no
8371	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"Maybe we sho- should we a- add then the ""what's this?"""	no
8372	transcript	transcript_Bed004	domain?	no
8373	transcript	transcript_Bed004	N-	no
8374	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"I mean, we have to ""how do I get to X_""."	no
8375	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"Then we also have the ""what's this?"" domain,"	no
8376	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Right.	no
8377	transcript	transcript_Bed004	where we get some slightly different -	no
8378	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Um	no
8379	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah.	no
8380	transcript	transcript_Bed004	I didn't	no
8381	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Well, I -	no
8382	transcript	transcript_Bed004	It uh -	no
8383	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"But um, I'm sure the ""what's this?"" questions also create some interesting X_schema aspects."	no
8384	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Could be. I'm not a - I'm not op- particularly opposed to adding that or any other task, I mean, eventually we're gonna want a whole range of them.	no
8385	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So.	no
8386	transcript	transcript_Bed004	That's right.	no
8387	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Uh,	no
8388	transcript	transcript_Bed004	I'm just saying that	no
8389	transcript	transcript_Bed004	I'm gonna hafta do some sort of first principles thinking about this. I just at the moment don't know. H-	no
8390	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"Do you mean in the sense of ""is there a way we can generalize the Bayes-net"", or -"	no
8391	transcript	transcript_Bed004	No. Well, no the Bayes - the Bayes-nets -	no
8392	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Seems like it has to be specific.	no
8393	transcript	transcript_Bed004	The Bayes-nets will be dec- specific for each decision. But what I'd like to be able to do	no
8394	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K.	no
8395	transcript	transcript_Bed004	is to have the way that you extract properties,	no
8396	transcript	transcript_Bed004	that will go into different Bayes-nets, be	no
8397	transcript	transcript_Bed004	the - uh	no
8398	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Mm-hmm.	no
8399	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So that if you have sources, you have trajectors and stuff like that, and there's a language for	no
8400	transcript	transcript_Bed004	you	no
8401	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Right. O_K.	no
8402	transcript	transcript_Bed004	for uh uh going to something, than for circling it, for uh telling someone else how to go there,	no
8403	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Getting out of -	no
8404	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So that - that, the -	no
8405	transcript	transcript_Bed004	the	no
8406	transcript	transcript_Bed004	What you'd	no
8407	transcript	transcript_Bed004	um a kind of intermediate representation which looks the same o- over a bunch of inputs and a bunch of outputs.	no
8408	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So all sorts of different tasks	no
8409	transcript	transcript_Bed004	and all sorts of different ways of	no
8410	transcript	transcript_Bed004	And	no
8411	transcript	transcript_Bed004	that's - that would be the really	no
8412	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Right.	no
8413	transcript	transcript_Bed004	And	no
8414	transcript	transcript_Bed004	pushing it one step further, when you get to construction grammar and stuff, what you'd like to be able to do is say you have this	no
8415	transcript	transcript_Bed004	uh SmartKom, i- that - that actually	no
8416	transcript	transcript_Bed004	The SmartKom.	no
8417	transcript	transcript_Bed004	that there's uh something about the intent - you know, the actual what people wanna do or what they're referring to and stuff,	no
8418	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Mm-hmm.	no
8419	transcript	transcript_Bed004	in- independent of	no
8420	transcript	transcript_Bed004	whether it - about - what is this or where is it or something,	no
8421	transcript	transcript_Bed004	that you could tell	no
8422	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Somehow you'd know that you needed to find out whether there - something was a landmark or something like that?	no
8423	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So that's the -	no
8424	transcript	transcript_Bed004	You	no
8425	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah.	no
8426	transcript	transcript_Bed004	You might.	no
8427	transcript	transcript_Bed004	You might be able to - to uh	no
8428	transcript	transcript_Bed004	say that this i- this is the	no
8429	transcript	transcript_Bed004	in which the -	no
8430	transcript	transcript_Bed004	there's - Let's say there's a uh cont-	no
8431	transcript	transcript_Bed004	there - the - the land-	no
8432	transcript	transcript_Bed004	the construction	no
8433	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Mmm.	no
8434	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K.	no
8435	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So just from this local construction	no
8436	transcript	transcript_Bed004	you know that you're gonna	no
8437	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"So if you say ""how do I get"	no
8438	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K,	no
8439	transcript	transcript_Bed004	then um -	no
8440	transcript	transcript_Bed004	that involve the castle as a	no
8441	transcript	transcript_Bed004	and you'd	no
8442	transcript	transcript_Bed004	you crank up the appropriate stuff.	no
8443	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Right.	no
8444	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Independent of what the	no
8445	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Alright, so that's - that's the - that's the thesis level uh -	no
8446	transcript	transcript_Bed004	It's unfortunate also that English has sort of got rid of most of its spatial adverbs	no
8447	transcript	transcript_Bed004	because they're really fancy then, in - in -	no
8448	transcript	transcript_Bed004	for these kinds of analysis.	no
8449	transcript	transcript_Bed004	But uh.	no
8450	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Well, you have prepositional phrases that -	no
8451	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah, but they're - they're easier for	no
8452	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Right.	no
8453	transcript	transcript_Bed004	they have a tough time. Because the -	no
8454	transcript	transcript_Bed004	mean- the semantics are very complex in that.	no
8455	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Right.	no
8456	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K, yeah?	no
8457	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Oh yeah, b- But an architecture like this would also enable us maybe to - to throw this away and - and replace it with something else, or whatever, so that we have - so that this is sort of the representational formats we're - we're - we're talking about that are independent of the problem,	no
8458	transcript	transcript_Bed004	that generalize over those problems, and are	no
8459	transcript	transcript_Bed004	oh, t- of a higher quality than an- any actual whatever um	no
8460	transcript	transcript_Bed004	belief-net, or	no
8461	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"""X_"" that we may use for the decision making,"	no
8462	transcript	transcript_Bed004	ultimately.	no
8463	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Should be decoupled, yeah.	no
8464	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K.	no
8465	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Right.	yes
8466	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So, are we gonna be meeting	no
8467	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah, um, Liz also asks whether we're gonna have presentations	no
8468	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Right.	no
8469	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Oh yeah. No I -	no
8470	transcript	transcript_Bed004	I think it's worth it	no
8471	transcript	transcript_Bed004	to ass- to meet here	no
8472	transcript	transcript_Bed004	to bring this, and assume that something may come	no
8473	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah.	no
8474	transcript	transcript_Bed004	I mean. Why not.	no
8475	transcript	transcript_Bed004	And um.	no
8476	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah, that was my -	yes
8477	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah, that was my -	no
8478	transcript	transcript_Bed004	She was	no
8479	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah? The uh - um, she w- she was	no
8480	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Right.	no
8481	transcript	transcript_Bed004	and um	no
8482	transcript	transcript_Bed004	also the um -	no
8483	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Right.	no
8484	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah, and - and - and - yeah and - and she took it seriously and stuff l- No, it was great.	no
8485	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah.	no
8486	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah.	no
8487	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So	no
8488	transcript	transcript_Bed004	for example, is, you know,	no
8489	transcript	transcript_Bed004	she actually m- said - you know,	no
8490	transcript	transcript_Bed004	she never s- just spoke about entering, she just wanted to get someplace, and she said for buying stuff.	no
8491	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Nuh?	no
8492	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So this is definitely interesting, and -	no
8493	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah, right.	no
8494	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Um, and in the other case, where she wanted to look at the stuff at the graffiti,	no
8495	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Nuh?	no
8496	transcript	transcript_Bed004	except that there was a nice anaphora,	no
8497	transcript	transcript_Bed004	you know,	no
8498	transcript	transcript_Bed004	for pointing at what she talked about	no
8499	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Right.	no
8500	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"Actually, you'd need a lot of world knowledge. This would have been a classical um uh ""Tango"", actually. Um,"	no
8501	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah.	no
8502	transcript	transcript_Bed004	because graffiti is usually found on the	no
8503	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K.	no
8504	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So the mistake	no
8505	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yep.	no
8506	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Click?	no
8507	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Alright.	yes
8508	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	st-	no
8509	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
8510	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So we're on.	no
8511	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	That's better.	no
8512	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And,	no
8513	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I think the most important thing is Morgan wanted to talk about, uh,	no
8514	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the ARPA	no
8515	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, so,	no
8516	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	here's the thing.	no
8517	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Um,	no
8518	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	why don't we s- again start off with - with, uh,	no
8519	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	-n-	no
8520	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah, I'll get it.	no
8521	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I'll get the door.	no
8522	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Um,	no
8523	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I think we want to start off with the	no
8524	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And then, given that,	no
8525	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh, Liz and Andreas are gonna be	no
8526	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	we can try to figure out what we can	no
8527	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	do most effectively without them here. So -	no
8528	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K. So, uh -	no
8529	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So - so, one thing is, yeah, talk about demo,	no
8530	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh, I_B_M transcription status,	no
8531	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I_B_M transcription.	no
8532	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Uh, what else?	no
8533	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	SmartKom.	no
8534	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	SmartKom.	no
8535	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	SmartKom.	no
8536	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	What's SmartKom?	no
8537	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Uh, we wanna talk about	no
8538	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	if w-	no
8539	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	The data.	no
8540	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	The data which we are collecting here.	no
8541	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	What - what - what are we collecting here?	no
8542	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Data?	no
8543	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So why don't we have that on the agenda and we'll - we'll get to it and talk about it?	no
8544	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah, right.	no
8545	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
8546	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Uh,	no
8547	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	right.	no
8548	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Uh.	no
8549	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Uh, reorganization status.	no
8550	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Reorganization	no
8551	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	status.	no
8552	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Oh.	no
8553	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Files and directories?	no
8554	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Files and directories.	no
8555	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yep.	no
8556	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Uh-huh.	no
8557	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Absinthe,	no
8558	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	which is the multiprocessor UNIX -	no
8559	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Linux.	no
8560	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I think it was	no
8561	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Um -	no
8562	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And then if ti- if there's	no
8563	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K.	no
8564	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, let's see.	no
8565	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I think the a- certainly the segmentation and recognition we wanna maybe focus on when An- Andreas is here since that was particularly his	no
8566	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And also the SmartKom	no
8567	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	thing.	no
8568	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	thing	no
8569	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	SmartKom also,	no
8570	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	should	no
8571	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	b-	no
8572	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Andreas.	no
8573	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Absinthe, I think also he	no
8574	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	has sort of been involved in a lot of those things. Yeah.	no
8575	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	At least,	no
8576	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But.	no
8577	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
8578	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Um	no
8579	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So, I mean, I think they'll be inter- I'll be interested in all this, but -	no
8580	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	but, uh, probably,	no
8581	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	if we had to pick	no
8582	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	ten minutes or so while they're coming here. Or I guess it would be,	no
8583	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	you think, reorganization status, or - ?	yes
8584	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	you think, reorganization status, or - ?	no
8585	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah. I mean, I think,	no
8586	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Chuck was the one who	no
8587	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	added out the agenda item. I don't really have anything to	no
8588	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So.	no
8589	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, I mean, I uh -	no
8590	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	just basically that -	no
8591	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	maybe I said - maybe we said this before - just that we met and we talked about it and	no
8592	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	we	no
8593	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	sort of have a plan for	no
8594	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	getting things organized and -	no
8595	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And I - and I think a crucial part of that is the idea of - of not wanting to do it until right before the next level zero back-up	no
8596	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	so that there won't be huge number of -	no
8597	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
8598	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	of added, uh -	no
8599	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
8600	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	That - that was basically it. Not - not much	no
8601	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Although Dave basically said	no
8602	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
8603	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	that	no
8604	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	if we wanna	no
8605	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Uh-huh.	no
8606	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	just	no
8607	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	do a d- level zero then.	no
8608	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So.	no
8609	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Oh, so maybe we	no
8610	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Oh, good.	no
8611	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yep.	no
8612	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So, I think we	no
8613	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, we don't need to do it during this meeting. We have a	no
8614	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
8615	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But, uh,	no
8616	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	we're - we're basically ready to do it.	no
8617	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And, uh, I have some web pages on	no
8618	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	ts-	no
8619	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	more of the background.	no
8620	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So, naming conventions and things like that, that I've been trying to keep actually up to date.	no
8621	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So.	no
8622	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And I've been	no
8623	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K.	no
8624	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, maybe uh,	no
8625	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	since that - that was a pretty short one, maybe we should talk about the I_B_M transcription status. Someone can	no
8626	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	fill in Liz and Andreas later. Uh	yes
8627	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	fill in Liz and Andreas later. Uh	no
8628	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K. So, we, uh -	no
8629	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	we did another version of the beeps, where we separated each beeps with a spoken digit.	no
8630	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Chuck came up here and recorded some di- himself speaking some digits,	no
8631	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and so it just	no
8632	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	"goes ""beep one beep"" and then the phrase, and then ""beep two beep"" and then the phrase."	no
8633	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And that seems pretty good.	no
8634	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Um,	no
8635	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I think	no
8636	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	they'll have a b- easier time keeping track of where they are in the file.	no
8637	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And we have done that on the	no
8638	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	segmentations.	no
8639	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And we did it with the automatic segmentation, and I don't think - We ne- we didn't look at it in detail.	no
8640	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	We just sent it to I_B_M. We - we sorta	no
8641	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I listened to	no
8642	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
8643	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh, five or ten minutes of it from the beginning.	no
8644	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Oh, really? O_K.	no
8645	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
8646	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And -	no
8647	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I sorta spot-checked here and there and it sounded pretty good.	no
8648	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So.	no
8649	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I think it'll work.	no
8650	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And, uh, we'll just hafta	no
8651	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	see what we get back from them.	no
8652	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Uh -	no
8653	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And the main thing will be	no
8654	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	if we can	no
8655	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	with what we sent them.	no
8656	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I mean, that's the crucial	no
8657	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	part.	no
8658	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
8659	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And I think	no
8660	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	we'll be able to do that at - with this new	no
8661	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	beep	no
8662	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	format.	no
8663	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yep.	no
8664	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, I think	no
8665	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	it's also	no
8666	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	they are	no
8667	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	much less likely to d- have errors.	no
8668	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	no
8669	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I mean, so the problem wi- last time is that there were errors in the transcripts where they	no
8670	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
8671	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	or - and they put in extraneous beeps.	no
8672	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
8673	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And with the numbers there, it's much less likely.	no
8674	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah, one	no
8675	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	interesting note is -	no
8676	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh, or problem - I dunno if this was just	no
8677	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	because of how	no
8678	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	every once in a while,	no
8679	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah. Into two pieces. Yeah.	no
8680	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah, and	no
8681	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yep.	no
8682	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I - I dunno if that's an, uh, artifact of playback -	no
8683	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	bu- uh, I don't think it's probably in the original file.	no
8684	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Um,	no
8685	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I recognize that, too.	no
8686	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
8687	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	but, uh -	no
8688	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Ha. That's interesting. I didn't hear that.	no
8689	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
8690	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But with this new format,	no
8691	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um,	no
8692	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	that	no
8693	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	hopefully	no
8694	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yep.	no
8695	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So.	no
8696	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, maybe we better listen to it again, make sure, but,	no
8697	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I mean, certainly the software shouldn't	no
8698	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	do that, so.	no
8699	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah. That's what I thought. I- it's probably just,	no
8700	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	no
8701	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	you know,	no
8702	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	mmm, somehow the	no
8703	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	audio	no
8704	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	gets	no
8705	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah. Some latency or something. Yeah?	no
8706	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Hiccups.	no
8707	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	hung for a second, or -	no
8708	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
8709	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	As long as they have one number,	no
8710	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and they know that there's only one beep maximum	no
8711	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
8712	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
8713	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	that goes with that number.	no
8714	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah. The only - the only part that might be confusing is when Chuck is reading digits.	no
8715	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
8716	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yep.	no
8717	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
8718	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, you know,	no
8719	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	"""Seven four eight"	no
8720	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	are we having them -	no
8721	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah, but are we having them do digits?	no
8722	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yes.	no
8723	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Because, uh, we don't -	no
8724	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	We - we didn't cut those out.	no
8725	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
8726	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	we didn't -	no
8727	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	They are not transcribed yet. So. Yeah.	no
8728	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	In order to cut them out we'd have to listen to it.	no
8729	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
8730	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And we wanted to avoid doing that, so we - they are transcribing the digits.	no
8731	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K.	no
8732	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Although we	no
8733	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	We can - we can ignore it	no
8734	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	when we get it back, huh.	no
8735	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	we could tell them,	no
8736	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	if you hear someone reading a digits string just say	no
8737	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	"""bracket digit bracket"" and don't bother actually"	no
8738	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	computing the di-	no
8739	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	writing down the digits.	no
8740	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
8741	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	That'd be great. That'd be what I'm having	no
8742	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the transcribers here do, cuz it can be	no
8743	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	extracted later.	yes
8744	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yep.	no
8745	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And then I wanted to	no
8746	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	but as I said I - we may not have	no
8747	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	what we should	no
8748	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Le- let's talk about it, because	no
8749	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	that's - that's something that I - I know Andreas is less interested in than Liz is, so,	no
8750	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K.	no
8751	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	you know.	no
8752	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Do we have anything else to say about transcription?	no
8753	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	It's good -	no
8754	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	About I_B_M stuff?	no
8755	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Uh, Brian - I -	no
8756	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I	no
8757	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and I haven't heard back yet.	no
8758	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So.	no
8759	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K.	no
8760	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I g- hope he got it and hopefully he's -	no
8761	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Hmm.	no
8762	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	maybe he's gone, I dunno. He didn't	no
8763	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	even reply to my message. So.	no
8764	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I should probably ping him just to make sure that	no
8765	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	he got it.	no
8766	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So, we have a whole bunch of digits,	no
8767	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	if we wanna move on to digits.	no
8768	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Actually, maybe I - One - one relate- more related thing in transcription. So that's the I_B_M stuff. We've got that sorted out.	no
8769	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Um, how're we doing on the - on the rest of it?	no
8770	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	We're doing well.	no
8771	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I - I hire - I've hired	no
8772	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Hmm.	no
8773	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And, um,	no
8774	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I've prepared,	no
8775	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um,	no
8776	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh, a set of	no
8777	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	which are now being edited by my head transcriber,	no
8778	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	in terms of spelling errors and all that. She's also checking through and mar- and -	no
8779	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and monitoring, um,	no
8780	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the transcription of	no
8781	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	another transcriber.	no
8782	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	You know, I mean, she's going through and doing these kinds of checks.	no
8783	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Uh-huh.	no
8784	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And,	no
8785	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I've moved on now to what I'm calling set three. I sort of thought if I do it in sets - groups of five,	no
8786	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	then I can have, like, sort of a -	no
8787	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	a parallel processing through - through the -	no
8788	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Uh-huh.	no
8789	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the current.	no
8790	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And -	no
8791	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and you indicated to me that we have a g- a	no
8792	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	for the -	no
8793	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	for the,	no
8794	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um,	no
8795	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the, uh, DARPA	no
8796	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	of twenty hours.	no
8797	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So, I'm gonna go up to twenty hours,	no
8798	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	be sure that everything gets processed,	no
8799	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and released,	no
8800	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and -	no
8801	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and that's -	no
8802	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	that's what my goal is. Package of twenty hours right now,	no
8803	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and then once that's done, move on to the next.	no
8804	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah, uh,	no
8805	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	so twenty hours. But I guess the other thing is that,	no
8806	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um,	no
8807	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	that - that's kinda twenty hours A_SAP because	no
8808	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the longer	no
8809	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	cool things with it.	no
8810	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	no
8811	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So.	no
8812	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Good.	no
8813	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I'm - I'm hiring people who,	no
8814	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh,	no
8815	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	They would like to do it full-time, several of these people.	no
8816	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	no
8817	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And - and I don't think it's	no
8818	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	possible, really, to do this full-time, but,	no
8819	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	that - what it shows is motivation to do as many hours as possible.	no
8820	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	It'll keep your accuracy up.	no
8821	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yep.	no
8822	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
8823	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
8824	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And they're really excellent.	no
8825	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, that's good.	no
8826	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
8827	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah, I mean, I guess the -	no
8828	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Got a good core group now.	no
8829	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So the difference if - if, um,	no
8830	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	if the I_B_M stuff works out,	no
8831	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Again.	no
8832	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the difference in the job would be that they p- primarily would be	no
8833	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	checking through things that were	no
8834	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	no
8835	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	already done by someone else? Is that most of what it - ?	no
8836	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And correcting.	no
8837	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Correcting.	no
8838	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Correcting. We'll - we'll expect that they'll have to move some time bins and do some corrections.	no
8839	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And I - you know, I've also d- uh, discovered -	no
8840	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So with the new transcriber I'm -	no
8841	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um -	no
8842	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So -	no
8843	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Uh, lemme say that	no
8844	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	my,	no
8845	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh -	no
8846	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So,	no
8847	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um -	no
8848	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	At present, um, the people have been doing these transcriptions a channel at a time.	no
8849	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And, that sort of, um,	no
8850	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K. Well,	no
8851	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I realize that, um,	no
8852	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	w- i- we- we're using the pre-segmented version,	no
8853	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and, um,	no
8854	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the pre-segmented version is extremely useful,	no
8855	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and wouldn't it be,	no
8856	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	useful also to have the	no
8857	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And so I've -	no
8858	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh, uh, I've	no
8859	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh, the new- the newest one,	no
8860	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	to, um,	no
8861	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	use the	no
8862	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	visual from	no
8863	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the channel that is gonna be transcribed at any given time.	no
8864	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And that's just	no
8865	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Because what happens	no
8866	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Oh, right. I see what you mean.	no
8867	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And that'll be something like -	no
8868	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I- it's	no
8869	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	A backchannel, or -	no
8870	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Once in a while it's a backchannel. Sometimes it seems to be,	no
8871	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yep.	no
8872	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um,	no
8873	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	no
8874	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And they're rare events, but you can	no
8875	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	you know,	no
8876	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	yo- you s-	no
8877	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	you	no
8878	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And,	no
8879	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I think that we're gonna end up with, uh	no
8880	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	but at the same time we're benefitting	no
8881	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	tremendously from the pre-segmentation because	no
8882	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	there are	no
8883	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	no	no
8884	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	activity at all.	no
8885	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	no
8886	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And, uh, the audio quality is	no
8887	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So they can - they can, um,	no
8888	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	scroll through that pretty quick?	no
8889	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
8890	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	no
8891	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	That's great.	no
8892	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
8893	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So I think that that's gonna,	no
8894	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	also	no
8895	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	part of the process.	no
8896	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Hmm. O_K.	no
8897	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Uh, yeah.	no
8898	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So, uh -	no
8899	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah. So let's talk about the digits, since they're not here yet.	yes
8900	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah. So let's talk about the digits, since they're not here yet.	no
8901	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Uh, so,	no
8902	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	we have a whole bunch of digits that we've read and we have the forms and so on,	no
8903	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um, but only a small number of that ha-	no
8904	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	well, not a	no
8905	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	only	no
8906	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	a	no
8907	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	what we wanna	no
8908	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And, uh,	no
8909	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Liz and Andreas - actually they're not here, but,	no
8910	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	they did say at one point that they thought they could do a pretty good job of just doing a forced alignment.	no
8911	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And,	no
8912	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	again, I don't think we'll be able to do with that	no
8913	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	because, um, sometimes people correct themselves and things like that.	no
8914	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But - so, I was just wondering what people thought about	no
8915	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	how automated can we make the	no
8916	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	doing a forced alignment, and doing the timing.	no
8917	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, forced alignment would be one thing. What about just actually doing recognition?	no
8918	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, we - we	no
8919	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	No, they make mistakes.	no
8920	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
8921	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But,	no
8922	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the	no
8923	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	digits.	no
8924	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
8925	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	You're talking about as a	no
8926	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Um -	no
8927	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Is that what you're - ?	no
8928	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah, I'm - I'm not quite sure what I'm talking about. I mean -	no
8929	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I -	no
8930	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I mean,	no
8931	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh, we're talking about digits now. And - and so,	no
8932	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um,	no
8933	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	there's a bunch of stuff that hasn't been	no
8934	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	marked yet.	no
8935	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And,	no
8936	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um,	no
8937	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I mean, so one option i-	no
8938	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	there's the issue that -	no
8939	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	that they - we know what -	no
8940	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	what was said,	no
8941	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	but do we? Because people	no
8942	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	make mistakes and stuff.	no
8943	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I was just	no
8944	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh, the S_R_I recognizer getting one percent word error,	no
8945	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh,	no
8946	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	would we -	no
8947	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	would we do	no
8948	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So, if you do a forced alignment but the force- but the - but the transcription you have is wrong because they actually made mistakes, uh, or	no
8949	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But that's pretty uncommon.	no
8950	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	false starts,	no
8951	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	it's - it's much less c-	no
8952	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	it's	no
8953	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Um,	no
8954	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	if we could really get one percent on -	no
8955	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well,	no
8956	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	We should be able to. Right?	no
8957	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I guess - yeah, I guess if we	no
8958	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
8959	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	we could get one percent on digits.	no
8960	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
8961	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So that's just my question. I'm not saying it should be one way or the other, but it's - If -	no
8962	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But,	no
8963	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, there - there're a couple different of doing it. We could	no
8964	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	use the tools I've already developed and transcribe it. Hire some people,	no
8965	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	or use the transcribers to do it. We could let I_B_M transcribe it.	no
8966	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	You know, they're doing it anyway, and unless we tell them	no
8967	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Um, or we could try some automated methods.	no
8968	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And	no
8969	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well -	no
8970	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	comes back with this meeting and the transcript is	no
8971	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	just let	no
8972	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah, it's - Y- you raised a point, kind of,	no
8973	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh, euphemistically - but, I mean, m- maybe it is a serious problem. Ho- what will they do when they go - hear	no
8974	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	"""beep"	no
8975	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	you think they'll - we'll get - ?	no
8976	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	It's pretty distinct.	no
8977	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	The beeps are	no
8978	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah?	no
8979	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	It'll	no
8980	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
8981	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well it -	no
8982	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	"it - well, it'd be preceded by ""I'm reading transcript"	no
8983	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	"so-and-so""?"	no
8984	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
8985	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yes.	no
8986	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So,	no
8987	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I	no
8988	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	think if they're processing it at -	no
8989	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I mean, it'll be - it will be in the midst of a digit string.	no
8990	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So -	no
8991	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
8992	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I mean it - sure, there - there might be a place where it's	no
8993	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	"""beep seven"	no
8994	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	beep	no
8995	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	eight	no
8996	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But, you know, they - they're - they're gonna macros for inserting the beep marks.	no
8997	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And so, I - I don't think it'll be a problem. We'll have to see, but I don't think it's gonna be a problem.	no
8998	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K.	no
8999	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, I - I - I dunno, I - I think that that's - if they are in fact going to transcribe these things,	no
9000	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh,	no
9001	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	certainly any process that we'd have to	no
9002	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	correct them, or whatever is - needs to be much less elaborate for digits than	no
9003	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
9004	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	for other stuff. So, why not?	no
9005	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Sure.	no
9006	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	That was it?	no
9007	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	That was it.	no
9008	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Just,	no
9009	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	what do we do with digits? We have so many of them,	no
9010	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K.	no
9011	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, we - we -	no
9012	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and it'd be nice to	no
9013	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	we wanna have	no
9014	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	You mean there're more than ten?	no
9015	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah, I -	no
9016	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Your mike is a little low there.	no
9017	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I- in Berkeley, yeah.	no
9018	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So,	no
9019	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh	no
9020	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	You - you have to go a	no
9021	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, I can stay till about, uh,	no
9022	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	At twenty -	no
9023	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	three forty.	no
9024	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Alright. So le- let's make sure we do the ones that -	no
9025	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
9026	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	yes
9027	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	no
9028	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	that, uh,	no
9029	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	saved you. So there was some -	no
9030	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Uh	no
9031	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	In -	no
9032	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	in -	no
9033	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Adam's agenda list, he had something from you about segmentation this last recognition?	no
9034	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, yeah. So this is just	no
9035	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	partly to inform everybody,	no
9036	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Oops.	no
9037	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um,	no
9038	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and - and of course to get,	no
9039	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um,	no
9040	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	input.	no
9041	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Um,	no
9042	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	so,	no
9043	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh, we had a discussion -	no
9044	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Don and	no
9045	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Liz and I had discussion last week about	no
9046	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	how to proceed with, uh,	no
9047	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Ch-	no
9048	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	you know, with	no
9049	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and - and, uh, one of	no
9050	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the obvious	no
9051	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	things that	no
9052	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	occur to us was that	no
9053	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	we're - since we now have Thilo's	no
9054	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	segmenter and it works,	no
9055	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	you know, amazingly well,	no
9056	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um,	no
9057	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	we should actually	no
9058	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	basically re-evaluate the recognition,	no
9059	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um,	no
9060	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	results	no
9061	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	using - you know, without cheating on the segmentations.	no
9062	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And, that should be fairly -	no
9063	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So -	no
9064	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And how do we find the transcripts for	no
9065	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
9066	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Oh, O_K.	no
9067	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	The references for - for	no
9068	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So, there's actually -	no
9069	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	It's not that -	no
9070	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Why do you ask?	no
9071	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	No, actually, um,	no
9072	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I could -	no
9073	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well -	no
9074	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Hand ones.	no
9075	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	NIST	no
9076	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	has,	no
9077	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um	no
9078	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	m-	no
9079	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	a fairly sophisticated scoring program	no
9080	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K.	no
9081	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	that you can give a, um -	no
9082	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	a time,	no
9083	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh -	no
9084	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	You know, you basically just give two	no
9085	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and it	no
9086	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	computes	no
9087	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the	no
9088	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um -	no
9089	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the,	no
9090	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh -	no
9091	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	you know,	no
9092	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	It does all the work for you.	no
9093	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the - the - th- it does all the work for you.	no
9094	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
9095	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K.	no
9096	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So, it - we just - and we use that actually in Hub-five	no
9097	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	to do the scoring.	no
9098	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Um. So what we've been using so far was sort of a	no
9099	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And we can -	no
9100	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	we can handle the -	no
9101	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the - the	no
9102	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	type of problem we have here.	no
9103	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So, we ha-	no
9104	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So, basically you give some time constraints for - for the references and for - for the hypothesis, and - Yeah, O_K.	no
9105	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
9106	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
9107	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
9108	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah. Maybe the	no
9109	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So do-	no
9110	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K.	no
9111	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
9112	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	It does time-constrained word-alignment.	no
9113	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K.	no
9114	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So.	no
9115	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So that	no
9116	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	should be possible.	no
9117	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I mean that shouldn't be a	no
9118	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	problem.	no
9119	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Uh, so that was the one thing, and the other was that, um -	no
9120	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	What was the other problem? Oh!	no
9121	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	That	no
9122	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Thilo wanted to use	no
9123	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
9124	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Um,	no
9125	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	so that	no
9126	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	we could use,	no
9127	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh - you know there wouldn't be so much hand	no
9128	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	labeling needed	no
9129	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	to, uh -	no
9130	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	to generate training data for - for the speech detector.	no
9131	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah. I'm just in progress of - of doing that. So.	no
9132	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And I think you're in the	no
9133	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
9134	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	you can -	no
9135	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	It'll give you a lot more data, too. Won't it?	no
9136	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	you can -	no
9137	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
9138	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So, it's basically -	no
9139	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	s-	no
9140	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I think, eight meetings or something which - which I'm using, and,	no
9141	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	no
9142	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	it's -	no
9143	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	before it was twenty minutes of one meeting. So -	no
9144	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
9145	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	should	no
9146	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	That won't be perfect - the alignments aren't perfect,	no
9147	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Great.	no
9148	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah. But -	no
9149	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	but,	no
9150	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um,	no
9151	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
9152	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	it's probably still	no
9153	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
9154	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yep.	no
9155	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	than - Yeah.	no
9156	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	We'll see that.	no
9157	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
9158	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Actually, I had a question about that. If you find that you can	no
9159	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	lower the false alarms	no
9160	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	that you get	no
9161	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	where there's no speech, that would be	no
9162	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	useful	no
9163	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um -	no
9164	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	There were the false alarms.	no
9165	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah. So,	no
9166	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	r- right now you get f-	no
9167	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K.	no
9168	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	fal- you know, false - false, uh, speech regions when it's just like, um,	no
9169	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
9170	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	breath or something like that, and I'd be interested to know the -	no
9171	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yep.	no
9172	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	wha- if you retrain	no
9173	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um,	no
9174	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
9175	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	do those actually go down or not? Because	no
9176	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah. I'll - can make - an-	no
9177	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	can, like, make a c- comparison of - of the old system to the - to the new one, and	no
9178	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah, just to see if by doing nothing in the modeling of - just having that training data wh- what happens.	no
9179	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
9180	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yep.	no
9181	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Um	no
9182	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Adam's agenda	no
9183	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	definitely involved you was s- something about SmartKom?	yes
9184	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right. So,	no
9185	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Rob	no
9186	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and the, uh -	no
9187	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Porzel.	no
9188	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Porzel.	no
9189	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and the, uh,	no
9190	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	SmartKom group are collecting some dialogues. Basically they have one person sitting in here,	no
9191	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	looking at a picture, and a wizard sitting in another room somewhere.	no
9192	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And, uh, they're doing a travel task.	no
9193	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And, uh,	no
9194	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	it involves starting - I believe starting with a -	no
9195	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	It's - it's always the wizard, but it starts where the wizard is pretending to be a computer and it goes through a, uh,	no
9196	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	speech generation system.	no
9197	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah. Actually, it's changed to a synthesis for - for the first part now. Yeah.	no
9198	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Synthesis system.	no
9199	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Um, and then,	no
9200	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	it goes to a real wizard and they're	no
9201	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and so the w-	no
9202	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And	no
9203	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	who are using this corpus for	no
9204	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Um, or also for	no
9205	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Um, so it's not	no
9206	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	a	no
9207	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	two people and they're not face to face.	no
9208	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Wait a minute.	no
9209	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
9210	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I just wanted to understand it, cuz I -	no
9211	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I'm -	no
9212	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh, hadn't quite followed this	no
9213	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	process. Um.	no
9214	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So,	no
9215	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	it's wizard in the sen- usual sense that the person who is	no
9216	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	asking the questions doesn't know that it's, uh, a machi- not a machine?	no
9217	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
9218	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Actually - actually,	no
9219	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	At the beginning.	no
9220	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	w- w-	no
9221	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the - the - We do this - I dunno who came up with it, but I think it's a really clever idea.	no
9222	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	We simulate a computer breakdown	no
9223	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
9224	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	halfway through the session,	no
9225	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and so then after that,	no
9226	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the person's told that they're now talking to a,	no
9227	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh -	no
9228	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	It's a human operator.	no
9229	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	to a human.	no
9230	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
9231	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
9232	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But of course they don't know that it's the same person both times.	no
9233	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So, we - we collect - we collect both human-computer and human-human data,	no
9234	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	essentially, in the same	no
9235	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	session.	no
9236	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	collecting it the other way around sometime, saying that th- the computer isn't up yet and then - so then you can separate it out whether it's the beginning or end kind of effects. But, yeah.	no
9237	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Hmm.	no
9238	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	That's an idea.	no
9239	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yep.	no
9240	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
9241	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	"""I have to go now. You can talk to the computer."""	no
9242	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	"""No!"""	no
9243	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	It's a lot more believable, too, if you tell	no
9244	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the computer part is running on a Windows machine.	no
9245	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And the whole breakdown thing kinda makes sense.	no
9246	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O-	no
9247	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Just -	no
9248	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	just reboot it.	no
9249	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Abort -	no
9250	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	abort, retry, fail?	no

9260	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Or -	no

9263	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	No, the - the	no
9264	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
9265	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no

9267	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I - I see no reason not to do all of them.	no

9269	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Um -	no
9270	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	that if we	no
9271	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Hmm.	no
9272	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
9273	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh, it's nice to have	no
9274	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the	no
9275	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So, what is the purpose of this recording?	no
9276	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	no
9277	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	This is to	no
9278	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	It's to be traini- to b- training data and development data for the SmartKom	no
9279	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	The English system?	no
9280	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	get	no
9281	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
9282	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
9283	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	training data for SmartKom.	no
9284	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
9285	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
9286	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K.	no
9287	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Where does this - ?	no
9288	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Maybe we can have him vary the microphones, too, or they're different s- speakers.	no
9289	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well,	no
9290	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	B-	no
9291	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right. So - so - so for	no
9292	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	so why not - ?	no
9293	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah. But - but I'm not sure about the legal aspect of - of that. Is - is there some contract with SmartKom or something about the data? What	no
9294	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right?	no
9295	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
9296	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	they - or, is - is that	no
9297	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	We've never signed anything that said that	no
9298	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K.	no
9299	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	we couldn't use anything that we did.	no
9300	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K.	no
9301	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	We weren't supposed to collect any data.	no
9302	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So.	no
9303	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K.	no
9304	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	This was all -	no
9305	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
9306	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So. Yeah, th- th- that was the question. If - if - ? Yeah.	no
9307	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
9308	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Basically.	no
9309	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	No	no
9310	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	no
9311	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and we have these distant mikes, we definitely should re-	no
9312	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	should	no
9313	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	save it all as long as we've got disk space, and disk is pretty cheap. So should we	no
9314	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K.	no
9315	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And then -	no
9316	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Now th- Yeah.	no
9317	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So we save it because it's - it - it's potentially useful.	no
9318	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
9319	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And now,	no
9320	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	what do we do with it is - is a s- separate question.	no
9321	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I mean, anybody who's training something up could	no
9322	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	choose	no
9323	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	to put it -	no
9324	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
9325	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	eh, to u- include this or not. I - I would not say it was part of the meetings corpus. It isn't.	no
9326	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But it's some other data we have, and if somebody	no
9327	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	doing experiment wants to train up including that then they can. Right?	no
9328	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	no
9329	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So it's -	no
9330	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	It -	no
9331	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	it -	no
9332	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I guess it - the -	no
9333	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	begs the question of what is the meeting corpus. So if,	no
9334	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	at U_W they start recording	no
9335	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	two-person	no
9336	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I think it's - I -	no
9337	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	hallway conversations is that	no
9338	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	part of the meeting corpus?	no
9339	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I think - I th- think the idea of two or more people conversing with one another is key.	no
9340	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, this has two or more people conversing with each other. They're just not face to face.	no
9341	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Nnn, well	no
9342	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
9343	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	What if we just give it a -	no
9344	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	No, it doesn't. Right? It has -	no
9345	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	a name like we give these meetings a name?	no
9346	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I mean, that was my intention.	no
9347	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And then later on some people will consider it a meeting and some people won't, and -	no
9348	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
9349	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	That was my intention. So - so - s-	no
9350	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well this -	no
9351	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Just give it a	no
9352	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	so	no
9353	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	title.	no
9354	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	do we wanna	no
9355	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Oh.	no
9356	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I think it is a s-	no
9357	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	we- give everyone who's involved as	no
9358	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	their own user I_D, give it session I_Ds,	no
9359	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	let all the tools that handle Meeting Recorder handle it,	no
9360	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	or do we wanna special case it? And if we were gonna special case it,	no
9361	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well,	no
9362	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So. It - it - it -	no
9363	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	it -	no
9364	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	who's gonna do that?	no
9365	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	it makes sense to handle it	no
9366	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I think -	no
9367	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	with the same infrastructure, since we don't want to duplicate things unnecessarily. But as far as	no
9368	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	distributing it, we shouldn't label it as part of this	no
9369	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	meeting corpus. We should	no
9370	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
9371	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	let it be its own corp-	no
9372	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I don't see why not. It's just a different topic.	no
9373	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well it's - it - well, because -	no
9374	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I ha- I have an extra point, which is the naturalness issue.	no
9375	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Because we have, like, meetings that have a reason. That's one of the reasons that we were	no
9376	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	talking about this. And - and those -	no
9377	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
9378	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and this sounds like it's more of an experimental setup. It's got a different purpose.	no
9379	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	It's scenario-based, it's - it's human-computer interface -	no
9380	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	it's really	no
9381	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	pretty different. But I- I - I have no problem with somebody folding it in	no
9382	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
9383	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	for some experiment they're gonna do, but I don't think	no
9384	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	i- it - it doesn't match anything that we've described about meetings.	no
9385	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	no
9386	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Whereas everything that we talked about them doing at - at U_W and so forth really	no
9387	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K. So w- so what does that	no
9388	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Hmm.	no
9389	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
9390	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	if you wanna use the same	no
9391	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	It is	no
9392	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	You can't just fold it in as if it's - I mean,	no
9393	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	It might also be potentially confusing.	no
9394	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah, but those are folded in, and it's just -	no
9395	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	you just mark the transcripts differently. So - so one option is you fold it in,	no
9396	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
9397	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and just simply in the file you mark somewhere that this is this type of	no
9398	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah, I th-	no
9399	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, I don- I wouldn't call	no
9400	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	"reading digits ""meetings""."	no
9401	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right? I mean, we - we - we were doing -	no
9402	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, but -	no
9403	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	but,	no
9404	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	"I put it under the same directory tree. You know, it's in ""user doctor speech data M_R""."	no
9405	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well -	no
9406	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	"Can we just have a directory called, like, ""other stuff""?"	no
9407	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And -	no
9408	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Other.	no
9409	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well - or, I dunno.	no
9410	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I mean, I don't care what directory tree you have it under.	no
9411	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And -	no
9412	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and just,	no
9413	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um, store it there. I mean -	no
9414	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K. My preference	no
9415	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	is to have a single procedure so that I don't have to	no
9416	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And,	no
9417	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
9418	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	just have a marking.	no
9419	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	If we do it any	no
9420	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_-	no
9421	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	You - you can use whatever procedure you want	no
9422	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and someone has to	no
9423	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	that's p- convenient for you. All I'm saying is that there's no way that we're gonna tell people that reading digits is meetings.	no
9424	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
9425	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And similarly we're not gonna tell them that someone talking to a computer to get travel information is meetings.	no
9426	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Those aren't meetings.	no
9427	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But if it makes it easier for you to pu- fold them in the same procedures and have them under the same directory tree, knock yourself out. You know?	no
9428	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	There's a	no
9429	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	couple other questions that I have too, and -	no
9430	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and	no
9431	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	consent issues?	no
9432	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And the other one is, what about transcription?	no
9433	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Transcription is done in Munich.	no
9434	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Are - ?	no
9435	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K. So	no
9436	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
9437	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Alright.	no
9438	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So, w- we will hafta worry about	no
9439	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	That's a - that's another argument to keep it separate, because it's gonna follow the SmartKom transcription conventions and not the	no
9440	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	format.	no
9441	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Oh, O_K.	no
9442	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
9443	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	ICSI meeting transcription	no
9444	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K. Well, I didn't realize that. That's - that's a -	no
9445	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Good point.	no
9446	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Good point.	no
9447	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But I'm sure no one would have a problem with our folding it in for some acoustic modeling or - or some things.	no
9448	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Um.	no
9449	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Do we h- do we have, uh,	no
9450	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um,	no
9451	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	American-born folk, uh, reading German -	no
9452	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	German, uh, pla- uh,	no
9453	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	place names and so forth? Is that - ?	no
9454	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
9455	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Exactly.	no
9456	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yep.	no
9457	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah, great.	no
9458	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
9459	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	They - they even have a reading list. It's pretty funny.	no
9460	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I bet that sounds good, huh?	no
9461	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
9462	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
9463	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	You can do that if you want.	no
9464	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
9465	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
9466	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
9467	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So -	no
9468	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Hmm.	no
9469	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Heidelberg	no
9470	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Disk might eventually be an issue so we might -	yes
9471	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Disk might eventually be an issue so we might -	no
9472	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Do you wanna be a subject?	no
9473	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah, I be pretty good.	no
9474	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	we -	no
9475	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	we might need to, uh,	no
9476	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	get some more disk pretty soon. We're about -	no
9477	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	We -	no
9478	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
9479	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	That was one of our concerns.	no
9480	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
9481	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	we're about half -	no
9482	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	halfway through our disk right now.	no
9483	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Are we only half? I thought we were more than that.	no
9484	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	We're probably a little more than that because we're using up some space that we shouldn't be on.	no
9485	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So,	no
9486	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	once everything gets converted over to the disks we're	no
9487	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh, seventy-five percent.	no
9488	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, when I was looking for space for Thilo, I found one disk that had,	no
9489	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh,	no
9490	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I think it was nine gigs and another one had seventeen.	no
9491	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yep.	no
9492	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And everything else was sorta committed.	no
9493	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Uh -	no
9494	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Were those	no
9495	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	backed-up or non-backed-up?	no
9496	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Those were	no
9497	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right. So that's different.	no
9498	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	S- oh, you're talking about backed-up.	no
9499	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I'm much more concerned about	no
9500	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the backed-up.	no
9501	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	The non-backed-up,	no
9502	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I haven't looked to see how much of that we have.	no
9503	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	is cheap. I mean, if we need to we can	no
9504	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	buy a disk, hang it off a s- uh, workstation. If it's not backed-up the sysadmins don't care too much.	no
9505	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah. So, I mean,	no
9506	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	pretty much anytime we need a disk, we can get it at the rate that we're -	no
9507	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	You can -	no
9508	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I shouldn't be saying this, but,	no
9509	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	you can just -	no
9510	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	you know,	no
9511	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	since	no
9512	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the back-ups are every night,	no
9513	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	you can recycle the backed-up diskspace.	no
9514	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah. But that's - that's -	no
9515	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah. You really shouldn't be saying -	no
9516	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mmm. Mmm.	no
9517	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I didn't say that. I didn't say that.	no
9518	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah, that's right. Beep that out.	no
9519	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Da- we had allowed Dave to listen to these -	no
9520	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
9521	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh, recordings.	no
9522	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah, I me- and	no
9523	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	there's been this	no
9524	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	conversation going on about getting another file server, and -	no
9525	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	no
9526	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and	no
9527	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	we	no
9528	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	We'll	no
9529	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	take the opportunity and get another big raft of -	no
9530	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
9531	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	of disk, I guess.	no
9532	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well,	no
9533	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	It's really the back-up issue rather than the file server issue.	no
9534	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I think -	no
9535	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I think there's an argument for having - you know, you could use our old file server for - for disks that have data that	no
9536	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	rarely accessed, and then have a fast	no
9537	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	new file server	no
9538	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	for	no
9539	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	data that is, um,	no
9540	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
9541	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	heavily	no
9542	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	accessed.	no
9543	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	My understanding is, the issue isn't really the file server. We could	no
9544	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
9545	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
9546	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	It's the back- it's the back-up capaci- Yeah.	no
9547	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So - which is near saturation,	no
9548	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	apparently.	no
9549	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So.	no
9550	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Soon.	no
9551	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I think - I think the file server	no
9552	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	we get	no
9553	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	a whole bunch more	no
9554	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	new compute machines. And we've got,	no
9555	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	you know,	no
9556	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	fifty	no
9557	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	machines trying to access	no
9558	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	data off of Abbott at once.	no
9559	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, we're alright for now because the network's so slow.	no
9560	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I mean, I think - I think we've raised this before and someone said this is not a reliable	no
9561	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	way to do it, but the -	no
9562	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	What about putting the stuff on,	no
9563	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	like, C_- C_D-ROM or D_V_D or something?	no
9564	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah. That was me.	no
9565	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I was the one who said it was not reliable. The- they -	no
9566	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K.	no
9567	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	they wear out.	no
9568	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Oh, O_K.	no
9569	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah. The - the - th-	no
9570	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But they wear out just from sitting on the shelf?	no
9571	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yep.	no
9572	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Absolutely.	no
9573	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Or from being	no
9574	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	No.	no
9575	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Read and write don't hurt	no
9576	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Oh, O_K.	no
9577	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But the r-	no
9578	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the write once, and the read-writes, don't last.	no
9579	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So you don't wa- you don't wanna put ir-	no
9580	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	reproduceable data	no
9581	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Wear out after what amount of time?	no
9582	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Year or two.	no
9583	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Would it be - ?	no
9584	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yep.	no
9585	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Wow.	no
9586	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Hmm.	no
9587	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But if that -	no
9588	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	then you would	no
9589	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	think you'd	no
9590	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	clamoring about	no
9591	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
9592	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	data loss and -	no
9593	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I mean, yeah, all the L_-	no
9594	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I - I don't know many people who do it on C_D.	no
9595	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I mean, they're - the most -	no
9596	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	L_D_C- all the L_D_C distributions are on C_D-ROM.	no
9597	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	fo-	no
9598	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
9599	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	They're on C_D, but they're not -	no
9600	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Like -	no
9601	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	tha- that's not the only source. They have	no
9602	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And they burn new ones every once in a while. But if you go -	no
9603	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But, you know, we have -	no
9604	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But we have like thirty	no
9605	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	if you go k-	no
9606	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	We have all sorts of C_D-ROMs from a long time ago.	no
9607	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah! Ten years ago. Ninety-one, and they're still all fine.	no
9608	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
9609	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
9610	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, th-	no
9611	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	th-	no
9612	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Were they burned or were they pressed?	no
9613	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
9614	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Uh, both. I've burned them and they're still O_K. I mean,	no
9615	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
9616	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K. The - the	no
9617	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Oh, I see.	no
9618	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But, uh,	no
9619	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the	no
9620	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	when I say two or three years what I'm saying is that	no
9621	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	That's what I -	no
9622	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I have had disks which are	no
9623	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	On the	no
9624	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But, uh - I - I - you don't want to per-	no
9625	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	p- have your only copy on a media that	no
9626	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	fails.	no
9627	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mmm.	no
9628	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And they do.	no
9629	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So how	no
9630	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Um,	no
9631	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	if you have	no
9632	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	y- you know, they're good for decades.	no
9633	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So -	no
9634	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	so how about putting them on that	no
9635	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	plus,	no
9636	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	like on a - on -	no
9637	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	on DAT or some other	no
9638	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	medium that isn't	no
9639	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I think th- um,	no
9640	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	we can already put them on tape.	no
9641	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K.	no
9642	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And the tape is hi- is	no
9643	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	no
9644	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So the - the only issue is then	no
9645	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
9646	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So that's fine f- if we don't need access to	no
9647	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, if - if - if you - if they last -	no
9648	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Say, they actually last, like, five years, huh,	no
9649	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	in - in the typical case,	no
9650	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and -	no
9651	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and occasionally you might need to recreate one,	no
9652	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and then you get your tape out, but otherwise you don't.	no
9653	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Can't you just - you just put them on - ?	no
9654	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So you just archive it on the	no
9655	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	tape, and then	no
9656	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
9657	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	put it on C_D as well?	no
9658	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
9659	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Oh. So you're just saying put	no
9660	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	for normal access.	no
9661	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
9662	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
9663	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
9664	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I mean, you can do that but that's pretty annoying, because the C_Ds are so slow.	no
9665	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	What you -	no
9666	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	See -	no
9667	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
9668	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mmm.	no
9669	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	What'd be nice is a system that re-burned the C_Ds every	no
9670	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	year.	no
9671	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	"H- everytime it was a ""gonna"" - ""gonna die""."	no
9672	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, I mean, the C_Ds are -	no
9673	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well -	no
9674	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	It's like - like dynamic ra- D_RAM.	no
9675	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	are	no
9676	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	an op-	no
9677	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Just before.	no
9678	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Just before they- be- before it goes bad, it burns them in.	no
9679	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
9680	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	The -	no
9681	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the C_D is an	no
9682	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
9683	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	You know -	no
9684	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So for archiving, we'll just use tape.	no
9685	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	One - one thing I don't understand is, if you have the data -	no
9686	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	if - if you- if the meeting data	no
9687	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	is put on disk exactly once,	no
9688	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	then it's backed-up once and the back-up system should never have to	no
9689	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well,	no
9690	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	bother with it,	no
9691	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	regardless - Well, first of all there was,	no
9692	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um, a problem with the	no
9693	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	archive in that I was every once in a while doing a chmod on all the directories an- or recursive chmod and chown, because	no
9694	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	no
9695	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	they weren't getting	no
9696	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	doing a	no
9697	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	minus R_ star,	no
9698	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	no
9699	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	not realizing that that	no
9700	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Ah.	no
9701	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	caused	no
9702	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But	no
9703	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But even without that, the back-up system is becoming saturated.	no
9704	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But - but this back-up system is smart enough to figure out that something hasn't changed and doesn't need to be	no
9705	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Sure, but we still have enough changed	no
9706	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	The b-	no
9707	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	that the nightly back-ups are starting to take too long.	no
9708	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I think th- the - at least the once tha- that you put it on, it would -	no
9709	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	it would	no
9710	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K. So - so then, if - So - so then, let's - Right.	no
9711	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	It has nothing to do with the meeting. It's just the general ICSI back-up system is becoming saturated.	no
9712	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	kill that. So.	no
9713	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K.	no
9714	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
9715	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So, what if we buy,	no
9716	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh -	no
9717	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh, what - what do they call these, um	no
9718	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, why don't you have this -	no
9719	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	have a -	no
9720	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	this conversation with Dave Johnson tha- rather than with me?	no
9721	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	No, no. Because this is	no
9722	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and,	no
9723	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	putting more burden on him.	no
9724	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	How	no
9725	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh - uh - uh, one of these high density tape drives?	no
9726	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And we put the data actually on non-backed-up	no
9727	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	disks.	no
9728	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And we do our own back-up once and for	no
9729	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Actually, you know, we could do that just with the tape - with the current tape.	no
9730	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I dunno what the- these tapes - uh, at some point these -	no
9731	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I dunno. What kind of tape drive is it? Is it - is - ?	no
9732	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I dunno but it's an automatic robot so it's very convenient.	no
9733	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Wh-	no
9734	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
9735	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	You just run a program to restore them.	no
9736	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	The o-	no
9737	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the one that we have?	no
9738	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
9739	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But it might interfere with their back-up schedule, eh.	no
9740	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	The - I mean -	no
9741	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But -	no
9742	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	No, we have s- we - Don't we have our own? Something wi- th- that doesn't -	no
9743	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	that isn't used by the back-up gang?	no
9744	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Don't we have something	no
9745	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well they -	no
9746	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	downstairs?	no
9747	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Just in - ?	no
9748	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well -	no
9749	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
9750	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	but - no, but Andreas's point is a good one. And we don't	no
9751	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
9752	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right. So your - your	no
9753	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mmm.	no
9754	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	On an X_H - uh, X_ - X_ whatever partition.	no
9755	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
9756	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	That's not a bad idea.	no
9757	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah, that's basically what I was gonna say, is that a disk is - is so cheap it's es- essentially, you know, close to free.	no
9758	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So once it's on tape -	no
9759	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
9760	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And the only thing that costs is the back-up	no
9761	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
9762	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	eh, to first order. And we can take care of that by putting it on non-back-	no
9763	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	no
9764	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	backing it up once onto this tape.	no
9765	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I think that's a good idea.	no
9766	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
9767	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K.	no
9768	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Good.	no
9769	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	It's good.	no
9770	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So,	no
9771	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	who's gonna do these back-ups? The people that collect it?	no
9772	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Uh	no
9773	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, I'll talk to Dave,	no
9774	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and - and see what th- how -	no
9775	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	what the best way of doing that is.	no
9776	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	It's probably gonna n-	no
9777	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	There's a little utility	no
9778	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	that	no
9779	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	will manually burn a tape for you, and that's probably the right way to do it.	no
9780	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah, and we should probably make that part of the procedure for recording the meetings.	no
9781	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, s-	no
9782	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yep.	no
9783	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah. That's what I'm wondering, if -	no
9784	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well	no
9785	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K.	no
9786	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I mean, you don't have to physically	no
9787	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	put a tape in the drive? Or s- ?	no
9788	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	No.	no
9789	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Oh, O_K.	no
9790	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	It's all tape robot, so you just sit down at your computer and you type a command.	no
9791	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So it's just -	no
9792	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Oh, O_K.	no
9793	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah, but then you're effectively using the resources of the back-up system.	no
9794	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Or is that a different tape robot?	no
9795	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But not at the same time.	no
9796	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah. But y- but you would be anyway.	no
9797	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	No, no. See -	no
9798	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right? Because -	no
9799	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	No, no, no.	no
9800	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah, just give a dedi-	no
9801	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But there's no reason to do that.	no
9802	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, I'm saying is	no
9803	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	It - we already have it there and it - it's -	no
9804	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	i- if you go to Dave, and - and -	no
9805	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	"and ask him ""can I use your tape robot?"","	no
9806	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	he will say,	no
9807	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	"""well"	no
9808	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	No, we won't.	no
9809	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	He'll say	no
9810	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	"""if - if that means"	no
9811	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	He- I -	no
9812	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Dave has - has promoted this in the past. So I don't think he's actually against it. Yeah.	no
9813	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah. It's - it's definitely no problem.	no
9814	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Oh, O_K. Alright.	no
9815	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Alright.	no
9816	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Good.	no
9817	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	What about if the times overlap	no
9818	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	with the normal back-up	no
9819	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	time?	no
9820	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Um, it's - it's just - it's just a utility which queues up.	no
9821	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K.	no
9822	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	It just queues it up and - and when it's available, it will copy it.	no
9823	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
9824	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And then	no
9825	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	you can tell it to then remove it from the disk or you can, you know, do it a-	no
9826	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	a few days later or whatever you wanna do,	no
9827	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	after you confirm that it's really backed-up.	no
9828	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K.	no
9829	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	N_W - ?	no
9830	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	You saying N_W archive?	no
9831	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	N_W archive. That's what it is.	no
9832	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yep	no
9833	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And if you did that during the day it would never make it to the nightly back-ups.	no
9834	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
9835	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And then there wouldn't be this extra load.	no
9836	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, it - if he - you have to put the data on a - on a non-backed-up disk to begin with.	no
9837	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So that - so that -	no
9838	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
9839	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well,	no
9840	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	but you can have it N_W archive to - you can have,	no
9841	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	otherwise you don't - you -	no
9842	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh, a non-backed-up disk N_W archived,	no
9843	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
9844	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and it'll never show up on the nightly back-ups.	no
9845	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And then it never -	no
9846	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
9847	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
9848	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
9849	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Which I'm sure would make ever- the sysadmins very happy.	no
9850	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
9851	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
9852	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So, I think that's a good idea.	no
9853	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	That's what we should do.	no
9854	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So, that means we'll probably wanna convert all -	no
9855	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	all those files -	no
9856	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	filesystems to non-backed-up media.	no
9857	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	That sounds good.	no
9858	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yep.	yes
9859	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yep.	no
9860	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
9861	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Um,	no
9862	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	thing on the agenda said	no
9863	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	S_R_I recognition experiments?	no
9864	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	S_R_I recognition?	no
9865	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	That wasn't me.	no
9866	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Um.	no
9867	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	well,	no
9868	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	we have lots of them.	no
9869	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Uh,	no
9870	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I dunno. Chuck, do you have any -	no
9871	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	any updates?	no
9872	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	N- I'm	no
9873	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	successfully, uh, increasing the error rate.	no
9874	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Uh -	no
9875	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	That's good.	no
9876	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Oh.	no
9877	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mmm.	no
9878	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Lift the Herve approach.	no
9879	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
9880	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So, I mean I'm just playing with, um,	no
9881	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the number of Gaussians that we use in the - the recognizer, and -	no
9882	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, you have to sa- you have to	no
9883	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yes, I'm using tandem features.	no
9884	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Oh you are? Cool.	no
9885	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	A- and I'm still	no
9886	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And -	no
9887	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	tinkering with the P_L_P features.	no
9888	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah, I got confused by the results. It sai- because - uh, the	no
9889	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	"you said ""O_K, we got it down to where they're - they're within a tenth of a percent""."	no
9890	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	That was on	no
9891	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
9892	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	That was - that was before I tried it on the females.	no
9893	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	See, women are nothi- are,	no
9894	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	It's the	no
9895	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	trouble. Right? As we all know. So.	no
9896	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, let's just say that men are simple.	no
9897	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So -	no
9898	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	so, when -	no
9899	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So I - I had -	no
9900	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	That was a quick response.	no
9901	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I ha-	no
9902	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So, we had reached the point where -	no
9903	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I'm well rehearsed.	no
9904	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
9905	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	we had reached the point where,	no
9906	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um,	no
9907	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	on the male portion of the	no
9908	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the,	no
9909	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um -	no
9910	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	or one of the development sets, I should say -	no
9911	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the, um -	no
9912	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the male error rate with, uh, ICSI P_L_P features	no
9913	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	was	no
9914	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	pretty much identical	no
9915	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	with, uh, S_R_I	no
9916	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	features.	no
9917	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	which are	no
9918	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um,	no
9919	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	"then I thought, ""Oh, great."	no
9920	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I'll j- I'll -	no
9921	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	"just let's make sure everything works on the females."" And"	no
9922	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the error rate -	no
9923	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Oh.	no
9924	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	you know, there was a three percent difference.	no
9925	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Uh-huh.	no
9926	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So,	no
9927	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Is there less training data?	no
9928	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh -	no
9929	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	No, actually there's more training data.	no
9930	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I mean, we don-	no
9931	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	This is on just digits?	no
9932	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	No, no.	no
9933	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Oh, sorry. O_K. This is on - Oh, O_K.	no
9934	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	No.	no
9935	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	No. It's, uh, Swi-	no
9936	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Hub-five.	no
9937	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	This is Hub-five.	no
9938	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Hub-five. Yeah.	no
9939	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
9940	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Um, and the test data is CallHome and Switchboard.	no
9941	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So,	no
9942	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh - so then	no
9943	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Oh, and plus the -	no
9944	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the vocal tract	no
9945	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	didn't -	no
9946	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	actually made things	no
9947	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So something's really seriously wrong. So -	no
9948	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Um -	no
9949	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Aha!	no
9950	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Hhh.	no
9951	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So -	no
9952	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K.	no
9953	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So -	no
9954	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So - but you see, now, between - between the males	no
9955	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and the females, there's certainly a much bigger	no
9956	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	difference in the scaling	no
9957	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	range,	no
9958	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	than there is, say, just within the males.	no
9959	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And what you were using before was scaling factors that were just from the - the m- the	no
9960	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And that worked - that worked fine.	no
9961	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	That's true.	no
9962	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
9963	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Uh,	no
9964	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	but now you're looking over a larger range and it may not be so fine.	no
9965	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, um -	no
9966	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So -	no
9967	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I just -	no
9968	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	d- so the one thing that I then tried was to	no
9969	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	put in the low-pass filter,	no
9970	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	which we have in the -	no
9971	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So, most -	no
9972	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	most	no
9973	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Hub-five systems actually	no
9974	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	band-limit the -	no
9975	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh, at about,	no
9976	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh, thirty-seven hundred,	no
9977	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Uh-huh.	no
9978	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um,	no
9979	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	hertz.	no
9980	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Although, you know, normally, I mean, the channel goes to	no
9981	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	four -	no
9982	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	four thousand. Right? So,	no
9983	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um -	no
9984	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And that actually helped,	no
9985	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh -	no
9986	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Uh-huh.	no
9987	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh,	no
9988	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	a little bit.	no
9989	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Um	no
9990	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um -	no
9991	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And I'm now,	no
9992	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh,	no
9993	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	trying	no
9994	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the -	no
9995	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Oh, and suddenly, also the v- the vocal tract length normalization only in the	no
9996	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So, you can do vocal tract length normalization	no
9997	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
9998	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	on the test data only or on both the training and the test.	no
9999	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And	no
10000	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	you expect it to help a	no
10001	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10002	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And	no
10003	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	so the -	no
10004	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	It now helps,	no
10005	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	if you do it only on the test, and	no
10006	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I'm currently retraining	no
10007	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	we'll -	no
10008	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	we'll have,	no
10009	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	hopefully, even better results. So -	no
10010	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But there's -	no
10011	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	It looks like there will still be some difference,	no
10012	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	maybe	no
10013	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	between one and two percent,	no
10014	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um,	no
10015	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Huh.	no
10016	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	for the females. And so,	no
10017	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um,	no
10018	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	you know, I'm open to suggestions.	no
10019	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And it	no
10020	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	no
10021	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	you know, we	no
10022	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But -	no
10023	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	it	no
10024	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	V_T_L,	no
10025	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Uh-huh.	no
10026	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	because	no
10027	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	if you	no
10028	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	No - no. I - I	no
10029	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	It's much worse.	no
10030	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh, you know, the -	no
10031	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10032	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the females are considerably worse	no
10033	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	in the -	no
10034	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	with the P_L_P features.	no
10035	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So there must be some -	no
10036	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	something else going on.	no
10037	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, what's the standard - ?	no
10038	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	That's what I thought, too.	no
10039	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Um,	no
10040	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	they're actually a little worse.	no
10041	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But that's beside the point. We're looking at the discrepancy between	no
10042	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the S_R_I	no
10043	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	system and the	no
10044	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	S_R_I system when trained with ICSI features.	no
10045	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right. I'm just wondering if that -	no
10046	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	What's - Are the freq- ?	no
10047	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	if - if you have any indication of your standard features, you know, if that's also different	no
10048	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	You're -	no
10049	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	This is - lemme ask a q-	no
10050	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Cuz -	no
10051	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	more basic que- I mean, is this, uh - uh,	no
10052	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	no
10053	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	iterative,	no
10054	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Baum-Welch training? Or is it Viterbi training? Or - ?	no
10055	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	It's Baum-Welch training.	no
10056	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Baum-Welch training.	no
10057	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And how do you determine when to - to stop iterating?	no
10058	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Um -	no
10059	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, actually,	no
10060	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	we - we just basically do a s-	no
10061	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	a fixed number of iterations.	no
10062	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Hmm.	no
10063	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Uh, in this case four.	no
10064	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Um,	no
10065	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	which -	no
10066	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Eh, we used to do only three, and then we	no
10067	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	found out we can squeeze -	no
10068	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And it was	no
10069	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	basically,	no
10070	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	we're s- we're keeping it on the safe side. But you're d- Right. It might be that one more iteration	no
10071	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	would - would help, but it's sort of	no
10072	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Or maybe - or maybe you're doing one too	no
10073	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	No, but with Baum-Welch,	no
10074	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	there shouldn't be an over-fitting issue, really.	no
10075	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Uh.	no
10076	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Um.	no
10077	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, you can try each one on a cross-validation set, can't you?	no
10078	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	It d- if you - if you remember some years ago Bill Byrne did a thing where he was - he was looking at that, and he showed that you	no
10079	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10080	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But -	no
10081	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, yeah. We can -	no
10082	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	but -	no
10083	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	but, um -	no
10084	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, that's - that's the easy one to check, because	no
10085	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10086	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Do you - ?	no
10087	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	we save all the intermediate models and we can -	no
10088	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And in each case, ho-	no
10089	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	What - ?	no
10090	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um, I'm sorry - in each case how do you determine,	no
10091	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	you know, the - the usual	no
10092	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the, uh, language, uh, scaling, acoustic scaling, uh,	no
10093	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Um	no
10094	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh -	no
10095	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I'm actually re-optimizing them.	no
10096	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Although that hasn't shown to make	no
10097	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K. And the pru- the question he was asking at one point about pruning,	no
10098	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh -	no
10099	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Pruning - ?	no
10100	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Remember that one?	no
10101	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Pruning in the - ?	no
10102	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, he was - he's - it looked like the probabil- at one point he was looking at the probabilities he was getting out - at the likelihoods he was getting out of P_L_P versus mel cepstrum, and they looked pretty different,	no
10103	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah, the likelihoods were	no
10104	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	as I recall.	no
10105	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Oh.	no
10106	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And so, uh, there's the question -	no
10107	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	for the P_L_P.	no
10108	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I- you mean -	no
10109	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	did you see this in the S_R_I system?	no
10110	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	no
10111	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Um.	no
10112	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Was just looking through the log files, and -	no
10113	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, the likelihoods are -	no
10114	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	You can't directly compare them,	no
10115	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	because, for every set of models you compute a new normalization.	no
10116	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And so these	no
10117	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	log probabilities, they aren't	no
10118	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	directly	no
10119	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Hmm.	no
10120	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But, still it's a question - if you have some threshold somewhere in terms of beam search or something, or - ?	no
10121	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	W- yeah. I mean -	no
10122	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Uh -	no
10123	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I mean, if you have one threshold that works well	no
10124	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	because	no
10125	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the range of your likelihoods is in	no
10126	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	this area -	no
10127	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	We prune very conservatively. I mean,	no
10128	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	as we saw with the meeting data,	no
10129	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um	no
10130	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	tighten the pruning without really -	no
10131	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So we- we basically we have a very open beam.	no
10132	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But, you're only talking about a percent or two. Right? Here we're- we're saying that we- there - gee, there's this b- eh, there's this difference here.	no
10133	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10134	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And	no
10135	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	See cuz, i- i-	no
10136	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	there could be lots of things. Right? But - but - but - but,	no
10137	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
10138	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Course.	no
10139	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um,	no
10140	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	let's suppose just for a second that, uh, we've sort of	no
10141	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	taken out a lot of the - the major differences, uh, between the two. I mean, we're already sort of using the mel scale and we're using the same style filter integration, and	no
10142	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	no
10143	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
10144	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and, well, we're making sure that low and high -	no
10145	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Actually, there is - the difference in that. So, for the P_L_P features we use the triangular	no
10146	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	filter shapes. And for the -	no
10147	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	in the S_R_I front-end we use the trapezoidal one.	no
10148	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And what's the top frequency of each?	no
10149	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, now it's the same.	no
10150	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	It's thirty -	no
10151	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	thirty to seven hundred and sixty hertz.	no
10152	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah. Exp- one's triangular, one's trapezoidal. So -	no
10153	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	No, no. But -	no
10154	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Before we - i- i- th- with straight P_L_P, it's trapezoidal also. But then we had a slight difference in the - in the scale.	no
10155	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well -	no
10156	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But -	no
10157	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Uh, so.	no
10158	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Since	no
10159	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	currently the Feacalc program doesn't allow me to change	no
10160	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Uh-huh.	no
10161	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And,	no
10162	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I did the experiment on the	no
10163	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	y- where the standard used to be	no
10164	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	to use trapezoidal filters.	no
10165	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	You can actually continuously vary it between the two. And so I	no
10166	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	wen-	no
10167	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I swi- I tried the trap- eh, triangular ones.	no
10168	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And it did	no
10169	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Hmm.	no
10170	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So -	no
10171	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Coup-	no
10172	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Couple tenths of a percent or something.	no
10173	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K. So it's	no
10174	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah, exactly. So, it's not - I don't think the filter shape by itself will make	no
10175	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	losing some	no
10176	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	frequency range.	no
10177	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10178	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	a huge	no
10179	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right. So the oth-	no
10180	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	difference.	no
10181	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10182	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the other	no
10183	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	thing that - So, f-	no
10184	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	i-	no
10185	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	We've always viewed it, anyway, as the	no
10186	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	is actually in the smoothing,	no
10187	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	no
10188	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	that the - that the, um,	no
10189	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	P_L_P, and -	no
10190	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and the reason P_L_P has been	no
10191	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	advantageous in, uh, slightly noisy situations is because,	no
10192	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	no
10193	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	P_L_P does the smoothing at the end by an auto-regressive model,	no
10194	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and mel cepstrum does it by just computing the lower	no
10195	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	cepstral coefficients.	no
10196	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	no
10197	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Um.	no
10198	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So,	no
10199	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um -	no
10200	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K. So	no
10201	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	a much larger -	no
10202	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	with our full training set.	no
10203	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So right now, we're using a -	no
10204	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I don't know, forty?	no
10205	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I- i- it's - it's -	no
10206	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	it's a f- training set that's about,	no
10207	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um,	no
10208	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	you know, by a factor of four smaller than what we use when we train the full system. So,	no
10209	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	no
10210	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	some of these smoothing issues are over-fitting for that matter. And the Baum-Welch	no
10211	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	no
10212	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	should	no
10213	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	be much less of a factor, if you go	no
10214	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	full -	no
10215	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Could be. Yeah.	no
10216	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	whole hog. And so,	no
10217	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	w- so, just um -	no
10218	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	so the strategy is to first sort of treat things	no
10219	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	when you've sort of,	no
10220	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	narrowed it down, you try it on a	no
10221	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10222	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	larger training set. And so, we haven't done that yet.	no
10223	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Now the other que- related question, though, is - is,	no
10224	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	for these things?	no
10225	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Th- th- the boot models	no
10226	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So, we start with a,	no
10227	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um,	no
10228	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	alil- alignment	no
10229	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	that we computed with the b- sort of the best system we have.	no
10230	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And -	no
10231	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and then we train from scratch. So we com- we do a,	no
10232	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	you know, w- um -	no
10233	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	We collect the -	no
10234	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh,	no
10235	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the observations	no
10236	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	from those alignments under each of the feature	no
10237	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	sets that - that we	no
10238	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And then,	no
10239	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	from there we do,	no
10240	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um -	no
10241	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	There's a lot of, actually -	no
10242	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	The way it works, you first train a phonetically-tied	no
10243	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	mixture model.	no
10244	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Um.	no
10245	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	You do a total of -	no
10246	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	First you do a context-independent	no
10247	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	P_T_M model. Then you switch to a context -	no
10248	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	You do two iterations of that.	no
10249	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Then you do two iterations of - of - of context-	no
10250	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	phonetically-tied mixtures.	no
10251	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And then from that you - you do the -	no
10252	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	you - you go to a state-clustered model,	no
10253	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10254	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and you do four iterations of that. So there's a	no
10255	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	original boot models and the final models. I don't think that -	no
10256	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Hmm.	no
10257	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	We have never seen big	no
10258	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	"differences. Once I thought ""oh, I can -"	no
10259	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Now I have these	no
10260	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Made no difference whatsoever. It's -	no
10261	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
10262	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I think it's - eh, i-	no
10263	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the boot models are	no
10264	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, mis- for making things	no
10265	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	this for making things	no
10266	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	no
10267	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	used a comple- used a different feature set,	no
10268	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	no
10269	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	that -	no
10270	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But there	no
10271	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	You - you're not booting from initial models. You're booting from initial alignments.	no
10272	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Which you got from a different feature set.	no
10273	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	That's correct.	no
10274	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So, those features	no
10275	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah, but -	no
10276	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I mean, you know, they - they will find boundaries a little differently, though - You know, all th- all that sort of thing is actually slightly different.	no
10277	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I'd expect it to be a minor effect, but -	no
10278	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But - but - but, what I'm - what I'm saying is -	no
10279	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So,	no
10280	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	we e-	no
10281	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	w- f- w-	no
10282	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	For a long time we had used boot alignments	no
10283	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	that	no
10284	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	had been trained with a -	no
10285	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	with the same	no
10286	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	like, fifteen percent worse than what we use now.	no
10287	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	no
10288	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And with a dict- different dictionary - with a	no
10289	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	no
10290	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10291	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And so,	no
10292	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	then we switched to new boot alignments, which - which now had the benefit of all these	no
10293	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	improvements that we've made over two years in the system.	no
10294	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
10295	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And,	no
10296	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the result in the end was no different.	no
10297	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
10298	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So, what I'm saying is, the exact nature of these boot alignments is	no
10299	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	probably not	no
10300	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah, maybe not.	no
10301	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But	no
10302	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10303	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	there's - there's a history to this, too, but I - uh, I don't wanna go into, but -	no
10304	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	no
10305	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	but I - I - I th- I think it	no
10306	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the things	no
10307	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the	no
10308	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
10309	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh, that	no
10310	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	a beginning	no
10311	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	is	no
10312	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
10313	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But,	no
10314	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10315	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	it's - it's - that's probably not it.	no
10316	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Anyway, I - I - I should really reserve,	no
10317	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh,	no
10318	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	any conclusions until we've done it on the	no
10319	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	large training set,	no
10320	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um, and until we've seen the results with the - with the V_T_L in training.	no
10321	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So.	no
10322	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah. At	no
10323	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10324	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh, some Broadcast News data or something else that actually has - has some noisy -	no
10325	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	noisy components, so we can see	no
10326	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	if any conclusions we come to holds	no
10327	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
10328	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Uh -	no
10329	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And, uh, with	no
10330	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Hmm!	no
10331	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K.	no
10332	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Uh. Just what we were talking about before, which is that I	no
10333	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	ported a	no
10334	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and then got -	no
10335	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	got it working with fast-forward,	no
10336	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and got	no
10337	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Oh.	no
10338	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	a speedup roughly proportional to the number of processors times the clock cycle. So, that's pretty good.	no
10339	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Oh!	no
10340	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Cool.	no
10341	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Um, I'm in the process of doing it for Quicknet, but there's something going wrong and it's about half the speed that	no
10342	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I was estimating it	no
10343	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	no
10344	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But I'll keep working on it. But the -	no
10345	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	what it means is that it's likely that for net training and forward passes,	no
10346	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	we'll -	no
10347	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Absinthe will be a good machine.	no
10348	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Especially if we get a few more processors and upgrade the processors.	no
10349	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	A few more processors? How many are you shooting for?	no
10350	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	There're five now. It can hold eight.	no
10351	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Oh, O_K.	no
10352	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah, we'll just go buy	no
10353	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And it's also five-fifty megahertz and you can get a	no
10354	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10355	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So.	no
10356	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Can you mix	no
10357	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I	no
10358	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	speed?	no
10359	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K.	no
10360	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Probably just throw away the old ones, and -	no
10361	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yep.	no
10362	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Thank you	no
10363	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Oh, O_K.	no
10364	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Hmm!	no
10365	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Maybe we can stick them in another system. I dunno.	no
10366	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	We'd have to get a -	no
10367	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	almost certainly have to get a, uh, Netfinity server.	no
10368	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I see.	no
10369	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	They're	no
10370	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	pretty -	no
10371	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	pretty specialized.	no
10372	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10373	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K.	no
10374	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K.	no

10376	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I don't know.	no
10377	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I dunno.	no
10378	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah. Oh, you don't. O_K.	no
10379	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Uh, I - I will.	no
10380	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Alright.	no
10381	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I - I actually have to run this stuff.	no
10382	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Alright.	yes
10383	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	See you.	no
10384	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Um.	no
10385	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Uh, they're having tea out there. So I guess the other thing that we were gonna talk about is - is, uh, demo.	no
10386	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And, um, so, these are the demos for the	no
10387	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh, meeting	no
10388	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um -	no
10389	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	July what?	no
10390	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	DARPA mee-	no
10391	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Early July? Late July?	no
10392	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Oh, I think it's July fifteenth. Is that it?	no
10393	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Sixteen to eighteen, I think.	no
10394	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah, sixteenth, eighteenth.	no
10395	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Roughly.	no
10396	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah. So, we talked about getting something together for that, but maybe, uh -	no
10397	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	maybe we'll just put that off for now, given that -	no
10398	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But I think maybe we should have a -	no
10399	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	a sub-meeting,	no
10400	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I think,	no
10401	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh,	no
10402	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	probably, uh,	no
10403	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Adam and -	no
10404	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and, uh, Chuck and me	no
10405	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	should talk about -	no
10406	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	should get together and talk about that sometime soon.	no
10407	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Over a cappuccino tomorrow?	no
10408	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah	no
10409	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh, you know, maybe -	no
10410	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	maybe we'll involve Dan Ellis at some -	no
10411	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	no
10412	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	some level as well.	no
10413	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Um.	no
10414	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K. The -	no
10415	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the tea is - is going, so, uh, I suggest we do, uh -	no
10416	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh, a unison.	yes
10417	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	A unison digits?	no
10418	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10419	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Which is gonna be a little hard for a couple people because we have different digits forms.	no
10420	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Gets	no
10421	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Oops.	no
10422	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	We have a -	no
10423	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I found a couple of old ones.	no
10424	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Hmm.	no
10425	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Oh.	no
10426	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well,	no
10427	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	that'll be interesting. So, uh -	no
10428	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Have you done digits before?	no
10429	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	No.	no
10430	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I haven't done it.	no
10431	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K. So, uh,	no
10432	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the idea is just to read each line	no
10433	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Alright.	no
10434	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	between lines, not between -	no
10435	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And, uh, since we're in a hurry, we were just gonna read everyone all at once. So, if you sorta plug your ears and read -	no
10436	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K.	no
10437	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So first read the transcript number,	no
10438	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and then start reading the	no
10439	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Sure.	no
10440	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K?	no

10546	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	If we can't, we can't. But uh we're gonna try to make this an abbreviated meeting cuz the -	no

10548	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Um.	no
10549	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So.	yes
10550	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Agenda is - according to this, is transcription status, DARPA demos	no

10554	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K.	no
10555	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Should we just go in order? Transcription status? Who's - that's probably you.	no
10556	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I can do that quickly. Um I hired several more transcribers, They're making great progress. Seve-	no
10557	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Seven?	no
10558	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	And uh -	no
10559	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	and uh,	no
10560	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	uh I've been uh finishing up the uh double checking.	no
10561	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I hoped to have had that done by today but it's gonna take one more week.	no
10562	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Um	no
10563	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I g-	no
10564	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	as a	no
10565	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	could I get a hold of uh	no
10566	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	the data even if it's not really corrected yet just so I can get the data formats	no
10567	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	and make sure the information retrieval stuff is working?	no
10568	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Certainly. Yeah I mean, it's in the same place it's been.	no
10569	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So can you just -	no
10570	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Uh-huh. No change.	no
10571	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Uh -	no
10572	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	is the sub-directory?	no

10574	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K.	no
10575	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So I'll - I'll probably just make some copies of those rather than use the ones that are there.	no

10577	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Um and then	no
10578	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	just - we'll have to remember to	no

10580	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K.	no
10581	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K, wh-	no
10582	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I also got anot- a short remark to the transcription. I've uh just processed the first five E_D_U meetings and they are chunked up so they would - they probably can be sent to I_B_M	no
10583	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	whenever they want them.	no
10584	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Well the second one of those	no
10585	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Cool.	no
10586	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yep. It's already at I_B_M, but the other ones - Yeah.	no
10587	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	is already at I_B_M.	no
10588	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	That's the one that	no
10589	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
10590	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
10591	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K.	no
10592	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	These are	no
10593	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	As soon as -	no
10594	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	They're the I_B_M set.	no
10595	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	It's	no
10596	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yep.	no
10597	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Excellent. Good.	no
10598	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
10599	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	And so as soon as we hear	no
10600	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	from Brian	no
10601	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	that	no
10602	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	this one is O_K and we get the transcript back and we find out that	no
10603	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	hopefully there are no problems matching up the transcript	no
10604	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	with what we	no
10605	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	them,	no
10606	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	then uh we'll be ready to go and we'll just send them the next four as a big batch,	no
10607	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Excellent.	no
10608	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	and let them work on that.	no
10609	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	And so we're doing those as disjoint from the ones we're transcribing here?	no
10610	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yes, exactly. We're sort of doing things in parallel, that way we can get as much done a- at once. Yeah.	no
10611	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K, good.	no
10612	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah, I think that's the right way to do it, especially for the information retrieval stuff.	no
10613	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Anything else on transcription status?	no
10614	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Hm-mmm.	no
10615	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K.	yes
10616	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	DARPA demos, we had the submeeting the other day.	no
10617	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Right, which uh -	no
10618	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So I've been working on using the THISL tools to do information retrieval on meeting data	no
10619	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	and the THISL tools are -	no
10620	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	there're two sets, there's a back-end and a front-end, so the front-end is the user interface and the back-end is the indexing tool and the querying tool.	no
10621	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	And so I've written some tools to convert everything into the right for- file formats.	no
10622	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	And the	no
10623	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	command line version of the indexing and the querying is now working.	no
10624	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So at least on the	no
10625	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	uh	no
10626	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	uh of hits.	no
10627	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	What - what kind of uh - what does that look like? The string that you type in. What are you - are you - are they keywords, or are they - ? O_K.	no
10628	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Keywords.	no
10629	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I see.	no
10630	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Right? And so - and then it munges it to pass it to the THISL I_R which uses an S_G_M_L-like	no
10631	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	format for everything.	no
10632	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	And then	no
10633	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	does it play something back or that's something you're having to program?	no
10634	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Um, right now, I have a tool that will	no
10635	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
10636	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	but my intention is to do a prettier user interface based	no
10637	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So - so that's the other thing I wanted to	no
10638	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Mm-hmm.	no
10639	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	um, which I haven't used, haven't looked at. Dan says it's pretty good	no
10640	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Mm-hmm.	no
10641	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	but it	no
10642	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Mm-hmm.	no
10643	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	And so it - it's pretty big and complex.	no
10644	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Uh and it would be difficult to port to Windows because it means porting the	no
10645	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Mm-hmm.	no
10646	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Uh the other option is Dan did the Tcl-T_K THISL GUI front-end	no
10647	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
10648	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	for Broadcast News which I think looks great. I think that's a nice demo.	no
10649	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Um and that would be much easier to port to Windows.	no
10650	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	And so I think	no
10651	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I - Can I ask a question? So um	no
10652	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Mm-hmm.	no
10653	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	as it stands within the - the Channeltrans interface, it's	no
10654	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	You can find a searched string and play. So e- Are you - So you're adding like um,	no
10655	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I don't know, uh are they fuzzy matches or are they	no
10656	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	It's a sort of standard,	no
10657	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	text-retrieval-based -	no
10658	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So it's uh term frequency, inverse document frequency scoring.	no
10659	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K.	no
10660	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Um	no
10661	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	and then there are all sorts of metrics for spacing how far apart they have to be and things like that.	no
10662	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So it - it's	no
10663	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	It's a lot more sophisticated than the uh	no
10664	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	i-	no
10665	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	it's like doing a Google query or anyth- anything else like that.	no
10666	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	the basically Windows-based -	no
10667	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So i- it uses - So it pr- produces an index ahead of time so you don't - you're not doing a linear search through all the documents.	no
10668	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K.	no
10669	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Cuz you can imagine if - with - if we have the sixty hours' worth you do - wouldn't wanna do a search.	no
10670	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Hm-mmm.	no
10671	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Um you have to do preindexing and so that - these tools do all that.	no
10672	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Good.	no
10673	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	And so the work to get the	no
10674	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	well -	no
10675	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	uh to get it to work on the	no
10676	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	rewriting them and modifying them	no
10677	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	to work for	no
10678	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Mm-hmm.	no
10679	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Mm-hmm.	no
10680	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	sorta things like that.	no
10681	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Mm-hmm.	no
10682	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So what does the user see as the result of the query?	no
10683	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	On	no
10684	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	THISL.	no
10685	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	The THISL GUI tool which is the one that Dan wrote, Tcl-T_K	no
10686	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
10687	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	um you type in a query and then you get back a list	no
10688	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	of hits	no
10689	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	and you can type on them and listen to them.	no
10690	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Ah.	no
10691	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	"So if you typed in ""small heads"" or something you could"	no
10692	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Mmm	no
10693	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Right, you'd get -	no
10694	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	get back a uh uh	no
10695	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	something that would let you click and listen to some audio where that phrase had occurred or some-	no
10696	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	"You - you'd get to listen to ""beep""."	no
10697	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	That was a really good look.	no
10698	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	You couldn't get a video.	no
10699	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Guess who I practice on?	no
10700	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	At	no
10701	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
10702	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	And then again, maybe not. So,	no
10703	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah, that soun- that sounds reasonable. Yeah, it loo- it - my - my recollection of it is it's - it's a pretty reasonable	no
10704	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Right.	no
10705	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	uh demo sort of format.	no
10706	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah that sounds good. That sounds really neat.	no
10707	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	And so I think	no
10708	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	there'd be minimal effort to get it to work,	no
10709	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Um Dave Gelbart expressed some interest in working on that so I'll work with him on it.	no
10710	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	And it - it's looking pretty good, you know, the fact that I got the query system working.	no
10711	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So if we wanna just do a video-based one I think that'll be easy.	no
10712	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Mm-hmm.	no
10713	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	If we wanna get it to Windows it's gonna be a little more work because the	no
10714	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	THISL	no
10715	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I_R, the information retrieval tool's - um, I had difficulty just compiling them on Solaris.	no
10716	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Mm-hmm.	no
10717	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So getting them to compile on	no
10718	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Windows might be challenging.	no
10719	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Mm-hmm.	no
10720	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	But you were saying that - that the uh -	no
10721	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So.	no
10722	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	that there's that set of tools, uh,	no
10723	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	It certainly helps. Um, I mean	no
10724	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Uh-huh.	no
10725	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
10726	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Mm-hmm.	no
10727	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	But what those - they - what those do is provide sort of a B_S_D compatibility layer,	no
10728	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	so that the normal UNIX function calls all work.	no
10729	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Mm-hmm.	no
10730	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Mm-hmm.	no
10731	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Um,	no
10732	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	And you have to have all the o-	no
10733	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	But the	no
10734	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	and so you have the normal porting problems of	no
10735	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	different header files and th- some things are defined and some things aren't	no
10736	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	and uh	no
10737	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	different compiler work-arounds and so on. So the fact that	no
10738	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	um it took me a day to get it c- to compile under	no
10739	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	s- significantly	no
10740	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	How about having it run under	no
10741	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Well what you need -	no
10742	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Free B_S_D would probably be easier.	no
10743	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	All you need to do is say to Dan	no
10744	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	"""gee it would be nice if this worked under"	no
10745	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Right?	no
10746	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Uh -	no
10747	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Actually you know I should	no
10748	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	so he might have	no
10749	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Right.	no
10750	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I - I - I wouldn't be surprised.	no
10751	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So -	no
10752	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I'll check at that -	no
10753	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	How does it play?	no
10754	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	What I -	no
10755	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	But it would - what would serve - would serve both purposes, is if you contact him and ask him if he's already done it.	no
10756	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah, right.	no
10757	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	If he has then you learn, if he hasn't then he'll	no
10758	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Right.	no
10759	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Wow.	no
10760	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I hope he never listens to these meetings.	no
10761	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So, and I've been corresponding with Dan and also with uh	no
10762	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	It's amazing.	no
10763	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
10764	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	uh,	no
10765	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Blanking on his name.	no
10766	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Tony Robinson?	no
10767	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Tony Robinson?	no
10768	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Do I mean Tony? I guess I	no
10769	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
10770	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Or S- or Steve Renals.	no
10771	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	James Christie.	no
10772	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Which one do I mean?	no
10773	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Steve Renal- Steve Renals.	no
10774	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Steve Renals is not SoftSound, is he?	no
10775	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	No.	no
10776	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	My brain is not working, I don't remember who I've been corresponding with.	no
10777	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K.	no
10778	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Steve wro- i- it's Ste- Steve Renals wrote	no
10779	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	THISL I_R.	no
10780	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Then it's Steve Renals.	no
10781	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K.	no
10782	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Oh, O_K.	no
10783	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So uh just getting documentation and uh and f- and formats, so that's all going pretty well, I think we'll be O_K with that.	no
10784	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
10785	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Right.	no
10786	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Assuming we're -	no
10787	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	What about issues of playing	no
10788	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Um	no
10789	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	we have -	no
10790	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Well,	no
10791	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Here's a - here's a crazy idea	no
10792	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I don't know.	no
10793	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Why don't you try and merge	no
10794	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Well this is one of the reasons -	no
10795	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	They're both Tcl interfaces.	no
10796	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	This is the - one of the reasons that I'm gonna have uh Dave Gelbart - Gelbart -	no
10797	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Having him volunteer to work on it is a really good thing	no
10798	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	because he's worked on the Transcriber stuff	no
10799	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Right.	no
10800	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	and he's more familiar with Tcl-T_K than I am.	no
10801	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	And then you get - they - then you get the Windows media playing for free.	no
10802	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Well that's	no
10803	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah, yeah, I mean, I - I think THISL - THISL GUI	no
10804	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	And so my intention was just to base it on that.	no
10805	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
10806	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Well my thought was is that it would be nice - it would be nice to have the running transcripts	no
10807	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	And if it	no
10808	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	um eh you know, from speaker to speaker.	no
10809	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Right? Do you have - you have, you know, a speaker mark here and a speaker mark here?	no
10810	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Right, we'll have to figure out a user interface for that, so.	no
10811	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Right.	no
10812	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Well that - eh my thought was if you had like Multitrans or whatever	no
10813	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Or whatever.	no
10814	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
10815	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	It might be	no
10816	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	the little short segments we'd be talking about and having	no
10817	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	the search tools and so on. We - we can look into it, but -	no
10818	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
10819	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	The thing I was asking about with, um, free B_S_D is that it might be easier to	no
10820	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	get PowerPoint shows	no
10821	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	running in free B_S_D than to get this other package running in -	no
10822	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah, I mean we have to - I have to sit down and	no
10823	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
10824	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Um	no
10825	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	My experience with the Gnu compatibility library is	no
10826	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	it's just as hard and just as easy to port to any system.	no
10827	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Right? The Windows system isn't any harder because it - it looks like a B_S_D system.	no
10828	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Mm-hmm.	no
10829	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	"It's just, you know, just like all of them, the ""include"" files are a little different and the function calls are a little different."	no
10830	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Right.	no
10831	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So I - it	no
10832	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K.	no
10833	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So there was	no
10834	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	um some	no
10835	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	um showing off the - the Transcriber interface	no
10836	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	uh - and part of that was showing off what the speech-non- uh nonspeech	no
10837	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
10838	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Can I ask one more thing about THISL?	no
10839	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Mm-hmm.	no
10840	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So with the I_R stuff then you end up with a somewhat prioritized um - ?	no
10841	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Mm-hmm, ranked.	no
10842	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Excellent. Excellent.	no
10843	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
10844	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So	no
10845	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	just now actually for the	no
10846	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	whether it might be of interest to sh- to show some of the prosody uh	no
10847	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	work that	no
10848	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Mm-hmm.	no
10849	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Um actually show some of the	no
10850	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Um,	no
10851	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	you know, you can show that	no
10852	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Well I think at -	no
10853	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I don't know if that would be of interest or not.	no
10854	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	at the very least we're gonna want something	no
10855	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
10856	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	it's much better than me just having a bullet point	no
10857	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	pointing at something I don't	no
10858	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I mean, you're looking at this now - Are you looking at Waves or Matlab?	no
10859	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Um yeah I'm	no
10860	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	um -	no
10861	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah we can	no
10862	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	of different type of prosodic	no
10863	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah def-	no
10864	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	events going on.	no
10865	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	S- so when we here were having this demo meeting, what we're	no
10866	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I-	no
10867	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	and then that'll give us a week or so.	no
10868	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Oh, the end of	no
10869	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Ooo. The end of -	no
10870	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Oh, you mean like	no
10871	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Ju-	no
10872	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Oh.	no
10873	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Oh sorry,	no
10874	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	June. June. June.	no
10875	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
10876	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	There's another one.	no
10877	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Exactly.	no
10878	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Uh -	no
10879	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	that'll - that'll give us -	no
10880	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Sorry.	no
10881	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	that'll give us a week or so to uh - to port things over to my laptop and make sure	no
10882	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I think, I mean eh where -	no
10883	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah, I mean	no
10884	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah if d- if Don can sort of talk to whoever's - cuz we're doing this anyway as part of our -	no
10885	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
10886	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	you know, the	no
10887	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
10888	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	it might not be integrated but it -	no
10889	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	it could potentially be in it.	no
10890	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Could find some.	no
10891	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah. Well, this is to an audience of researchers so I mean, you know,	no
10892	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	to let s- the goal is to let them know what it is we're doing. So that's -	no
10893	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I mean it's	yes
10894	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
10895	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Good.	no
10896	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Done with that.	no
10897	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	X_M_L tools?	no
10898	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Um.	no
10899	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So I've been doing a bunch of X_M_L tools where you - we're sort of moving to X_M_L as the	no
10900	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	general format for everything and I think that's definitely the right way to go because there are a lot of tools	no
10901	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	that let you do extraction and reformatting of X_M_L tools.	no
10902	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Um.	no
10903	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So yet again we should probably meet to talk about	no
10904	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I mean it works with	no
10905	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	uh because it doesn't mark start and end.	no
10906	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Start and end of each - ?	no
10907	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Uh -	no
10908	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
10909	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Utterance.	no
10910	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Utterance. Just marks - ?	no
10911	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So it's	no
10912	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
10913	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Right.	no
10914	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	And so - and also I'd like to do the indirect time line business.	no
10915	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Um but	no
10916	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	but I've installed X_M_L tools of various sorts in various languages and so if people are interested in doing -	no
10917	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	extracting any information from	no
10918	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I'm converting the Key files to X_M_L so that you can extract m- uh	no
10919	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Cool.	no
10920	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	various inf- uh sorted information on individual	no
10921	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
10922	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	and then also the	no
10923	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	but we can get other languages too if - if that's desirable.	no
10924	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Oh, quick	no
10925	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	In - in the Key files now?	no
10926	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Mm-hmm.	no
10927	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	The seat information is on the Key files for the ones which	no
10928	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Ah.	no
10929	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Oh in -	no
10930	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	it's been recorded, yeah.	no
10931	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	For the new one- O_K. Great.	no
10932	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Seat?	no
10933	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Sea- yeah.	no
10934	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Where - where you're sitting.	no
10935	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Oh! Not - not the	no
10936	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Right.	no
10937	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
10938	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
10939	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K.	no
10940	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Oh, but	no
10941	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K.	no
10942	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Um.	no
10943	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Alright.	no
10944	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	That's more seat information than we wanted.	no
10945	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Never mind.	no
10946	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Hmm.	no
10947	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I'm just trying to figure out, you know, when Morgan's voice appears on someone's microphone are they	no
10948	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Maybe we should bleep that out.	no
10949	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
10950	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Mmm, yeah.	no
10951	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Wait a minute, how - how w- eh	no
10952	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Right.	no
10953	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
10954	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	The square bracket.	no
10955	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Cuz	no
10956	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I mean	no
10957	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	You	no
10958	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Well bu-	no
10959	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Oh, O_K.	no
10960	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Isn't it always on the	no
10961	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Isn't it always on the digits forms?	no
10962	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Well	no
10963	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah so we can go back and fill	no
10964	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Ooo.	no
10965	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I mean they're on th- right,	no
10966	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah I - I never -	no
10967	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I never knew we were supposed to put it in the Key file.	no
10968	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I	no
10969	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Oh, so we're both sorry. So -	no
10970	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Oh really?	no
10971	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I mean this is why I wanna use a g- a tool to do it rather than the plain text because with the plain text it's very easy to skip those things.	no
10972	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K.	no
10973	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K.	no
10974	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K.	no
10975	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So.	no
10976	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Um if you use the Edit-key,	no
10977	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	or Key-edit - I think it's Edit-key,	no
10978	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Edit-key.	no
10979	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	command -	no
10980	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Did I show you guys that?	no
10981	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yep.	no
10982	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I	no
10983	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	You	no
10984	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	"text file"". Um it has it in there, a place to fill it in."	no
10985	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Text.	no
10986	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K.	no
10987	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K.	no
10988	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah, and so if you don't fill it in, you're not gonna get it in the meetings. So.	no
10989	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So if -	no
10990	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Right. Well I - I just realized I hadn't been doing it and probably - So -	no
10991	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yep.	no
10992	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	u-	no
10993	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah and then the other thing also that Thilo noticed is, on the microphone,	no
10994	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	on channel zero it says hand-held mike	no
10995	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
10996	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Right.	no
10997	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	you actually have to	no
10998	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I know - Yeah, I usually delete the -	no
10999	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I don't, maybe I forgot to d-	no
11000	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Oh! O_K. I didn't do that	no
11001	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
11002	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Takes me no time at all to edit these.	no
11003	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	But it's almost -	no
11004	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
11005	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah that's cuz you kn- I - I know	no
11006	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I'm not	no
11007	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	And I was - I was looking at	no
11008	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Ah, O_K.	no
11009	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Uh -	no
11010	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	And so that's also a problem.	no
11011	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So	no
11012	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	We will do better.	no
11013	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	That's it.	no
11014	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Oh uh also I'm working on another version of this tool,	no
11015	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	the - the one that shows up here,	no
11016	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	that will flash yellow if the mike isn't connected.	no
11017	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	And it's not quite ready to go yet because um	no
11018	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	it's hard to	no
11019	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	the best quality ones, the Crown ones,	no
11020	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	are about the same level if they're off	no
11021	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	and no one's o- off or if they're on and no one's talking.	no
11022	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Huh.	no
11023	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Um these -	no
11024	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	are much easier, there's a bigger difference.	no
11025	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So I'm working on that and it - it sorta works and so eventually we will change to that and then you'll be able to see graphically if your mike is dropping in or out.	no
11026	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Will that also include like batteries dying?	no
11027	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yep.	no
11028	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Just a- any time the mike's putting out zeros basically.	no
11029	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yep.	no
11030	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yep.	no
11031	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	But with the	no
11032	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Now -	no
11033	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	But y- yeah.	no
11034	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Well I'll turn off the screensaver	no
11035	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
11036	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
11037	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Oops.	no
11038	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Um the	no
11039	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	the	no
11040	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	but of course no one ever pays	no
11041	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	is more easy to notice.	no
11042	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	It would be nice if - if these had little	no
11043	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Uh buzzer.	no
11044	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah, a buzzer.	no
11045	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Small shocks	no
11046	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
11047	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Actually -	no
11048	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K.	no
11049	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Oh -	yes
11050	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Oh -	no
11051	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K, disk backup, et cetera?	no
11052	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Um I spoke with Dave Johnson about putting all the Meeting Recorder stuff on non-backed-up disk to save the overhead of backup	no
11053	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	"and he pretty much said ""yeah, you could do that if you want"""	no
11054	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	but he thought it was a bad idea.	no
11055	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	In fact what	no
11056	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	doing the manual one,	no
11057	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	doing uh N_W archive to copy it	no
11058	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	is a good idea	no
11059	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	and we should do that	no
11060	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	He w- he's a firm believer in - in lots of different modalities of backup.	no
11061	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I mean, his point was well taken. This data cannot be recovered.	no
11062	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
11063	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	And so if a mistake is made and we lose the backup	no
11064	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	we should have the	no
11065	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Well I guess it	no
11066	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	not gonna -	no
11067	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	if it's stationary it's not going to go through the increment- it's not gonna burden things in the incremental backups.	no
11068	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Just - just the monthly full.	no
11069	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Hmm.	no
11070	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah, so the monthly full will be a bear but -	no
11071	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah. But he said	no
11072	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	that -	no
11073	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	that we sh-	no
11074	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	that we're getting a new backup system and we're far enough away from saturation on full backups that it's w-	no
11075	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	And uh, so the only issue here is the timing between	no
11076	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	getting more disks and	no
11077	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	uh	no
11078	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	recording meetings.	no
11079	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So I guess the idea is that we would be reserving the	no
11080	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	non-backed-up space for things	no
11081	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	that took less than twenty-four hours to recreate or something like that, right?	no
11082	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Things that are recreatable easily and also - Yeah, basically things that are	no
11083	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
11084	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
11085	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	The expanded files and things like that.	no
11086	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	They take up a lot more room anyway.	no
11087	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
11088	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Uh but we do need more disk.	no
11089	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So we can get more disk. Yeah. So.	no
11090	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
11091	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	And I - I think I agree with him.	no
11092	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	if we lose one of these we cannot get it back.	no
11093	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K.	no
11094	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I don't think there was any other et	no
11095	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Well I was allowing someone else to come up with something related that they had uh -	no
11096	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I	no
11097	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Um	no
11098	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
11099	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Because you have to copy it down to the P_C and then	no
11100	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	burn it and that's a multi-step procedure.	no
11101	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	And second of all the - the write-once burners as opposed to a professional press don't last.	no
11102	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
11103	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So I think burning them for	no
11104	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	but burning them for	no
11105	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I see.	no
11106	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Cuz th- they - they	no
11107	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K.	no
11108	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Alright.	no
11109	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I	no
11110	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I wanted to ask, I know that uh that Thilo you were, um,	no
11111	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	bringing the Channeltrans interface onto the Windows machine?	no
11112	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah it's - it - Basically it's done, yeah.	no
11113	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	And I wanted to know is th-	no
11114	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	It's all done? That's g- wonderful. Great.	no
11115	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
11116	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yes, since Tcl-T_K	no
11117	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah it -	no
11118	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	things'll just work.	no
11119	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah, it was just a problem with the Snack version and the Transcriber version but	no
11120	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	it's solved. So.	no
11121	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Does - and that - does that mean, I -	no
11122	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	maybe I should know this but I don't. Does this mean that the - that this could be por- uh ported to a Think-Pad note- or some other type of uh -	no
11123	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah, basically uh I	no
11124	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	did install it on my laptop and yeah	no
11125	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Wonderful.	no
11126	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	it worked.	yes
11127	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Hmm!	no
11128	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Wonderful.	no
11129	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	CrossPads?	no
11130	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Uh got an email from uh	no
11131	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	"James Landay who basically said ""if you're not using them,"	no
11132	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	"could you return them?"""	no
11133	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So he said he doesn't need them, he just	no
11134	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	periodically w- at the end of each term sends out email to everyone who was recorded as having them	no
11135	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	and asks them if they're still using them.	no
11136	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So we've	no
11137	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	We used them once.	no
11138	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	We - we used them a couple times, but -	no
11139	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Once?	no
11140	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Mm-hmm.	no
11141	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Them? There's more than one?	no
11142	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Couple times.	no
11143	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah, we have two.	no
11144	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
11145	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	i-	no
11146	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Um.	no
11147	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	But -	no
11148	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	so	no
11149	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	um and	no
11150	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	And I have - uh so my - my feeling on it is that I think in	no
11151	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I - the	no
11152	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I think the	no
11153	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So you have ka- kaplunk, kaplunk, kaplunk.	no
11154	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	And I - and I don't know if it's audible on the -	no
11155	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	but I - I sort of thought that was a disadvantage. I	no
11156	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I don't know.	no
11157	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Uh, what	no
11158	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So it's - it's um - it's a regular pad, just a regular pad of paper but there's this	no
11159	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Thank you.	no
11160	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	which indicates	no
11161	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	And so you have time and position	no
11162	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K.	no
11163	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	stuff	no
11164	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K.	no
11165	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	And then you can download it and they have O_C_R and searching and all sorts of things.	no
11166	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K.	no
11167	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K.	no
11168	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So i- if you take notes it's a great little device.	no
11169	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Could - Mm-hmm.	no
11170	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	But I don't take notes, so.	no
11171	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	And one of the reasons that it was brought	no
11172	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	so forth and the question is if you were going to go to some gold	no
11173	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	you know, where would it	no
11174	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
11175	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yep.	no
11176	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
11177	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	things, right? And so the - it seemed like a neat	no
11178	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	have somebody uh take good notes and then that's part of the record of the meeting.	no
11179	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	And then we did it once or twice and we sort of -	no
11180	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yep, and then just sort of died out.	no
11181	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	probably chose the wrong	no
11182	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I mean -	no
11183	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah that's right.	no
11184	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Well I	no
11185	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yep.	no
11186	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
11187	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	u-	no
11188	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	but I guess the - the	no
11189	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	thing I'm thinking is if we wanted that kind of thing I wonder if we'd	no
11190	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	taking notes in some other interface.	no
11191	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I mean we're	no
11192	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Oh it's la- it's	no
11193	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Because that's	no
11194	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I think -	no
11195	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Summary.	no
11196	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	there's also -	no
11197	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	there's this use that -	no
11198	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Summarize it from the	no
11199	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	the -	no
11200	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Well, what if you're sitting there and you just wanna make an X_ and you	no
11201	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Doodle.	no
11202	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	you know, and - and then while you're	no
11203	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	But -	no
11204	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	in - in other words you can use that just to	no
11205	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	in a very simple way. Also with - I was thinking and I know Morgan disagrees with me on this but	no
11206	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	suppose you have a group in here and you wanna let them note whenever they think there	no
11207	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	they could just sort of	no
11208	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	make an X_ near that point or a question mark that	no
11209	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	sort of alerts	no
11210	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	could get some red flags in that	no
11211	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I know we haven't been using it but	no
11212	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I can	no
11213	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Right.	no
11214	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	get back in a	no
11215	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Well.	no
11216	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I guess -	no
11217	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	so, you know, what - what	no
11218	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	and put some kind of summary or something uh you know, some - there'd be some scribe	no
11219	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	who would actually listen, w- who'd agreed to actually listen to the whole thing,	no
11220	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	But -	no
11221	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	then you don't - you	no
11222	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	the	no
11223	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Right.	no
11224	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	uh that you'd have if you had it live.	no
11225	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	And you don't have a lot of other	no
11226	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
11227	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	How do you synchronize the time in the	no
11228	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I mean that was one of the issues we	no
11229	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	part of the	no
11230	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Uh.	no
11231	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Mm-hmm.	no
11232	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	You know you want it pretty	no
11233	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Well when - when I d-	no
11234	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	and so you -	no
11235	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K.	no
11236	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	so you have to synchronize at the beginning of each meeting all the pads that are being	no
11237	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	so that it's synchronized with the time on	no
11238	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	download to an	no
11239	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	figure out what the	no
11240	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	And so there's a lot of	no
11241	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Why -	no
11242	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	unless someone -	no
11243	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	There	no
11244	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	it	no
11245	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I mean, I - when I - when	no
11246	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Hmm.	no
11247	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Well, but then there's the infrastructure at the other	no
11248	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Right.	no
11249	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah, it's transcribed. It's in the transcript.	no
11250	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	and then	no
11251	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So.	no
11252	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
11253	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Well it's in the transcript.	no
11254	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Well, could we keep	no
11255	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	We can keep all -	no
11256	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	just - just in case we -	no
11257	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	even maybe some of the transcribers who might be wanting to	no
11258	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	uh f- just there's a bunch of things that might be neat to do but I -	no
11259	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	it	no
11260	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	synchronize them and then do all the infrastructure but we could at least try it	no
11261	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Well -	no
11262	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	one thing that we might try	no
11263	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	um	no
11264	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	is on some set of meetings, some collection of meetings, maybe E_D_U is the right one or maybe something else,	no
11265	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	we - we get somebody to buy into the idea of doing this as part of the task. I mean,	no
11266	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Right.	no
11267	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	uh part of the reason - I think part of the reason that Adam was so interested in uh the SpeechCorder sort of f- idea from the beginning is he said from the beginning he hated taking notes and -	no
11268	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yep.	no
11269	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	and so forth so and - and Jane	no
11270	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	you know I don't know if you wanna really do -	no
11271	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	to get someone to actually buy	no
11272	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Um -	no
11273	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	and if	no
11274	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	The p- the - the problem with the - the more extended view, all these other you know with uh quibbling about particular	no
11275	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	applications of it is that it looks like it's hard to get people to	no
11276	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	um	no
11277	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	uh routinely use it, I mean it just hasn't happened anyway.	no
11278	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	But maybe if we can get a person to -	no
11279	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah I don't think it has to be part of a- what everybody does in a meeting but it might be	no
11280	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	a useful, neat	no
11281	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	part of the project that we can, you know, show off as	no
11282	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	a mechanism for synchronizing events in time	no
11283	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	that happen that you just wanna make a note	no
11284	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	with some later browsing, just - just as a convenience, even if it's not a full-blown note taking	no
11285	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	substitute.	no
11286	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Well if you wanted to do that maybe the right architecture for it is to get a P_D_A with a wireless card.	no
11287	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	And - and that way you can synchronize very easily with the -	no
11288	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	the - the meeting because you'll be synchroni- you can synchronize with the - the Linux server	no
11289	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	and uh -	no
11290	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So what kind of input would you be - ?	no
11291	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	so - so, I mean, if you're not worried about -	no
11292	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Buttons.	no
11293	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	You'd just be pressing like a - a -	no
11294	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Well - well you have a P_D_A and may- and you could have the same sort of X_ interface or whatever, I mean, you'd have to do a little eh a little bit of coding to do it.	no
11295	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Mm-hmm.	no
11296	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	But you could imagine, I mean, if - if	no
11297	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah, that be good.	no
11298	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	secondary note-taking	no
11299	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	a P_D_A with a l- a wireless card would be the -	no
11300	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I mean even	no
11301	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I mean for what - what	no
11302	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	M- right.	no
11303	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	That would be fine too. I mean, I don't have, you know, grandiose	no
11304	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Right.	no
11305	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	well we've - we're getting into the next year now and we have a lot of these things worked out at - in terms of the	no
11306	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I like this P_D_A idea. Yeah.	no
11307	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah, I	no
11308	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Well I'm	no
11309	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
11310	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
11311	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	"and then another button was ""that's great"" and another button ""that's f-"""	no
11312	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	"Or like this is my ""I'm supposed to do this"" kind of button, like ""I better remember to -"""	no
11313	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
11314	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Action item.	no
11315	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah something like that or -	no
11316	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I mean I think the	no
11317	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	And then -	no
11318	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Uh-huh.	no
11319	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	It's just a question of getting people to use it and getting the infrastructure set up in such a way that it's not a lot of extra work.	no
11320	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I mean that's part of the reason why it hasn't happened is that	no
11321	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
11322	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	it's been a lot of extra work for	no
11323	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Right.	no
11324	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	and -	no
11325	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Well, and not just for you. But it's also, it has this problem of having to	no
11326	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	W-	no
11327	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	go from an analog to a d-	no
11328	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	a digital record too, doesn't it? I mean -	no
11329	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Well it's	no
11330	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	But I mean, say, if i- if -	no
11331	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	is not particularly	no
11332	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	if you're writing - if you're writing notes in it does - it - it can't	no
11333	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	No, no, but it's just - it's just storing the pixel	no
11334	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K.	no
11335	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	informa- position information, it's all digital.	no
11336	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I - I guess what I'm thinking is that the P_D_A solution you h- you have it already without needing to go from the pixelization to a -	no
11337	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	to a -	no
11338	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I mean -	no
11339	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Right.	no
11340	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	You don't have to -	no
11341	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	The transfer function is less errorful, yes.	no
11342	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah, yeah.	no
11343	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
11344	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Oh, nicely put.	no
11345	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah. Yeah.	no
11346	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Well it also - it's	no
11347	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I don't know what - I don't wanna cause more work for anyone but I can imagine some interesting	no
11348	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	things that you could	no
11349	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	and we can	no
11350	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	keep it for a year -	no
11351	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Well -	no
11352	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	w- we don't - we	no
11353	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	The	no
11354	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So we have no but - uh by I - I would suggest you return one.	no
11355	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K.	no
11356	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
11357	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Because we - we you know, we - we	no
11358	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	We have some	no
11359	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	One would probably be fine.	no
11360	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Maybe we could do like a	no
11361	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
11362	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	s- project for something would be cool.	no
11363	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yep.	no
11364	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I mean if we had them out and sitting on the table people might use them a little more	no
11365	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Maybe Jeremy could sit in some meetings and press a button when there - when - when somebody laughed.	no
11366	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	although there is a little -	no
11367	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Well, I'm -	no
11368	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
11369	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Jeremy's gonna be	no
11370	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	an - he's a new student starting on modeling brea- breath and laughter, actually, which	no
11371	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
11372	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Sounds	no
11373	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K.	no
11374	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	"Breath and lau- ""ha-ha-ha-ha""."	no
11375	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	"""Ha-ha-ha."""	no
11376	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Um.	no
11377	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Hmm.	no
11378	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	That reminded me of something. Oh well, too late.	no
11379	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	It slipped out.	no
11380	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K.	no
11381	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Oh,	no
11382	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	You're - you're gonna	no
11383	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Ordered - Uh, well I'm	no
11384	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	We ordered uh more	no
11385	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Great.	no
11386	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	And then at the same time I'll probably rewire the room as per Jane's suggestion so that	no
11387	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	uh the first N_ channels are wireless, eh are the m- the close-talking and the next N_ are far-field.	no
11388	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	"You know what he means but isn't that funny sounding? ""We ordered more"	no
11389	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	That's a very philosophical	no
11390	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	statement from Morgan. I just - it's sort of a anachronism, I mean it's like -	no
11391	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	It's great.	yes
11392	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Should we do digits? Do we have anything else?	no
11393	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
11394	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K.	no
11395	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I mean there's - there's all this stuff going on uh between uh	no
11396	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Andreas and - and - and Dave and Chuck and others with various kinds of runs uh um -	no
11397	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	it's all sort of in process, so there's not much to say	no
11398	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	right now.	no
11399	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Uh why don't we start with our - our esteemed guest.	no
11400	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K.	no
11401	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Alright.	no
11402	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So just the transcript number and then the - then the -	no
11403	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	This is -	no
11404	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yes, this is number two for me today.	no
11405	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	See all you have to do is go away to move way up in the -	no
11406	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	We could do	no
11407	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	We - we	no
11408	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Should we	no
11409	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Well, I'm just thinking, are you gonna try to	no
11410	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
11411	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah, absolutely.	no
11412	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah, so we might wanna do it simultaneous.	no
11413	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I mean you hav- sorta	no

11515	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Well, I'm - I sent a couple of items. They're - they're sort of	no
11516	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I thought	no
11517	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	if - if that's too	no
11518	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah, we only want th-	no
11519	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I mean, we don't want anything too practical.	no
11520	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K.	no
11521	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Well, um, I can	no
11522	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Great.	no
11523	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Uh, maybe	no
11524	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	with reference to the	no
11525	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K,	no
11526	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K.	no
11527	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Well, we have	no
11528	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
11529	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yes.	no
11530	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I would prefer this.	no
11531	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah, well. O_K.	no
11532	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Uh -	no
11533	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	We talk about the -	no
11534	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	You have some -	no
11535	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
11536	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K.	no
11537	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I have a little bit of I_RAM stuff but	no
11538	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	use -	no
11539	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Uh, bigram?	no
11540	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I_RAM.	no
11541	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Well, m- maybe.	no
11542	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I_RAM, bigram, you know.	no
11543	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah, let's - let's see where we are at three-thirty. Um -	no
11544	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Hmm.	no
11545	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Since, uh - since I have to leave as usual at three-thirty, can we do the interesting stuff first?	no
11546	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I beg your pardon?	no
11547	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Well -	no
11548	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I beg your pardon?	no
11549	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. Th- now you get to tell us what's the interesting part. But - Yeah.	no
11550	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Please specify.	no
11551	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
11552	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Well, uh, I guess the	no
11553	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	work that's been	no
11554	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I think that would be a good thing to start with.	no
11555	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K.	no
11556	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Um, and, um,	no
11557	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	uh, one of the suggestions that came up in a brief meeting I had the other day when I was in	no
11558	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	with, uh, Manolo Pardo and	no
11559	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Javier, uh, Ferreiros, who was	no
11560	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
11561	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	was, um,	no
11562	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	why not	no
11563	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	what they had	no
11564	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	the non-silence boundaries.	no
11565	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	So, in what Javier did before when they were doing, um -	no
11566	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
11567	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Um.	no
11568	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	as, uh, a	no
11569	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
11570	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And, uh, he did not, say, look at points where you were changing broad sp- uh, phonetic class, for instance.	no
11571	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And for Broadcast News, that was fine.	no
11572	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
11573	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And, um, so one of the things that	no
11574	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	w- why are you spending so much time,	no
11575	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	uh, on the, uh,	no
11576	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	uh, when perhaps if you sort of	no
11577	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Uh-huh.	no
11578	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	and then just	no
11579	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Nnn, yeah.	no
11580	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And you - you might -	no
11581	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	So there was a - there was a little bit of a - a -	no
11582	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	a - a difference of	no
11583	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
11584	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	But, uh, on the other hand I saw that the - they had a good point that, uh,	no
11585	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	if we had something that worked for many cases before, maybe starting from there a little bit - Because	no
11586	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	with some s- su- kind of structure	no
11587	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
11588	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
11589	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	uh, there is a	no
11590	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
11591	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	so anyway, I just -	no
11592	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	So. Yeah, why don't we do the speech-nonspeech discussion?	no
11593	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
11594	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Do - I - I hear - you - you didn't -	no
11595	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Speech-nonspeech? O_K.	no
11596	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Uh-huh. Yeah.	no
11597	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Um, so, uh, what we basically did so far was using the mixed file to - to detect s- speech or nonspeech	no
11598	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
11599	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	what I did so far is I just used our old Munich system, which is an H_M_M-ba- based system with Gaussian mixtures for s- speech and nonspeech.	no
11600	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And it	no
11601	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
11602	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
11603	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	for speech and nonspeech. And I did some	no
11604	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	training on - on one dialogue, which was transcribed	no
11605	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	by -	no
11606	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Jose.	no
11607	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. We - we did a nons- s- speech-nonspeech transcription. Adam, Dave, and I, we did,	no
11608	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	for that dialogue and I trained it on that.	no
11609	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And I did some pre-segmentations for - for Jane. And I'm not sure how good they are or what - what the transcribers say. They -	no
11610	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	they can use it or - ?	no
11611	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Uh, they - they think it's a terrific improvement. And, um, it real- it just makes a - a world of difference.	no
11612	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Hmm.	no
11613	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And, um, y- you also did some- something in	no
11614	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. Uh, yeah. That - that was one - one - one thing,	no
11615	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	uh,	no
11616	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	why I added more mixtures for - for the speech. So I saw that there were	no
11617	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
11618	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	loud - loudly speaking speakers and quietly speaking speakers. And so I did two mixtures, one for the loud speakers and one for the quiet speakers.	no
11619	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And did you	no
11620	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I did that for - for five minutes of one dialogue and that was enough to - to train the system. And so it - it adapts, uh, on -	no
11621	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Right.	no
11622	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
11623	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	What - ?	no
11624	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	while running. So.	no
11625	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Hopefully.	no
11626	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	What kind of, uh, front-end processing did you do?	no
11627	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K.	no
11628	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	It's just our -	no
11629	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	our old Munich, uh, loudness-based spectrum	no
11630	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	on mel scale twenty - twenty critical bands and then loudness.	no
11631	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
11632	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And four additional features, which is energy, loudness, modified loudness, and zero crossing rate.	no
11633	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	So it's twenty-four - twenty-four features.	no
11634	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
11635	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mmm.	no
11636	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And you also provided me with	no
11637	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. Yeah.	no
11638	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And so you change	no
11639	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
11640	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	You	no
11641	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	the	no
11642	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	minimum	no
11643	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	to have, er- to have, um - yeah -	no
11644	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	to have more or less, uh, silence portions in- inserted. So.	no
11645	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Right. So this would work well for,	no
11646	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
11647	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	uh,	no
11648	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
11649	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
11650	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
11651	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
11652	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
11653	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
11654	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.	no
11655	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
11656	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	But -	no
11657	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yep.	no
11658	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	That's great.	no
11659	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Um, just qu- one quickly, uh, still on the features. So	no
11660	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	you have these twenty-four features. Uh, a lot of	no
11661	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
11662	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	No.	no
11663	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	No. W- w- we - originally we did that	no
11664	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. It was I_S two.	no
11665	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	but we saw, uh, when we used it, uh, f- for our close-talking microphone, which -	no
11666	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	yeah, for our - for our recognizer in Munich -	no
11667	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	we saw that w- it's - it's not - it's not so necessary. It - it works as well f-	no
11668	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K.	no
11669	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	with - with - without, uh, a L_D_A or something.	no
11670	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K. No, I was j-	no
11671	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
11672	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
11673	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
11674	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Right.	no
11675	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	yes
11676	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K, and - and also Da- Dave	no
11677	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	of - and w- and - so we had this meeting. Th- the	no
11678	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	um, because	no
11679	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	th- the	no
11680	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
11681	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	So we don't have start and end points	no
11682	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Well, O_K. So	no
11683	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	such that we were - at this meeting we were entertaining how we might either expand	no
11684	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	interface or find other tools which already	no
11685	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	um, ideal in my - my view and I think - I mean, I had the sense that it was consensus, is that, um,	no
11686	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	a thorough-going musical score notation would be	no
11687	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Because	no
11688	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
11689	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K. So, um,	no
11690	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	um, I spoke - I had a meeting with Dave Gelbart on - on - and he had,	no
11691	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	uh, excellent ideas on how	no
11692	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	But, um, he - in the meantime you were checking into the existence of already,	no
11693	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	um, existing interfaces which might already	no
11694	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yes. Um,	no
11695	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Munich guys from - from Ludwi- Ludwig Maximilians University, who do a lot of transcribing and transliterations.	no
11696	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
11697	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And they basically said they have -	no
11698	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	they have, uh, a tool they developed	no
11699	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	and they can't give away, uh, f- it's too error-prone, and had - it's not supported, a- a- a- and -	no
11700	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
11701	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	which she uses to do eight channels, uh, trans- transliterations, eight channels simultaneously,	no
11702	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Under Windows. Mm-hmm.	no
11703	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	So I'm not sure if - if - if we can use it. She said she would give it to us. It wouldn't be a problem.	no
11704	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
11705	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And I've got some - some kind of manual	no
11706	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Well, maybe we should	no
11707	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
11708	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	we'll arrange Windows machines to be available.	no
11709	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm. We could - uh, potentially	no
11710	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	So.	no
11711	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I mean, I've - I've	no
11712	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yep.	no
11713	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah, but then I'm not sure	no
11714	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
11715	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	No, no.	no
11716	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	No. No, Praat -	no
11717	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. Yeah.	no
11718	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Oh! I	no
11719	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
11720	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	"That's not Praat. It's called ""trans- transedit"""	no
11721	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	It's a different one.	no
11722	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K. O_K. Alright.	no
11723	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	The other thing, uh, to keep in mind, uh - I mean,	no
11724	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	we've been very concerned to get all this rolling so that we would actually have data,	no
11725	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mmm, yeah.	no
11726	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	but, um, I think our outside sponsor	no
11727	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
11728	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	if we have a long-term need to do lots and lots of transcribing. I think we had a very quick need to get something out	no
11729	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	and we'd like to be able to do	no
11730	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	But as far a- you know, uh, with - with any luck we'll be able to wind down the larger project.	no
11731	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Oh.	no
11732	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	What our	no
11733	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
11734	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Right.	no
11735	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
11736	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And - and do what we can later	no
11737	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
11738	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Right.	no
11739	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	if it were	no
11740	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	you know, this week,	no
11741	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Uh-huh.	no
11742	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	it would be nice for them to be able to specify	no
11743	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	when - you know, the start points and end points of overlaps.	no
11744	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
11745	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	That's great.	no
11746	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And, um, so my -	no
11747	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	That's great. Yeah.	no
11748	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	forward Morgan Brian's	no
11749	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	e- to the local list. You saw that?	no
11750	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Meeting Recorder.	no
11751	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Oh, you did? O_K. So you probably did get that.	no
11752	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	So Brian	no
11753	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	that they are	no
11754	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I mean, basically it's - it's all the difference in the world. I mean, basically he's - he's	no
11755	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	and -	no
11756	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
11757	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Oh, that's - this is a new development.	no
11758	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	So - so - so this is - so i- it'll happen.	no
11759	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Super. Super. O_K. Great.	no
11760	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. I mean, basically it's just saying that one of our - one of our best people is on it,	no
11761	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	you know, who just doesn't happen to be	no
11762	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
11763	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	But about the need for transcription, I mean, don't we - didn't we previously	no
11764	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
11765	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	decide that the	no
11766	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yes. That's true.	no
11767	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
11768	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	So, I think having a good	no
11769	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. S- O_K. That's - that's a good point.	no
11770	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah, and Dave Gelbart did volunteer, and since he's not here, I'll repeat it -	no
11771	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Good.	no
11772	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	to at least modify Transcriber, which, if we don't have something else that works, I think that's a pretty good way of going.	no
11773	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mmm.	no
11774	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
11775	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And we discussed on some methods to do it. My approach originally, and I've already hacked on it a little	no
11776	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	it was too slow because I was trying to display all the waveforms. But he pointed out that you don't really	no
11777	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
11778	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
11779	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Hmm.	no
11780	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	That if you just display the	no
11781	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	and then have a user interface for editing the different channels, that's perfectly sufficient.	no
11782	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah,	no
11783	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	different	no
11784	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	No. They can only display one, but they can listen to different ones.	no
11785	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Oh, yes,	no
11786	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Well,	no
11787	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	those	no
11788	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	um, choice	no
11789	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	from moment to moment.	no
11790	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	But only to	no
11791	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
11792	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	The waveform you're looking at doesn't change.	no
11793	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
11794	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	That's true. Yeah, but	no
11795	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
11796	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	you know, they're focused on the ear anyway. And then - and then	no
11797	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Right.	no
11798	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Hmm.	no
11799	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	preserve the	no
11800	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Right.	no
11801	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	you know, a single channel, separable, uh, cleanly,	no
11802	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
11803	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	easily separable, uh, transcript tied to a single channel, uh, audio.	no
11804	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
11805	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K.	no
11806	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K. Well, holidays may have interrupted things, cuz in - in - in - They	no
11807	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	seem to want to	no
11808	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Oh! This was from before	no
11809	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Right. Because they're - they're presumably going to start recording next month.	no
11810	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K. O_K.	no
11811	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Oh, we should definitely get	no
11812	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	So.	no
11813	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	agree upon a	no
11814	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Though I don't remember	no
11815	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Um. Yeah, I don't think I	no
11816	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Oh, O_K.	no
11817	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	That's right.	no
11818	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	if, uh - that - that, uh, as the point person on it. But -	no
11819	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah, I think that's right. Just, uh -	no
11820	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	So, yeah. Maybe I'll, uh,	no
11821	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	ping them a little bit about it to	no
11822	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K.	no
11823	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I'm keeping the conventions	no
11824	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	get that straight.	no
11825	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. So is it - cuz with any luck there'll actually be a - a - there'll be collections at Columbia, collections at - at U_W -	no
11826	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I mean Dan - Dan is very interested in doing some other things,	no
11827	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Right.	no
11828	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. Yeah.	no
11829	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Well, I think it's important both	no
11830	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	and collections at NIST. So -	no
11831	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	for the notation and the machine representation to be the same.	no
11832	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
11833	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	So.	no
11834	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	N- there was also this,	no
11835	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yep.	no
11836	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
11837	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
11838	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I don't know if, uh,	no
11839	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	uh, we wanna, uh - and Dan Gel- and Dave Gelbart is interested in	no
11840	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	a - a - as a basis for the separation.	no
11841	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Cross-	no
11842	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah, cross-correlation. I had mentioned this a couple times before, the c- the commercial devices that do, uh,	no
11843	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Cross-	no
11844	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Uh-huh.	no
11845	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	uh, voice, uh - you know, active miking,	no
11846	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	basically	no
11847	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	some function of	no
11848	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
11849	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K.	no
11850	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
11851	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	by doing that, you know, rather than setting any, uh, absolute threshold, you actually can do pretty good, uh, selection of who - who's talking.	no
11852	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K.	no
11853	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And those - those systems work very	no
11854	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	panel discussions and so forth with sound reinforcement differing in - in sort of, uh -	no
11855	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Uh-huh.	no
11856	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Boy, the guy I knew who built	no
11857	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	twenty years ago, so they're -	no
11858	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Hmm.	no
11859	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Fantastic.	no
11860	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	So.	no
11861	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Cuz there is one thing that we don't have right now and that is the automatic, um,	no
11862	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
11863	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	That - that, you know, that would g- help in terms of encoding of	no
11864	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	uh, disentangling to do	no
11865	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. So I think, you know, basically you can	no
11866	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	But.	no
11867	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	look at some - p- you have to play around a little bit, uh, to figure out what the right statistic is, but you compare each microphone to some statistic based on the -	no
11868	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
11869	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
11870	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	on the overall -	no
11871	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
11872	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
11873	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K.	no
11874	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Uh, and we also have these - we have the advantage of having	no
11875	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah, although the - the -	no
11876	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	using the close-talking I think would be much better. Wouldn't it?	no
11877	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Um.	no
11878	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
11879	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I - I don't know. I just - it'd be -	no
11880	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
11881	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	If I was actually working on it, I'd sit there and - and play around with it, and - and get a feeling for it. I mean, the - the - the, uh - But,	no
11882	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	uh, you certainly wanna use the close-talking, as a - at	no
11883	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Right.	no
11884	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I don't know if the other would - would add some other helpful dimension or not.	no
11885	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
11886	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
11887	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K. What - what are the different, uh, classes to - to code, uh, the - the overlap, you will use?	no
11888	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Um, to code d- so	no
11889	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	What you - you - Yeah.	no
11890	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Um, so	no
11891	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And, um -	no
11892	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
11893	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Look like, uh, you t- you explaining in the blackboard? The - ? Yeah? Yeah.	no
11894	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yes, exactly. That hasn't changed. So it	no
11895	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	where the first one is	no
11896	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	below that there're	no
11897	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
11898	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	uh, simply	no
11899	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	completing someone else's thought,	no
11900	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Right.	no
11901	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And I	no
11902	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	that if we do a forced alignment with the close-talking mike, that will be enough to recover	no
11903	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
11904	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	at least	no
11905	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	the time information of when the overlap occurred.	no
11906	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm. Well,	no
11907	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
11908	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	We hope.	no
11909	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. Who knows?	no
11910	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	That'd be - that'd be	no
11911	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I - I - I - I've -	no
11912	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	So who's gonna do that? Who's gonna do forced alignment?	no
11913	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Well, u- uh, I_B_M was	no
11914	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Oh, O_K.	no
11915	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Oh.	no
11916	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	and I	no
11917	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K.	no
11918	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Uh-huh.	no
11919	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K. I'll do that.	no
11920	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
11921	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
11922	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
11923	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	one of my transcribers t-	no
11924	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
11925	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	um, by - well, she said tomorrow	no
11926	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
11927	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	maybe the day after just to be s- on the safe side.	no
11928	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I could send Brian the,	no
11929	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	the	no
11930	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	er, uh, I could send him that	no
11931	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	on the way we're encoding overlaps now.	no
11932	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Well, just talk to him about it.	no
11933	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yep.	no
11934	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Good.	no
11935	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I mean, you know, basically he's - he just studies, he's a colleague, a friend, and,	no
11936	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah! Super. Super.	no
11937	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	uh, they - and - and, you know, the - the organization always	no
11938	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah, yeah.	no
11939	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Right.	no
11940	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Is he on the mailing list?	no
11941	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	The Meeting Recorder mailing li- ? We should add him.	no
11942	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
11943	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. I - I - I don't	no
11944	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Did something	no
11945	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Add him.	no
11946	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	It - it oc- I - h- it's -	no
11947	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah, something happened. I don't know what. But he's on it now.	no
11948	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	He asked for more work.	no
11949	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Huh.	no
11950	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Right.	no
11951	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	So, uh,	no
11952	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	where are we? Maybe, uh, uh,	no
11953	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	brief -	no
11954	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Well, let's - why don't we talk about microphone issues? That was - that was a -	no
11955	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. That'd be	no
11956	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Um,	no
11957	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	so	no
11958	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	for the head m- head-worn ones cuz they're so uncomfortable.	no
11959	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	But I think I need someone who knows more about mikes than	no
11960	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	seemed like it would fit the connector,	no
11961	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	which seems	no
11962	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Does anyone, like,	no
11963	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	know stores or	no
11964	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	know about mikes who - who would know the right questions to ask?	no
11965	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Oh, I	no
11966	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
11967	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Uh, so maybe we c- we can take a look at that.	no
11968	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	You couldn't - you couldn't find the right connector to go into	no
11969	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yep.	no
11970	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Huh!	no
11971	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	When I	no
11972	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	as having that type of connector. But my	no
11973	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	is that Sony maybe uses a different	no
11974	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And - and so -	no
11975	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
11976	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Well, let's look at it together and -	no
11977	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	it seems - it seems really unlikely to me that there's only one.	no
11978	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And there's no	no
11979	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Seems like there'd be a - O_K.	no
11980	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
11981	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	As I said, who knows?	no
11982	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
11983	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Um,	no
11984	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I have it downstairs. I don't remember off the top of my head.	no
11985	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. O_K.	no
11986	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. We - we can try and look at that together.	no
11987	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And then, uh -	no
11988	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	just in terms of	no
11989	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I mean, I had thought about this before. I mean, when - when - when you use a product like DragonDictate, they have a very extensive description about how to wear the microphone and so on.	no
11990	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	But	no
11991	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	in a	no
11992	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	But -	no
11993	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Well, I think that that's - that's a good	no
11994	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	back-off position. That's what I was saying	no
11995	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	recordings that are	no
11996	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	uh, the naturalness of the situation	no
11997	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	to try to have people	no
11998	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
11999	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	um, the	no
12000	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Oh. That's true.	no
12001	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	you know, in the target applications that we're talking about, people aren't gonna be wearing head-mounted mikes anyway. So this is just for u- these head-mounted mikes are just for use with research.	no
12002	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12003	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12004	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
12005	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And, uh, it's gonna make -	no
12006	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12007	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	You know, if - if An- Andreas plays around with language modeling, he's	no
12008	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Right.	no
12009	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	But it does	no
12010	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12011	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	It's interesting, uh,	no
12012	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I talked to some I_B_M guys, uh, last January, I think, I was there. And -	no
12013	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	so people who were working on the - on their ViaVoice	no
12014	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12015	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	dictation product.	no
12016	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And they said,	no
12017	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	uh, the breathing is really a - a terrible problem	no
12018	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	to - to not recognize breathing as speech.	no
12019	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Wow.	no
12020	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	So, anything to reduce breathing is -	no
12021	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12022	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Well, that's the -	no
12023	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	is - is a good thing.	no
12024	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	It seemed to me when I was using Dragon	no
12025	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
12026	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	that it was really microphone placement helped an - in, uh - an enormous amount. So you want it	no
12027	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Right.	no
12028	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	enough to the side so that when you exhale through your	no
12029	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
12030	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And then, uh -	no
12031	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And then just	no
12032	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12033	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12034	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	seems to be about the right way to do it.	no
12035	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	um,	no
12036	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	a prominent laboratory's, uh, uh, speech recognizer about,	no
12037	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	This was,	no
12038	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	twelve years ago or something.	no
12039	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And, um,	no
12040	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	they were - they were	no
12041	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	they had Markov models for br- breathing	no
12042	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Uh -	no
12043	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12044	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	That's interesting.	no
12045	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Well, what	no
12046	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	to maybe use the	no
12047	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	and - and then see if when they're breathing it's	no
12048	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I mean, when - when it's	no
12049	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Can you see the breathing? Cuz I -	no
12050	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12051	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And so, you know, I've - I've sat here and	no
12052	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	sometimes the breathing,	no
12053	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I could	no
12054	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I don't want to make people self-conscious. Stop breathing!	no
12055	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	It - it's going to be imperfect. You're not gonna get it perfect.	no
12056	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12057	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	uh, uh, a- away from being just directly in front of the middle	no
12058	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12059	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Good.	no
12060	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	but not too far away.	no
12061	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And then, you know, I think there's not much - Because you can't al- you know, interfere w-	no
12062	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	you can't fine tune the meeting	no
12063	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Right.	no
12064	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12065	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	and the quality goes, you know, uh, dramatically	no
12066	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yep.	no
12067	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	up, then it might be worth	no
12068	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And then also - the position of the mike also. If it's more directly, you'll get better volume.	no
12069	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12070	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	So - so, like, yours is pretty far	no
12071	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12072	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12073	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mmm, yeah.	no
12074	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
12075	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I don't know why	no
12076	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Well, I mean, you - Yeah, of course. You're - you're also -	no
12077	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	uh, your	no
12078	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I've been eating a lot.	no
12079	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I- it makes their - their job extremely easy. Yeah.	no
12080	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And then there's mass.	no
12081	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Anyway.	no
12082	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
12083	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	About what?	no
12084	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	About the transcribers or anything or - ? I don't know.	yes
12085	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	About the transcribers or anything or - ? I don't know.	no
12086	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	But, uh, just to - to, um -	no
12087	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	One more remark, uh, concerning the S_R_I recognizer. Um.	no
12088	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	It is useful to transcribe and then ultimately train models for things like breath, and also laughter is very, very frequent and important to -	no
12089	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
12090	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	to model.	no
12091	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	So,	no
12092	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	So,	no
12093	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	if you can in your transcripts mark -	no
12094	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	mark	no
12095	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	mark very audible breaths and laughter especially, um - O_K.	no
12096	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mmm.	no
12097	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
12098	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	"It - they - and then in curly brackets they say ""laughter"". Now they're -"	no
12099	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Oh, great.	no
12100	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	they're not being	no
12101	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
12102	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	when sometimes s- someone will start laughing when they're in the middle of a sentence.	no
12103	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
12104	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And - and then the other one is when they finish the sentence and then they laugh.	no
12105	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	So, um, I - I did s- I did some double checking to look through - I mean,	no
12106	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	hhh	no
12107	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	e- extra complications, like time tags indicating the beginning and ending of -	no
12108	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	of the	no
12109	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	It's not so - I don't think it's, um -	no
12110	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	As - as long as there	no
12111	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12112	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Good.	no
12113	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Oh!	no
12114	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K.	no
12115	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I think that's	no
12116	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Against - they could do forced alignment.	no
12117	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	actually the recognition of laughter once you kn- um -	no
12118	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12119	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	you know, is pretty	no
12120	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Oh, I didn't know that.	no
12121	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	you know, a t- a	no
12122	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	that indicates that there	no
12123	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K.	no
12124	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	that would probably be, uh, sufficient to train models.	no
12125	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	That would be a	no
12126	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And let me ask y- and I gotta ask you one thing about that. So, um,	no
12127	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12128	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Hmm.	no
12129	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	if they laugh between two words, you - you'd get it	no
12130	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
12131	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	in between the two words. But if they laugh across three or	no
12132	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Right.	no
12133	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12134	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Well, the thing that you - is hard to deal with is whe-	no
12135	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	when they speak while laughing.	no
12136	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Um, and that's, uh - I don't	no
12137	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	think that we can do very well with that. So -	no
12138	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Right.	no
12139	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	But, um, that's not as frequent as just laughing between	no
12140	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K.	no
12141	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	speaking, so -	no
12142	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	So are - do you treat breath and laughter as	no
12143	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Huh.	no
12144	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I - I think it's frequent in - in the meeting.	no
12145	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	um, we use special words.	no
12146	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	There was a -	no
12147	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	there's actually a word for -	no
12148	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	uh, it's not just breathing but all kinds of mouth - uh, mouth - mouth stuff.	no
12149	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm. Mouth stuff?	no
12150	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And then laughter is a - is a special word.	no
12151	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	How would we do that with the hybrid system?	no
12152	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Same thing.	no
12153	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Same thing?	no
12154	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	So train a phone	no
12155	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12156	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. You ha- Oh. And each of these words has a dedicated phone.	no
12157	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	No -	no
12158	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Oh, it does?	no
12159	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	So the - so the - the mouth noise, uh,	no
12160	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	um, that is for	no
12161	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Right. So in the hybrid system we could train the net with	no
12162	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12163	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	a laughter phone and a breath sound phone.	no
12164	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. Yeah.	no
12165	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I mean, it's - it's - it's always the same thing. Right? I mean, you could - you could say well, let -	no
12166	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
12167	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	we	no
12168	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	sub-units in the - the three states, uh - different states. And then you would have three -	no
12169	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12170	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And the - the pronun- the pronunciations - the pronunciations are l- are somewhat non-standard. They actually are -	no
12171	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Do whatever you want.	no
12172	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah, yeah.	no
12173	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	No.	no
12174	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	uh, it's just a single,	no
12175	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	s- uh, you know, a single	no
12176	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	To	no
12177	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	r- can go on forever.	no
12178	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And how do you handle it in the language model?	no
12179	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	It's just a - it's just a word. We train it like any other word. Yeah.	no
12180	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	It's just a word in the language model. Cool.	no
12181	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	We also tried,	no
12182	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	um, absorbing these - uh, both laughter and -	no
12183	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	and actually also noise, and, um -	no
12184	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Sorry to interrupt.	no
12185	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12186	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Is -	no
12187	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K.	no
12188	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
12189	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	that matches the stuff between words.	no
12190	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And, um,	no
12191	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	it didn't work as well. So.	no
12192	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Huh. O_K.	no
12193	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
12194	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Can you hand me your digit form?	no
12195	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Sorry.	no
12196	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I just wanna mark that you did	no
12197	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K.	no
12198	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Good.	no
12199	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	f- f- laughing - I think it may be an individual thing. Some people are more prone to laughing when they're speaking.	no
12200	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12201	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. I think -	no
12202	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I was noticing that with Dan in the one that we, uh -	no
12203	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	But I can't -	no
12204	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12205	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	we hand tran- hand-segmented, that - th- he has these little	no
12206	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. O_K.	no
12207	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	one thing that c- that we're	no
12208	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	in these recordings. We have	no
12209	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12210	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12211	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Uh, yeah. And -	no
12212	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Uh -	yes
12213	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. Why don- why don't we just - since we're on this vein, why don't we just continue with, uh, what you were gonna say about the transcriptions and - ?	no
12214	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Um, um, the - I - I'm really very for- I'm	no
12215	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	are, um, um,	no
12216	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	No, they're super. They're - the- they - very quick.	no
12217	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K. Turn the mikes off and let's talk.	no
12218	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah, I know. I am - I'm serious.	no
12219	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	So I, um,	no
12220	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	e- you know, I - I brought	no
12221	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	raise questions - you know, i- i- the- they think about different things and they think of different -	no
12222	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	That's a good idea.	no
12223	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I trained them to, uh,	no
12224	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	f- on about a minute or two of the one that was already	no
12225	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	You know, I can - I can use that	no
12226	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	But the main thing was to get them	no
12227	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	you know, the idea of the - th- th- the size of the unit versus how long it takes to play it back so these - th- sort of calibration issues.	no
12228	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Good.	no
12229	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Uh-huh.	no
12230	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Oh, no. Is that good or bad?	no
12231	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	"Well, they- they're very perce- they'll - So one of them said ""well, you know, he really said """	no
12232	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. Yeah.	no
12233	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	so what	no
12234	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12235	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12236	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I	no
12237	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K.	no
12238	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	But I told them if - if there's an obvious	no
12239	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yes.	no
12240	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	uh, like I said in one thing, and I gave my - my example,	no
12241	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	"Didn't bother - I knew it when I said it. I remember s- thinking ""oh, that's not"	no
12242	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	"correctly pronounced""."	no
12243	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	You'll self-repair.	no
12244	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12245	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	But I have a convention that if it's obviously a noncanonical pronunciation - a speech error with - you know, wi-	no
12246	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	within the realm of resolution that you can tell in this native English -	no
12247	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	"American English speaker, you know that I didn't mean to say ""microfon."""	no
12248	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	"Then you'd put a little tick at the beginning of the word, and that just signals that, um, this is not standard, and then in curly brackets ""pron"	no
12249	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12250	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And, um, and other than	no
12251	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	"you know, the """	no
12252	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And - and s- several of them are trained in I_P_A.	no
12253	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
12254	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Hmm. Where were they when	no
12255	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Well, you know, it might be something we'd wanna do with some, uh, s- small subset	no
12256	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	We certainly wouldn't wanna do it with everything.	no
12257	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And I'm also thinking these people are a	no
12258	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Uh-huh.	no
12259	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	think they know that the data p- source is	no
12260	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And -	no
12261	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	uh, use them for	no
12262	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	a more detailed analysis of the	no
12263	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Right?	no
12264	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	that we were talking about. We	no
12265	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Right? One for each participant.	no
12266	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	So they could by	no
12267	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Well, that's one way to do it. But I've been saying the other thing is	no
12268	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12269	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12270	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm, that's right. And with the right in- interface -	no
12271	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Given that y- and - and do - so instead of doing phonetic, uh, uh, transcription for the whole thing, which	no
12272	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	we know from the - Steve's experience with the Switchboard transcription is, you know,	no
12273	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	and you know, it took them I don't know how many months to do - to get four	no
12274	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	that hasn't been	no
12275	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Uh, we can	no

12277	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12278	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
12279	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	But anyway, I'm - I'm open to c- our consideration.	no
12280	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I - I don't wanna say that by fiat. I'm open to every consideration of	no
12281	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Hmm.	no
12282	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12283	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	what are some other kinds of detailed analysis that would be most useful. And, uh, uh,	no
12284	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
12285	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Hmm.	no
12286	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I - I - I think	no
12287	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Oh, wonderful.	no
12288	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	It's a - we have - we have - due to	no
12289	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	next year we may have - have much less. So I don't wanna	no
12290	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Is - you mean two thousand one?	no
12291	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Calendar year or - ?	no
12292	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Uh, I mean, calendar year two thousand one.	no
12293	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K.	no
12294	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. So it's - uh, it's - we don't wanna	no
12295	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Full-time. Yeah.	no
12296	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm. Yeah.	no
12297	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	the - the funding that we've gotten is sort of a big chunk for this	no
12298	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	having	no
12299	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Wonderful.	no
12300	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And then school will start in - in the sixt- on the sixteenth. Some of them will have to cut back their hours at that point.	no
12301	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12302	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12303	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Are they working full-time now, or - ?	no
12304	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Some of them	no
12305	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Wow.	no
12306	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Well, why do- I wouldn't say forty-hour weeks. No. But what I mean is -	no
12307	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Oh, I shouldn't say it that way because	no
12308	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I th- I - I would say they're probably	no
12309	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Hmm.	no
12310	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	But	no
12311	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	No. You're right. It's - i- it would be too taxing. But, um, they're putting	no
12312	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12313	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And - and I checked	no
12314	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I -	no
12315	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I remember when we were transcribing BeRP, uh, uh,	no
12316	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I think it would be -	no
12317	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	uh, Ron Kay, uh, volunteered to - to do some of that. And, he was - the first - first stuff he did was transcribing Chuck.	no
12318	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	"And he's saying ""You - you know, I always thought Chuck spoke really"	no
12319	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. Yeah.	no
12320	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	great choices for doing coding of that type if we wanted, or	no
12321	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	We'd have to mark	no
12322	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
12323	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	whatever. So, um.	no
12324	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
12325	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12326	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I think it would also be interesting to have, uh,	no
12327	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	a couple of the meetings have more than one transcriber do,	no
12328	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
12329	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	cuz I'm curious about inter-annotator agreement.	no
12330	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12331	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K.	no
12332	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. Th- that'd be -	no
12333	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12334	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I think that's a - a good idea. You know, there's also, the e- In	no
12335	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I think A- An- Andreas was	no
12336	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	we haven't yet	no
12337	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	you know,	no
12338	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	great headphones, m- um -	no
12339	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Something like that.	no
12340	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Maybe an	no
12341	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	clear things up.	no
12342	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	of the verbal part	no
12343	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Well, tha- that's - that's debatable. Right? I mean, so the - so the argument is that if your statistical system is good	no
12344	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K.	no
12345	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	it will in fact, uh, clean things up. Right? So it- it's got its own objective criterion.	no
12346	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K.	no
12347	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12348	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And, uh, so in	no
12349	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I mean, to give an example of, um, something we used to do, uh, at one point, uh, back - back when Chuck was here in early times, is we would take,	no
12350	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	da- take a	no
12351	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	and, uh, if there was five phones in a word,	no
12352	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	uh, into five	no
12353	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Wrong.	no
12354	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Right? I mean, th- the timing is off	no
12355	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12356	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
12357	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K.	no
12358	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	But it's O_	no
12359	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	You start	no
12360	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Oh, excellent. O_K.	no
12361	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	So - so I think using a - a good	no
12362	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	But, uh, you know, they	no
12363	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	If you have a good alignment, it helps the, uh, th- the human in - in taking less time to	no
12364	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K.	no
12365	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Excellent.	no
12366	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	very possibly a different, uh, topic. But,	no
12367	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	higher-order organization within meetings. So like in a -	no
12368	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	you know, the topics that are covered during a meeting with reference to the other, uh,	no
12369	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
12370	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	then, um,	no
12371	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	um -	no
12372	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	e- I mean, I - I - I did sort of a -	no
12373	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	a rough	no
12374	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
12375	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	things on the, uh,	no
12376	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
12377	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And I don't know if, um -	no
12378	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
12379	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I mean, i- I - I don't know what	no
12380	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	uh,	no
12381	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	level of detail would be most	no
12382	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
12383	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	But this issue of the	no
12384	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	in an outline form.	no
12385	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K.	no
12386	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Um -	no
12387	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I think it just -	no
12388	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	whoever is interested can	no
12389	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I mean, so if someone wants to use that data -	no
12390	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K.	no
12391	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	We're running a little short here. We, uh, uh, cou- trying to -	no
12392	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	That's fine.	no
12393	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I'm finished.	yes
12394	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I'm finished.	no
12395	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	eh, was - p- Well, you know, the thing I'm concerned about is we wanted to do these digits and - and I haven't heard, uh, from Jose yet. So -	no
12396	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Oh, yeah.	no
12397	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Oh, yes. Mm-hmm.	no
12398	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K. What do you want?	no
12399	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Uh -	no
12400	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	We could	no
12401	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Uh -	no
12402	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I - I -	no
12403	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K.	no
12404	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Did you	no
12405	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. It's - it's prepared.	no
12406	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. Uh, how long a - ?	no
12407	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Oh, k- Sorry.	no
12408	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I - I think it's - it's fast, because, uh,	no
12409	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I have the results, eh, of the study of different energy without the	no
12410	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Eh, um, eh,	no
12411	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12412	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Um, I -	no
12413	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	th- i-	no
12414	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	the other, uh - the - the last w- uh, meeting -	no
12415	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	eh, I don't know if you	no
12416	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	with - with the parameter - with the representations of parameter,	no
12417	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yes.	no
12418	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	because the - the valleys and the peaks in the signal, eh, look like, eh, it doesn't follow to the - to the energy in the signal.	no
12419	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Right.	no
12420	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And it was a problem, uh, with the scale.	no
12421	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	With what?	no
12422	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Scale.	no
12423	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Scale.	no
12424	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Eh, and I - I change the scale and we can see the - the variance.	no
12425	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	But the bottom line is it's still not, uh, separating out very well. Right? O_K.	no
12426	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. Yeah. The distribution - the distribution is - is similar.	no
12427	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	So that's -	no
12428	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	that's - that's enough then. O_K.	no
12429	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12430	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	No, I mean, that there's no point in going through all of that if that's the bottom line, really. So, I - I think we have to start -	no
12431	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. Yeah.	no
12432	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
12433	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Uh, I mean, there- there's	no
12434	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mmm, yeah.	no
12435	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	um, it looks like,	no
12436	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	at	no
12437	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12438	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Um, I - I'm - I'm	no
12439	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12440	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12441	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	but you don't want to keep, uh - keep knocking at it if it's - if you're not getting any - any	no
12442	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	But, I mean, the other things that we talked about is, uh,	no
12443	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	pitch-related things and harmonicity-related things, so - which we thought also should be some kind of a reasonable indicator.	no
12444	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12445	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Um -	no
12446	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	But, uh,	no
12447	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	a completely	no
12448	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12449	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	which is to say, don't worry so much about the, uh, features.	no
12450	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12451	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	That is to say, use, you know, as - as you're doing with the speech, uh, nonspeech, use some very	no
12452	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12453	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And, uh, then, uh, look at it	no
12454	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12455	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	You know, have a - have a couple Markov models and -	no
12456	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12457	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12458	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	and, uh, try to indi- try to determine, you know, w- when is th- when are you	no
12459	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Hmm.	no
12460	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And let the, uh, uh, statistical system	no
12461	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I - I, um,	no
12462	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12463	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I	no
12464	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	But given the limitation in	no
12465	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12466	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	and given the fact that Javier's system already	no
12467	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12468	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	uh, but, uh,	no
12469	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	its main limitation is that, again, it's only looking at silences which	no
12470	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12471	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12472	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	maybe	no
12473	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12474	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	So.	no
12475	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
12476	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I - I - I think that, eh, the possibility, eh, can be that, eh,	no
12477	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
12478	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	not only, eh, nonspeech and speech, but, eh, in - in - in the speech class,	no
12479	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
12480	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	dividing, eh, speech, eh, of - from a speaker and overlapping,	no
12481	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	to try - to - to do, eh, eh, a fast - a fast, eh,	no
12482	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	experiment to - to prove that, nnn, this fea- eh, general feature,	no
12483	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12484	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	eh, can solve the - the - the	no
12485	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Maybe. Yeah.	no
12486	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	nnn, how far is -	no
12487	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And, I - I have prepared the - the pitch tracker now.	no
12488	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
12489	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And I hope the - the next week I will have, eh, some results and we - we will show - we will see, eh, the - the parameter - the pitch,	no
12490	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I see.	no
12491	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	eh, tracking in - with the program.	no
12492	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	speech segmenter?	no
12493	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	No.	no
12494	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Oh. Maybe m- you could, you kn-	no
12495	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	No.	no
12496	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	No.	no
12497	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. Yeah.	no
12498	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. Sure.	no
12499	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Cuz again the idea is there - the limitation there again was that he was - he was only using it to look at silence as a - as a - as a - as a p- putative	no
12500	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I -	no
12501	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12502	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	split point between speakers. But if you included, uh,	no
12503	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K.	no
12504	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	broadened classes then	no
12505	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mmm, yeah.	no
12506	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah, but I'm not too sure if - if we can	no
12507	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Uh -	no
12508	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	overlap with - with the s-	no
12509	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
12510	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I think with -	no
12511	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Ah.	no
12512	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	it's only speech or it's - it's - it's nonspeech. So.	no
12513	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	That's right. But I think Javier's -	no
12514	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12515	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I think Javier's	no
12516	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12517	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K.	no
12518	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	But, uh -	no
12519	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Well, it's - sort of has a	no
12520	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mmm, yeah.	no
12521	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	it's just - it's just a - isn't it just a Gaussian	no
12522	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	for each - ?	no
12523	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12524	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12525	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Hmm.	no
12526	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
12527	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12528	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And then	no
12529	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Oh, it doesn't have - it doesn't have any temporal, uh - ? I thought it -	no
12530	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Maybe I'm misremembering, but I did	no
12531	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12532	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I gues-	no
12533	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I guess	no
12534	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Uh. It's been a while.	no
12535	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Javier -	no
12536	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Uh.	no
12537	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	You mean Ja- eh, eh, Javier program? No, Javier di- doesn't worked with, uh, a Markov -	no
12538	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
12539	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah, I didn't think so.	no
12540	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Oh,	no
12541	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	He on- only train -	no
12542	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yep.	no
12543	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. It was only Gaussian.	no
12544	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	This is the idea.	no
12545	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And so I - I think it would work	no
12546	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	It's just, uh,	no
12547	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	that i- it - he has the two-pass issue that -	no
12548	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	What he	no
12549	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	um, a	no
12550	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And that's just a data	no
12551	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	so that you're not	no
12552	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K.	no
12553	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And so those are the	no
12554	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12555	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. O_K.	no
12556	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And right now he's doing that with	no
12557	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	with the Meeting Recorder.	no
12558	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12559	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	So if we used	no
12560	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. Sure.	no
12561	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. Yeah, O_K.	no
12562	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	As long as the len- as long the segments are long enough.	no
12563	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12564	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	That's the other problem.	no
12565	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	So -	no
12566	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12567	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
12568	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	The	no
12569	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	is - Couldn't - I mean, it's - So you have two categories	no
12570	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	and you have Markov models for	no
12571	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12572	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Couldn't you have a third category?	no
12573	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	So you have, uh - you have,	no
12574	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	uh, nonspeech, single-person speech, and multiple-person speech?	no
12575	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Don't you have, like those - those several different	no
12576	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Right? And then you have a Markov model for each?	no
12577	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Um -	no
12578	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I'm not sure. I - I thought about, uh, adding, uh, uh, another class too. But it's not too easy, I think, the -	no
12579	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	the transition between the different class, to model them in - in the system	no
12580	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I see.	no
12581	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	in principle.	no
12582	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah, I mean, I -	no
12583	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	This is all pretty	no
12584	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12585	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12586	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	we should at least look at the	no
12587	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12588	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12589	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	It seems like if two people - two or more people talk at once, it should get	no
12590	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12591	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	uh, and, uh, uh, there should be some discontinuity in pitch contours,	no
12592	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I had the impression.	no
12593	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12594	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	and, uh, there should overall be a, um, smaller proportion of the total energy that is explained by any particular harmonic	no
12595	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12596	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12597	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Right.	no
12598	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	So those are all things that	no
12599	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
12600	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12601	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	um, uh, Jose has - has been -	no
12602	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	By the way, I was	no
12603	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	by your	no
12604	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12605	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	uh, the - has - has, uh,	no
12606	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	been exploring, uh, e-	no
12607	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	um,	no
12608	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	as with a	no
12609	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12610	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	is it, uh,	no
12611	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	absolute	no
12612	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	it should be with - compared to	no
12613	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12614	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	th- he's been playing around with a lot of these different things and - and so far at least has not come up with	no
12615	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Hmm.	no
12616	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12617	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I - I	no
12618	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12619	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	to - to	no
12620	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12621	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I'm - I'm	no
12622	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12623	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12624	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12625	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Th-	no
12626	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	uh, but in addition there's an expansion of what	no
12627	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	One.	no
12628	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12629	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	even if the features that you give it are maybe not	no
12630	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12631	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	or cepstrum or something, um -	no
12632	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Eee	no
12633	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	But, eh, what did you think about the possibility of	no
12634	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Eh, I mean, the, uh - the, uh - the	no
12635	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	eh, using the - the mark, eh, by hand, eh, eh, to distinguish be- mmm, to train overlapping zone and speech zone. I mean,	no
12636	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	eh,	no
12637	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	th- eh, to prove that, mmm, if s- we suppose that, eh, the - the first step -	no
12638	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I mean, the - the classifier	no
12639	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	what were the classifier from Javier or classifier from Thilo?	no
12640	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	W- What happen with the second step?	no
12641	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I - I mean, what - what happen with the, eh - the, uh, clu- the, uh - the clu- the clustering process?	no
12642	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
12643	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Using the - the Gaussian. Yeah.	no
12644	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	You mean Javier's?	no
12645	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	What do you mean?	no
12646	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I - I mean, that is - is enough - is enough, eh, to work well, eh, to, eh, separate or to distinguish, eh, between overlapping zone and, eh, speaker zone?	no
12647	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I -	no
12648	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	and the second step doesn't work	no
12649	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. I had	no
12650	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	So what I d- I d- I took a	no
12651	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Nnn, yeah.	no
12652	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	ten times the amount of numbers at	no
12653	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12654	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Oh.	no
12655	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	and it did pick	no
12656	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. But is - is - if -	no
12657	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	pretty good boundaries. But this was just very anecdotal sort of thing.	no
12658	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	But it's possible with my segmentation by	no
12659	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Right. So if we - if we	no
12660	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	fed the hand-segmentation to Javier's	no
12661	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	The -	no
12662	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	N- n- Yeah. No.	no
12663	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	and it	no
12664	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. I think that's probably worthwhile doing.	no
12665	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Uh-huh.	no
12666	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Uh, we can prove that the -	no
12667	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Whether it'll work or not.	no
12668	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	this kind o-	no
12669	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
12670	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	emph-	no
12671	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yep.	no
12672	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Y- do you know where his software is? Have you used it at all?	no

12825	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
12826	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
12827	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K, agenda item one, introduce	no
12828	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	We went -	no
12829	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well, I had a - just a	no
12830	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	the	no
12831	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K, so let's - let's - So let's just do agenda	no
12832	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I mean, that was -	no
12833	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Uh,	no
12834	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well, you - you, um, already know about the meeting	no
12835	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	this is appropriate for this.	no
12836	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	No, no, that's O_K. We can - so - we can ta- so n- NIST is - NIST folks are coming by next week and so we can talk about that.	no
12837	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K.	no
12838	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
12839	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Uh, uh, John Fiscus and, uh, I think George Doddington will be	no
12840	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
12841	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	around as well.	no
12842	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Sure. Mm-hmm.	no
12843	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Um,	no
12844	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	An- anything else, uh,	no
12845	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	strike anybody?	no
12846	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Uh, we started	no
12847	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Wha-	no
12848	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, the	no
12849	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Um,	no
12850	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, so, uh -	no
12851	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	What about, uh, is there anything new with the speech, nonspeech	no
12852	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	stuff?	no
12853	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K.	no
12854	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I had thought under	no
12855	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Oh, under the NIST meeting.	no
12856	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, under the NIST thing. Yeah.	no
12857	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K.	no
12858	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	u- u-	no
12859	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I guess the order we brought	no
12860	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	yes
12861	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	so, better quality close talking mikes. So the one issue was that the - the, uh, lapel mike, uh, isn't as good as you would like. And so,	no
12862	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, it - it'd be	no
12863	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Is that - is that basically the point?	no
12864	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Ri- um,	no
12865	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	yeah, the -	no
12866	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And actually in	no
12867	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	the close talking mikes are worn in such a way as to best capture the signal.	no
12868	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And the	no
12869	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh - or and even on	no
12870	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	it adds this extra, you know, vari-	no
12871	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right.	no
12872	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
12873	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So - And I	no
12874	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	that's useful for them to know in starting to collect	no
12875	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
12876	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well, so -	no
12877	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, well one thing I was gonna say was that, um,	no
12878	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	i-	no
12879	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	we could get more, uh, of the head mounted microphones even beyond the number of	no
12880	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I think whether it's radio or wire is probably second-order. And the main thing is having the microphone	no
12881	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
12882	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right, so, uh, actually the way Jose is wearing	no
12883	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
12884	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Is -	no
12885	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
12886	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I- it's	no
12887	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, th- that's good. So it's towards the corner of your mouth so that breath sounds don't get on it. And then just sort of	no
12888	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
12889	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
12890	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
12891	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	about, uh, a thumb or - a thumb and a half away from your - from your mouth.	no
12892	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
12893	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Uh, yeah.	no
12894	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right.	no
12895	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	How am I d-	no
12896	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	But we have more than one type of - I mean, for instance, you're -	no
12897	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
12898	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And	no
12899	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
12900	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right.	no
12901	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
12902	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Is fixed. Yeah.	no
12903	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
12904	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	But if we could actually standardize, you know, the - the microphones, uh, as much as possible that would be really helpful.	no
12905	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
12906	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
12907	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
12908	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well, I mean it doesn't hurt to have a few extra microphones around, so why don't we just go out and - and get an order of - of if this microphone seems O_K to people,	no
12909	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
12910	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, I'd just get a half dozen of these things.	no
12911	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well the onl- the only problem with that is right now, um, some of the Jimlets aren't working.	no
12912	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	The little - the boxes under the table.	no
12913	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
12914	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And so, w- Uh, I've only been able to find three jacks that are working.	no
12915	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
12916	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Can we get	no
12917	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So -	no
12918	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	No, but my	no
12919	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	But y- we could just record these signals separately and time align them with the start of the meeting.	no
12920	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	R- r- right -	no
12921	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I - I'm not sure I'm follow.	no
12922	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right now,	no
12923	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	we've got, uh, two microphones in the room,	no
12924	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	that are not quote-unquote	no
12925	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K, just	no
12926	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well, however many we can plug	no
12927	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K.	no
12928	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-yeah.	no
12929	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right.	no
12930	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	and so then that would be, you know,	no
12931	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right. O_K.	no
12932	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
12933	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So, uh - so we should go out to our full complement of whatever we can	no
12934	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	that it was done the	no
12935	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right.	no
12936	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	but uh,	no
12937	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	sounds - sounds fine.	no
12938	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Sounds like uniformity wins.	no
12939	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well, for short term research it's just - there's just so much	no
12940	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	effort that would have to be done up front n- uh, so - yeah, uniformity would be great.	no
12941	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well -	no
12942	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
12943	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Is it because -	no
12944	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	You - you're saying the - for dialogue purposes, so that means that the transcribers are having trouble with those	no
12945	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	mikes? Is that what you mean? Or - ?	no
12946	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well	no
12947	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yep.	no
12948	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Couple times.	no
12949	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	a	no
12950	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	ugh	no
12951	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And he's always - they always - they just rave about how wonderful Adam's -	no
12952	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right.	no
12953	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	What can I say.	no
12954	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And then,	no
12955	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So does the recognizer.	no
12956	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
12957	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	"Oh, really? Yeah, I'm not surprised. I mean, ""Baaah!"""	no
12958	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
12959	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, but I mean it's	no
12960	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Even if - if you're talking on someone	no
12961	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
12962	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	It's also like n- no breathing, no -	no
12963	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
12964	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	it's um, it's really -	no
12965	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
12966	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, it's an advantage when you don't breath.	no
12967	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, I think that the	no
12968	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right.	no
12969	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	When we're doing -	no
12970	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
12971	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So we might as	no
12972	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
12973	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right.	no
12974	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Now, this is	no
12975	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	locking the barn door after the horse was stolen. We do have thirty hours, of - of speech, which is done this way. But -	no
12976	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
12977	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	but, uh,	no
12978	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Great, great.	no
12979	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So I think just do a field trip at some point.	no
12980	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, probably - yeah, to the store we talked about and that -	no
12981	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yep.	no
12982	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And there was	no
12983	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yep.	no
12984	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So, as - as I said, we'll do a field trip and see if we can get all of the same mike that's more comfortable than - than these things, which I think are horrible.	no
12985	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K.	no
12986	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Good.	no
12987	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Great, thank you very much.	no
12988	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Especially for people with big heads.	no
12989	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And, you know, we're	no
12990	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K.	no
12991	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
12992	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K.	no
12993	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
12994	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Uh,	no
12995	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K, second item was the, uh,	no
12996	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	NIST visit, and what's going on there.	yes
12997	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	NIST visit, and what's going on there.	no
12998	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
12999	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K, so, um, uh,	no
13000	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Jonathan Fiscus is coming on the second of February and I've spoken with, uh,	no
13001	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	he expressed an interest in seeing the room and in, um, seeing a demonstration of the modified multitrans, which I'll mention in a second,	no
13002	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	and also, um, he was interested in the pre-segmentation and then he's also	no
13003	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
13004	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And, um - So, um, it seems to me in terms of like, um,	no
13005	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	i- i- it wou-	no
13006	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	You know, O_K. So the	no
13007	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And, um. O_K, in terms of the	no
13008	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Oh, I should've -	no
13009	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I was just thinking I should have invited him to this	no
13010	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So.	no
13011	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13012	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Sorry.	no
13013	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah. Well that's O_K, I mean we'll -	no
13014	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, and it's t- and it	no
13015	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	didn't - didn't see it, uh,	no
13016	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And, uh, that's - that will enable us to do	no
13017	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	um, tight	no
13018	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	of the, uh, original	no
13019	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And um.	no
13020	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So,	no
13021	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	In terms of, like,	no
13022	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Do you - I know that you're al- also supplementing it further. Do you want to mention something about that c- Thilo, or - ?	no
13023	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Um, yeah. What - what I'm doing right now is I'm trying to	no
13024	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	include some information about which channel, uh, there's some speech	no
13025	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	in. But that's not working at the moment. I'm just trying to do this by comparing energies, uh -	no
13026	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K.	no
13027	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	normalizing energies and comparing energies of the different channels. And	no
13028	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	so to - to give the transcribers some information in which channel there's - there's speech in addition to - to the thing we - we did	no
13029	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	now which is just, uh, speech-nonspeech detection on the mixed file.	no
13030	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	This is good. Mm-hmm.	no
13031	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So I'm - I'm relying on - on the segmentation of the mixed file but I'm - I'm trying to	no
13032	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	subdivide the speech portions into	no
13033	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	different portions if there is some activity in - in	no
13034	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Excellent, so this'd be like w- e- providing also	no
13035	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	But -	no
13036	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13037	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Wonderful.	no
13038	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Um, something I guess I didn't put in the	no
13039	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	on that, uh,	no
13040	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	No,	no
13041	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, Dave Gelbart and I will be, uh, visiting with John	no
13042	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	who's interested in ar- in	no
13043	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Oh, he's doing array mikes.	no
13044	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13045	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And so we wanna see what commonality there is here. You know, maybe they'd wanna	no
13046	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	stick an array mike here when we're	no
13047	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, that would be neat.	no
13048	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13049	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	That would be really neat.	no
13050	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	it's - it's not a	no
13051	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Um, I	no
13052	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	we'll let you know what - what goes with that. Also had a completely unrelated thing. I had a, uh, discussion today with, uh, Birger Kollmeier who's a,	no
13053	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, a German, uh, scientist who's got a fair sized group	no
13054	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	but, uh, he does stuff with auditory models and he's very interested in directionality, and location, and -	no
13055	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	and, uh, head models and	no
13056	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	microphone things. And so, uh, he's - he and possibly a student, there w- there's, uh, a student of his who gave a talk here	no
13057	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	last year, uh, may come here, uh, in the fall for, uh, sort of a five month, uh, sabbatical. So he might be around.	no
13058	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Get him to give some talks and so on. But	no
13059	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
13060	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	That - that reminds me, I had a - a thought of an interesting	no
13061	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	somebody could try to do with	no
13062	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
13063	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	using signal energies from the	no
13064	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right.	no
13065	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Uh-huh.	no
13066	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well Dan - Dan had worked on that. Dan Ellis, yeah.	no
13067	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, based on -	no
13068	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Uh-huh.	no
13069	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Oh,	no
13070	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So that - that's the cross-correlation stuff, was -	no
13071	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13072	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	was doing b- beam-forming.	no
13073	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And so you could plot out who was sitting next to who and -	no
13074	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	A	no
13075	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, yeah.	no
13076	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	No, he did start on it.	no
13077	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	e- e- given that, the - the - the block of wood with the - the - the two mikes	no
13078	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
13079	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	if	no
13080	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13081	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	if - if someone who was on the axis between the two is talking, then you - you get a big peak	no
13082	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
13083	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, it - it - it	no
13084	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Hmm.	no
13085	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well I was just thinking, you know, as I was sitting here next to	no
13086	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13087	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	um,	no
13088	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	when he's	no
13089	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13090	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Oh, that's another cl- cue, that's true.	no
13091	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13092	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	yeah,	no
13093	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13094	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
13095	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13096	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right.	no
13097	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13098	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And -	no
13099	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Or who talks the loudest.	no
13100	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13101	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, well you have to - the appropriate normalizations are tricky, and - and - and are probably the key.	no
13102	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13103	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13104	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	You just search for Adam's voice on each individual microphone, you pretty much know where everybody's sitting.	no
13105	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13106	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13107	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah. We've switched positions recently so you can't -	no
13108	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K.	no
13109	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So those are just a little couple of news items.	no
13110	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Can I ask one thing? Uh, so, um,	no
13111	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Jonathan Fiscus expressed an interest in, uh,	no
13112	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yes.	no
13113	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Um, is there - I mean - b- And I	no
13114	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, leave for - uh, from here to make a two forty-five flight	no
13115	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	from - from Oakland.	no
13116	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right.	no
13117	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So it makes the scheduling a little bit tight but do you think that, um - that, uh, i- John Canny should be involved in this somehow or	no
13118	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	It's premature.	no
13119	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Fine.	no
13120	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Good.	no
13121	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Uh, he might be	no
13122	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K.	no
13123	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Is	no
13124	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	NIST has - has done a big meeting room - instrumented meeting room with video and microphone arrays, and	no
13125	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	very elaborate software. Is - is he the one working on that?	no
13126	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well	no
13127	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K.	no
13128	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah. No, I mean, that's what all this is	no
13129	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K. I had read some papers that looked like they had already done	no
13130	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	They	no
13131	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Uh, well I	no
13132	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Are they going to do	no
13133	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Hmm.	no
13134	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13135	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Hmm.	no
13136	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I	no
13137	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Oh, cuz what - what	no
13138	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	in terms of recording and also live room where you're interacting - the participants are interacting with the computer, and with the video, and lots of other stuff.	no
13139	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well, I'm - I'm - I'm not sure. All - all I know is that they've been talking to me about a project that they're	no
13140	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So.	no
13141	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K. Well -	no
13142	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	recording people meet- in meetings. And, uh, it is related to ours. They were interested in ours. They wanted to get some uniformity with us, uh, about the transcriptions and so on.	no
13143	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Alright.	no
13144	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And one -	no
13145	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	one, uh, difference from the	no
13146	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So, um, I mean, I'll just tell you the party line on that. The reason I	no
13147	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	was because, uh, the focus, uh, both of	no
13148	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, in impromptu situations. And	no
13149	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	we're	no
13150	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	actually	no
13151	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Hmm.	no
13152	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	But the thing we	no
13153	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	you were talking with, uh, one or more other people	no
13154	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	i- uh, in - in an p-	no
13155	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Um, so it was	no
13156	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So there's no like portable array of mikes?	no
13157	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	No. So there's - there's -	no
13158	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, there's a whole range of things - there's a whole	no
13159	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	the, uh - the	no
13160	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, Rutgers, and Brown, and other - other places,	no
13161	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, they have, uh, big arrays with, I don't know, a hundred - hundred mikes or something. And so there's a wall of mikes. And you get	no
13162	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Xerox.	no
13163	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Wow.	no
13164	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And it's - and, um,	no
13165	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	in	no
13166	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	sort of	no
13167	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I've	no
13168	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, it's r-	no
13169	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	how - how they can cut out noise.	no
13170	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	It's really neat stuff. And then they had the little ones, yeah.	no
13171	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And then they have	no
13172	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, our block of wood is unique. But the-	no
13173	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13174	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
13175	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	um -	no
13176	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So, yeah, there's - there's - there's a range of things that people do.	no
13177	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Huh.	no
13178	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Um, so if we connected up with somebody who was interested in doing that sort of thing that's - that's a	no
13179	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	that's	no
13180	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	"""um, are you recording"	no
13181	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right, right.	no
13182	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Um, right? And - and the	no
13183	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	it's a	no
13184	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	but it	no
13185	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So	no
13186	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well one thing I - I mean, I don't know. I mean, I	no
13187	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	an array of microphones. But couldn't you kind of	no
13188	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, channels when you're - later on? I mean, it seems like if the microphones don't	no
13189	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	you know,	no
13190	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	It's - it's just a lot of infrastructure that	no
13191	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I see. Fine.	no
13192	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	for our particular purpose we felt we didn't need to set up.	no
13193	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13194	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K.	no
13195	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, if ninety-nine percent of what you're doing is c- is shutting off	no
13196	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	But if you get somebody who's - who - who has that as a primary	no
13197	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	That's right, I mean if someone - if someone came in and said we really want to do it,	no
13198	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right.	no
13199	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I mean,	no
13200	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So to save that data you -	no
13201	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	You have to have one channel recording per mike in the array?	no
13202	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Is that -	no
13203	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well, uh, at	no
13204	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I usually do a mix.	no
13205	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	there's -	no
13206	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	What you save, I mean, if you're going to do research with it.	no
13207	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	There's - I - I don't know what they're going to do and I don't know how big their array is. Obviously if you were gonna save all of those channels for later research you'd use up a lot of space.	no
13208	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah. Hmm.	no
13209	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And, th-	no
13210	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well their software infrastructure had a very elaborate design for plugging in filters, and mixers, and all sorts of processing.	no
13211	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So that they can	no
13212	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13213	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mmm.	no
13214	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13215	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So it was, uh -	no
13216	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13217	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	But I mean, uh,	no
13218	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	for optimum flexibility	no
13219	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	you would have	no
13220	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Uh, oh, O_K, I see.	no
13221	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right?	no
13222	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So -	no
13223	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Sort of saving the	no
13224	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I mean, it seems -	no
13225	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13226	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	it seems to me that there's -	no
13227	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	you know, there are good political reasons for -	no
13228	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	for	no
13229	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	a number of sites - like right now S_R_I is probably gonna invest a	no
13230	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	um, but they'll be recording with video and they'll be -	no
13231	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	You know, it'd be	no
13232	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, make	no
13233	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	um, and just have this other information available. So,	no
13234	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	if we can get the investment in just for the infra- infrastructure and then,	no
13235	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I don't know, save it out or have whoever's	no
13236	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	save that data out, transfer it there, it'd be g- it'd be good to have - have the recording.	no
13237	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	You mean to - to actually get a microphone array and	no
13238	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I think.	no
13239	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well, if -	no
13240	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Even if we're not - I'm not sure about video. That's sort of an - video has a little different nature since	no
13241	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	right n- right now we're all being recorded but we're not being	no
13242	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Um, but it -	no
13243	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well, but I think we need a researcher	no
13244	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	then -	no
13245	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	To push it	no
13246	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	See the	no
13247	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, it took at	no
13248	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	to get together the hardware and the software, and debug stuff in - in the microphones, and in the boxes. And it was a really big deal.	no
13249	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And so I think we could get	no
13250	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
13251	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	e-	no
13252	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I	no
13253	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	For - for maximum flexibility later you really	no
13254	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	the person with the maximum energy or something like that. I mean, you - you want actually to -	no
13255	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	you want actually to have multiple channels being recorded so that you can -	no
13256	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And to	no
13257	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	we	no
13258	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	we've got eight people and - and six mikes. And	no
13259	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And we actually only have	no
13260	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	E-	no
13261	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13262	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
13263	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13264	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13265	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well if there's a way to say time - to sort of solve each of these f- those -	no
13266	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So suppose you can get an array in because there's some person at Berkeley who's interested and has	no
13267	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	equipment, uh, and suppose we can -	no
13268	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	as we	no
13269	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	who's	no
13270	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	and even if ICSI it- itself isn't.	no
13271	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Um, and it - it seems like as long as we can	no
13272	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	You know? The- So -	no
13273	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah. So I	no
13274	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13275	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And y- it'd certainly gets skew.	no
13276	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I mean it's just - it's worth considering as sort of	no
13277	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	once you make the up front investment	no
13278	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	not have to worry about the	no
13279	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I'm	no
13280	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Just -	no
13281	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	that, uh, there is	no
13282	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So	no
13283	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right.	no
13284	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So it would	no
13285	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	but if you're d- i- the	no
13286	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And - and so you	no
13287	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I see.	no
13288	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mmm.	no
13289	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So basically - or a hun- Yeah. So,	no
13290	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Or a	no
13291	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I'm kinda skeptical, but um I think that -	no
13292	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mmm.	no
13293	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So, uh, I don't think we can share the resource in	no
13294	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right, I mean at least they'd have the	no
13295	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And then we can offer up the	no
13296	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, we can o- offer the meetings, and the physical space, and - and - yeah, the transcripts, and so on.	no
13297	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right.	no
13298	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K.	no
13299	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right, I mean, just - it'd be nice if we have more information on the same	no
13300	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	and -	no
13301	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13302	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	But it's - if it's impossible or if it's a lot of effort then you have to just balance the two,	no
13303	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well I	no
13304	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	so -	no
13305	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right.	no
13306	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Uh, we'll see.	no
13307	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Is there an	no
13308	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I mean	no
13309	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	t-	no
13310	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	that	no
13311	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	you have an infrastructure problem, you have a problem with people not wanting to be video taped, and you have the problem that no one who's currently involved in the	no
13312	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Hmm.	no
13313	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So there's not enough interest to overcome all of -	no
13314	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
13315	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right.	no
13316	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	places that are interested in looking at	no
13317	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, w-	no
13318	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I - I have to u- u- mention the human subjects problems,	no
13319	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right, that's true.	no
13320	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, so it's, uh, people - people getting shy about it. There's this human subjects problem.	no
13321	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13322	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	There's the fact that then um,	no
13323	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	if - i- I- I've	no
13324	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	"you know, it's sort of like saying, ""uh, well we're primarily interested in - in some"	no
13325	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	"uh, but, uh, why don't we just throw a microphone out there."" I mean,"	no
13326	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	the	no
13327	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	once you	no
13328	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mmm.	no
13329	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And, uh, you	no
13330	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	NIST or L_D_C, or somebody like that I think is much better shape to do all that. We - there	no
13331	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
13332	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And, uh, hopefully it'll be useful.	no
13333	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Oh! Probably	no
13334	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	A permission form?	no
13335	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I was -	no
13336	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	You were here at a meeting	no
13337	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	You were here at a meeting before.	no
13338	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13339	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, and you - and you signed a form.	no
13340	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So.	no
13341	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Did you sign a form?	no
13342	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Oh, I	no
13343	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I'm	no
13344	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K.	no
13345	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13346	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K.	no
13347	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13348	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13349	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	You don't - you don't have to	no
13350	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, we - we -	no
13351	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well I	no
13352	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Can I verbally consent?	no
13353	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	We - we - we - we don't, uh -	no
13354	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	o-	no
13355	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	You're on recor- you're being recorded and -	no
13356	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13357	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	we don't - we don't perform electro-shock during these meetings, and -	no
13358	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I don't care. You can do whatever you want	no
13359	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Usually.	no
13360	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	yes
13361	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K.	no
13362	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Uh,	no
13363	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Transcriptions, O_K. Um, I thought about - there are maybe three	no
13364	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	aspects of this. So first of all, um, I've got eight transcribers.	no
13365	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Uh, seven of them are linguists.	no
13366	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	One of them is a graduate student in psychology.	no
13367	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Um,	no
13368	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Each - I gave each of them, uh, their own data set. Two of them have already	no
13369	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And	no
13370	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	How big is the data set?	no
13371	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Oh, it's - what I mean is	no
13372	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Ah, O_K.	no
13373	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	when to stop transcribing this one or - So I wanted to keep it	no
13374	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	clear whose data were whose, and - and -	no
13375	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Uh-huh.	no
13376	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	and so - And, uh,	no
13377	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	almost two hours in some - in some cases. So, you know, that means - you know, if we've got two already finished and they're working on -	no
13378	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Uh, right now all eight of them have differe- uh, uh,	no
13379	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Hope so. But the pre-segmentation really helps a huge amount. And, uh,	no
13380	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Wow.	no
13381	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K.	no
13382	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	just out of curiosity I asked one of	no
13383	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, sixty minutes transcription for every five minutes of real time. So it's about twelve to one, which is what we were thinking.	no
13384	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	It's well in the range.	no
13385	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K. Uh, these	no
13386	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	But it's word level, speaker change, the things that were mentioned. O_K, now I wanted to mention the, um,	no
13387	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	teleconference I had with, uh, Jonathan Fiscus. We spoke for an hour and a half	no
13388	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Hmm.	no
13389	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	and, um, had an awful lot of things in common. He, um,	no
13390	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	um, he in- indicated to me that they've - that he's been,	no
13391	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, looking, uh, uh, spending a lot of time with - I'm not quite sure the connection,	no
13392	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And I guess that - I mean, I - I need to	no
13393	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	the name that has developed for the system that Bird and Liberman developed	no
13394	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
13395	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So what	no
13396	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	for him to be able to experiment with	no
13397	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	System. And they	no
13398	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I - I - I explained to him in - in detail the, uh, conventions that we're using	no
13399	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	in this word level transcript. And, um,	no
13400	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	you know, I - I explained, you know, the reasons that - that we were not	no
13401	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	coding more elaborately and - and the focus on reliability.	no
13402	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	He expressed a lot of interest in reliability. It's like he's - he's really up on these things. He's - he's very -	no
13403	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Um,	no
13404	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Sorry, can you explain what the ATLAS - I'm not familiar with	no
13405	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well, you know, at this point I think -	no
13406	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Uh, well	no
13407	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	there - there is a way of viewing - Uh, whenever you have coding categories, um, and you're dealing with	no
13408	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, a taxonomy, then you can have branches that - that have	no
13409	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	alternative, uh,	no
13410	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	each of them. And it just ends up looking like a graphical representation.	no
13411	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Is - is -	no
13412	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Is ATLAS the - his annotated transcription	no
13413	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	graph stuff?	no
13414	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I don't remember the acronym. The - the one - the - what I	no
13415	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13416	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And that's basically what I based the format that	no
13417	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Oh. Oh.	no
13418	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I based it on their work almost	no
13419	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	data representation and a set of tools for manipulating	no
13420	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Is this the project that's sort of, uh, between, uh, NIST and - and, uh, a couple of other places? The - the -	no
13421	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
13422	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Including L_D_C.	no
13423	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yep.	no
13424	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, y- right, O_K.	no
13425	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm. Then there's their web site that has lots of papers. And I looked through them and they mainly had to do with this, um,	no
13426	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	this, uh, tree structure, uh, annotated tree diagram thing.	no
13427	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mmm.	no
13428	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So, um, um - and, you know, in terms of like the conventions that	no
13429	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	it - there - there's	no
13430	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right.	no
13431	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	"And he was, you know, very interested. And, ""oh, and how'd you handle this?"" And I said, ""well, you know, this way"" and -"	no
13432	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And - and we had a really nice conversation.	no
13433	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Um, O_K, now I	no
13434	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	direction is,	no
13435	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Brian	no
13436	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, c- I - He still has an account here. I told him he could S_S_H on and use multi-trans, and have a look at the already done, uh, transcription. And he - and he	no
13437	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And what he said was that, um, what they'll be providing is -	no
13438	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	will	no
13439	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And, um, that's, uh - You know, I need to get back to him and - and, uh, you know, explore that a little bit more and see what they'll be	no
13440	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Hmm.	no
13441	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	The p- the people -	no
13442	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Sorry, what?	no
13443	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	The - the folks that they're, uh, subcontracting out the transcription to, are they like court reporters or -	no
13444	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yes.	no
13445	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I don't think that they're	no
13446	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
13447	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Hmm.	no
13448	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, what they're	no
13449	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Like	no
13450	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Nu- it's mostly - it's for their speech recognition	no
13451	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yep.	no
13452	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	that they've hired these people to do.	no
13453	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	But aren't - they're -	no
13454	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Oh, so they're hiring them, they're coming. It's not a	no
13455	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well they - they	no
13456	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Ah! Oh. O_K.	no
13457	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I gotcha.	no
13458	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So most of it's ViaVoice, people reading their training material for that.	no
13459	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
13460	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Up to now it's been	no
13461	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yep, exactly. Yep.	no
13462	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
13463	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So, um, Adam sent them a C_D and	no
13464	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, cuz, you know, I mean, we wanted to have it so that they were in familiar f- terms with what they wanted to	no
13465	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	He downloaded	no
13466	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	from the C_D onto audio tapes. And apparently he did it	no
13467	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	one channel per	no
13468	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right.	no
13469	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And then what	no
13470	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	a- before they go be- beyond the	no
13471	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Check it and, you know, adjust it, and all that.	no
13472	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So each person gets	no
13473	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right.	no
13474	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K.	no
13475	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So if they hear something off in the distance they don't - they just go -	no
13476	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well, but that's O_K, because, you know, you'll do	no
13477	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I - I don't know.	no
13478	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I have t- I, you know I -	no
13479	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	But there could be problems, right? with that.	no
13480	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13481	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well if you're tran- if you got	no
13482	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	No, no. We're talking about	no
13483	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13484	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	No,	no
13485	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yes.	no
13486	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I sure	no
13487	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well I th- I	no
13488	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, I - I would think that it would be kind of hard to come out with - Yeah.	no
13489	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I - I think it's sort of hard just playing the - you know, just having	no
13490	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	files. And I - I mean, I	no
13491	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13492	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Uh, it's pretty hard to follow, especially	no
13493	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	One side.	no
13494	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I agree.	no
13495	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	there are a lot of words that are so reduced phonetically that make sense when you know what the person was saying before.	no
13496	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, that's -	no
13497	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13498	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And	no
13499	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Uh, it	no
13500	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13501	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	But I mean we had this - we've had this discussion many times. And the answer is we don't actually know the answer because we haven't tried both ways.	no
13502	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, we have.	no
13503	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well, except I can say that my transcribers use the	no
13504	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
13505	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	unless there's a	no
13506	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
13507	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right.	no
13508	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	In which case, you know, they - they wouldn't be able to catch	no
13509	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right.	no
13510	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well I think that - that might change if you wanted really fine	no
13511	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13512	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So.	no
13513	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	But they're not	no
13514	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right.	no
13515	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Actually, are th- so	no
13516	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	are they giving	no
13517	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well, I have to ask him. And that's - that's my email to him. That needs to be forthcoming. But - but the, uh - I	no
13518	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah. Cuz - O_K.	no
13519	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	it's hard to follow one channel of a conversation	no
13520	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	and if you're dealing	no
13521	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	transcribing the, uh, networks group talk and she said,	no
13522	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	"""I don't really"	no
13523	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Oh, I'd be curious to - to look at that.	no
13524	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Just out of curiosity, I mean -	no
13525	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	They also all have h- heavy	no
13526	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13527	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13528	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13529	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Given all of the	no
13530	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	is going on	no
13531	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Why not just do it all	no
13532	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Um, it's historical. I mean,	no
13533	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	"uh, it - ""boy, we'd really have to"	no
13534	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	"ramp up to do that"", you know, like we just did,"	no
13535	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
13536	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	and, um, here's, uh, a - a, uh, collaborating institution that's volunteered to	no
13537	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
13538	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So, that was a contribution they could make. Uh	no
13539	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
13540	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	in terms of time, money, you know? And it	no
13541	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I'm just wondering	no
13542	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Actu- yeah, Mar- Mari asked me the same	no
13543	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well we can talk about more details later.	no
13544	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	um, you know, yeah,	no
13545	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13546	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	whether to -	no
13547	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13548	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, so.	no
13549	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Hmm.	no
13550	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
13551	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	It's very - a real benefit having Brian involved because of his knowledge of what the - how the data need to be used and so what's useful to have in the format.	no
13552	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13553	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
13554	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	yes
13555	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	It's very - a real benefit having Brian involved because of his knowledge of what the - how the data need to be used and so what's useful to have in the format.	no
13556	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13557	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So, um, Liz, with - with the S_R_I recognizer,	no
13558	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K, so this is a, um,	no
13559	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I - I guess I	no
13560	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	and actually I should say this is what Don has b- uh, he's already been really helpful in, uh, chopping up these - So - so first of all you -	no
13561	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	um, I mean, for the S_R_I front-end,	no
13562	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	we really need to chop things up into pieces that are f- not too huge. Um, but second of all, uh -	no
13563	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	in	no
13564	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I don't know, at least	no
13565	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	have a lot of cross-ta- sorry, some of the	no
13566	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	segments if you're gonna do recognition,	no
13567	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, Don has been taking a	no
13568	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	first - the fir- the meeting that Jane transcribed which we	no
13569	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	told me why this	no
13570	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	the S_R_I re-	no
13571	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah. No. They - they were not	no
13572	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	and they -	no
13573	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	They were not -	no
13574	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mmm.	no
13575	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13576	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And aft- after a	no
13577	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So we have to sort of normalize	no
13578	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yep.	no
13579	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	we've taken that and chopped it into pieces based	no
13580	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	your, um,	no
13581	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And so that every - every	no
13582	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	that	no
13583	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	On - Just on the marks. Right?	no
13584	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Um, the	no
13585	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	then for forced alignment we actually don't know where -	no
13586	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	you know, in the	no
13587	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Oh,	no
13588	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I mean, if - if it's a whole conversation and we get a long, uh, you know,	no
13589	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	par- paragraph of - of talk, uh, I don't know how they	no
13590	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I understand.	no
13591	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	where. And, um, I think with -	no
13592	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well you would need to - like a forced alignment before you did the	no
13593	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	It's already chunked.	no
13594	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	they have a chunk and then they transcribes	no
13595	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	pre-segmentation and then correct it if necessary. But there's first a chunk and then a transcription. Then a chunk, then a transcription. That's great,	no
13596	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
13597	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	cuz the recognizer can -	no
13598	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Uh, it's all pretty good sized for the recognizer also.	no
13599	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right, and it - it helps that it's made based on	no
13600	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Good. Oh good.	no
13601	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	sort of heuristics	no
13602	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Th- but there's going to be a real problem, uh,	no
13603	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, the transcripts from I_B_	no
13604	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right.	no
13605	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Why not do a -	no
13606	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	a - a forced	no
13607	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	right now.	no
13608	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	That's what she's	no
13609	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Got uh six- sixty minutes of -	no
13610	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	you can	no
13611	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Now wasn't - I thought that one of the proposals was that I_B_M was going to do an initial forced alignment, after they -	no
13612	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, but -	no
13613	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I - I	no
13614	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	We'll have to talk to Brian.	no
13615	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	yeah, I'm	no
13616	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah. Maybe they have some - you know, maybe actually there	no
13617	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K.	no
13618	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Liz has some concerns and -	no
13619	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, I don't know, maybe it's saved	no
13620	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13621	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, it's just an unknown right now.	no
13622	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah. I - I need to - to	no
13623	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So.	no
13624	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right. But the - it	no
13625	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
13626	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	A good size. Good.	no
13627	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well, I -	no
13628	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right, cuz - y- yeah.	no
13629	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13630	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, the first transcribed meeting,	no
13631	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Um, I'm sure I have some but - but that's the one where we're, um, trai-	no
13632	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	February sixteenth I think.	no
13633	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Oh, I see. Oh,	no
13634	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	It's a little bit at odd to -	no
13635	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13636	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And actually	no
13637	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Uh-huh.	no
13638	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	um, we can	no
13639	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	the - the more data we have to try the - the	no
13640	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	good for - just to know as transcriptions are coming through the pipeline from the transcribers, just to sort of - we're playing around with sort of	no
13641	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, parameters f- on the recognizer, cuz that would be helpful.	no
13642	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
13643	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Excellent, good.	no
13644	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Especially as you get, en- more voices. The first meeting had I think just four people, yeah.	no
13645	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Four speakers, yeah.	no
13646	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
13647	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Oh, great, great.	no
13648	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	yes
13649	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So.	no
13650	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	That's great.	no
13651	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	there was an issue of, uh, suppose we get in the, uh, I guess it's enviable position although maybe it's just saying where the weak link is in the chain,	no
13652	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, where we - we, uh -	no
13653	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh,	no
13654	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	we have all the data transcribed and we have these transcribers and we were - we're - the -	no
13655	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	we're still a bit slow on feeding - at	no
13656	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	two questions come, is you know what - how - how do we -	no
13657	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, it's not really a problem at the moment cuz we haven't	no
13658	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And the other one is, um, uh, is there some good use that we can make of the	no
13659	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So, um, I - I can't remember how much we talked about this in this meeting but there was -	no
13660	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	We	no
13661	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And there is	no
13662	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	modification to	no
13663	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Uh, then it would be very - these people would be very good to shift over to finer grain encoding of overlaps. It's just a matter of, you know, providing -	no
13664	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	two overlapping segments in the same	no
13665	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	you know, just do a click and	no
13666	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right, so I think we talking about three level - three things. One - one was	no
13667	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
13668	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13669	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, we had s- had	no
13670	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	The types of overlaps -	no
13671	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	labelings, types of overlaps, and so forth that - that someone could do.	no
13672	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
13673	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Second was, uh, somewhat lower level just doing these more precise timings. And the third one is - is, uh, just a completely wild hair brained idea that	no
13674	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	if we have	no
13675	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	to take some subset of the data and do some	no
13676	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	potentially overlapping fashion, uh, the value of, uh, ar-	no
13677	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13678	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	You know, just sort of say, O_K, it's voiced from here to	no
13679	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Hmm!	no
13680	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	phonetic - uh, you know, phonemic and the phonetic analysis, and, uh,	no
13681	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	those things. Um, obviously that's	no
13682	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	That would be really valuable I think.	no
13683	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	but, uh, we could do it on some small subset.	no
13684	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Also if you're dealing with consonants that would be easier than vowels, wouldn't it? I mean, I would think that -	no
13685	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	that, uh, being able to code that there's a - a	no
13686	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Which one.	no
13687	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mmm.	no
13688	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I think vowels - vowels are I think	no
13689	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
13690	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well,	no
13691	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
13692	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	very close up there are places where whether it's a	no
13693	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm, O_K. Yeah, I'm sure. Uh, yeah, I - I know.	no
13694	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, but - but just saying what the -	no
13695	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	at that point because it's - you know, there's this movement from here to here and - and - and it's -	no
13696	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right.	no
13697	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	You're saying r- sort of remove the high level constraints and go bottom-up.	no
13698	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	so I-	no
13699	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yep, just	no
13700	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Then just say -	no
13701	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mmm.	no
13702	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	but that's, you know, sort of a traditional way of describing these things,	no
13703	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
13704	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	um, and -	no
13705	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, I mean, actually this might be a g- neat thing to talk to -	no
13706	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	That's nice.	no
13707	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Sort of. I mean, it's still -	no
13708	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13709	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	some sort of categories but - but something that allows for overlapping	no
13710	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	change of these things and then this would give some more	no
13711	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	ground work for people who were building statistical models that	no
13712	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	"""click, you're now in this state, which corresponds to this speech sound"" and so on."	no
13713	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.	no
13714	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So this is like gestural - uh, these g- Right.	no
13715	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, something like that. I mean, actually if we get into that it might be good to, uh, uh, haul	no
13716	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	John Ohala into this and ask his - his views on it I think.	no
13717	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13718	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right.	no
13719	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	But is - is the	no
13720	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Excellent.	no
13721	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	so that you can do	no
13722	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	um,	no
13723	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	or is it because you think there's a different kind of actual	no
13724	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	viewing meetings as being a - a neat way to get people talking naturally.	no
13725	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And then you have i- and then - and then it's natural in	no
13726	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Just a source of data?	no
13727	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	you know, one might have,	no
13728	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Uh-huh.	no
13729	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13730	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right.	no
13731	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13732	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	so I think that given that it's that kind of corpus, if it's gonna be a very useful corpus	no
13733	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	um, if you say w- O_K, we've limited the use by some of our, uh, uh,	no
13734	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	we don't have the video, we don't - and so forth,	no
13735	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	but there's a	no
13736	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
13737	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And, uh, most of the things we've talked about have been fairly	no
13738	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	being kind of a bottom-up person I thought maybe we'd,	no
13739	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Hmm.	no
13740	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	It's a nice balance. That would be really nice to offer those things with that	no
13741	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right. Yeah, that would be good.	no
13742	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right.	no
13743	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah and	no
13744	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13745	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, I mean, people have made a	no
13746	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right.	yes
13747	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, I mean, people have made a	no
13748	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	That's true.	no
13749	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I guess I wanted to, um,	no
13750	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	sort of make a pitch for trying to	no
13751	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13752	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	what, vehemently said no	no
13753	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13754	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	"you know, ""well, Liz, come to the meeting tomorrow and try to"	no
13755	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
13756	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	if we can try, uh, to convince them because they have -	no
13757	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Good.	no
13758	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And they have very interesting meetings from the point of view of	no
13759	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
13760	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	a very different	no
13761	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Um -	no
13762	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	You mean in terms of the	no
13763	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well, yes and in terms of the -	no
13764	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	the fact that they're describing	no
13765	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
13766	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
13767	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Um, so I'll try. And then the	no
13768	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I don't know if this is at all useful, but I asked	no
13769	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	maybe go around and talk to the different	no
13770	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	departments in this building	no
13771	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yes.	no
13772	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	to see if there's any groups that, for a free lunch, if we can still	no
13773	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	You mean non-ICSI?	no
13774	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Great.	no
13775	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	non-ICSI, non-academic, you know, like government people, I don't know. So.	no
13776	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, I guess you - you can	no
13777	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	The	no
13778	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	It would be	no
13779	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13780	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13781	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Also it	no
13782	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13783	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Is -	no
13784	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well, tha- I think that's her point.	no
13785	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right, and then we could also - we might try advertising again because I think it'd be good if - if we can get a few different	no
13786	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13787	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	sort of non-internal types of meetings and just also more data.	no
13788	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13789	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And I think, uh, if we could get -	no
13790	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
13791	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So.	no
13792	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	"So I actually wrote to him and he answered, ""great, that sounds really interesting"". But I never heard back because we didn't actually advertise"	no
13793	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I mean w-	no
13794	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I told - I d- asked him	no
13795	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Um, and it	no
13796	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13797	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
13798	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	You	no
13799	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Um, so it's still worthwhile.	no
13800	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	it would be	no
13801	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So -	no
13802	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	do it each time.	no
13803	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah. That's right.	no
13804	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	and I was thinking -	no
13805	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	He- he's supposed - he's supposed to be trained	no
13806	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13807	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K, next	no
13808	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13809	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	you know, a s- a student. And I'm willing to try to learn. I mean, I'm -	no
13810	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I would do my best.	no
13811	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Um, the	no
13812	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	It's not that hard.	no
13813	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	there was a number of things at the transcription side	no
13814	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	that, um,	no
13815	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	transcribers can do, like dialogue act tagging,	no
13816	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	things that are in the speech that are actually	no
13817	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	something we're y-	no
13818	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	"process a utterance and the first thing they say is, ""well"", and that ""well"" is coded as some kind of interrupt"	no
13819	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	u-	no
13820	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	tag. Uh, and things like that, um,	no
13821	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Of course	no
13822	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	th-	no
13823	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	A lot of it can be done -	no
13824	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	to some degree	no
13825	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I think there's a second pass and I don't really know what would exist in it. But there's definitely a second pass worth	no
13826	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
13827	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	doing to maybe encode some kinds of, you know, is it a question or not, or -	no
13828	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	um, that maybe these transcribers could do.	no
13829	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So -	no
13830	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	They'd be really good. They're - they're very - they're very consistent. Uh, I wanted to - whi- while we're - Uh, so, to return just	no
13831	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13832	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
13833	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	That'd be great.	no
13834	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I have	no
13835	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I know that they recorded	no
13836	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I think they're open to it. I think, you know,	no
13837	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Oh, yeah.	no
13838	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	we should go beyond, uh, ICSI but, I mean, there's a	no
13839	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
13840	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So it's just - Yeah. So the -	no
13841	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Oh, that we	no
13842	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	No, no. No. So th- there was the	no
13843	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So.	no
13844	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	and, uh, the notion was raised before that that could happen. And it just, you know - it just didn't come	no
13845	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Just - O_K.	no
13846	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well, and - and the	no
13847	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	capability thing.	no
13848	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Oh.	no
13849	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right.	no
13850	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13851	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right. That was a big	no
13852	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	That's important.	no
13853	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So.	no
13854	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	fear.	no
13855	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, so I mean there's possibilities there.	no
13856	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K.	no
13857	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well, I don't know if they	no
13858	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Um, ugh,	no
13859	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Uh, i- i-	no
13860	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Joe Sokol?	no
13861	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13862	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13863	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	When - with him gone,	no
13864	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	it sorta trickled	no
13865	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13866	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
13867	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yep.	no
13868	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	We might be able to get the administration -	no
13869	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well he was sort of my	no
13870	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K.	no
13871	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I see that Lila has a luncheon meeting in here periodically. I don't know -	no
13872	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, I mean, it -	no
13873	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I'd really like to look at - to get	no
13874	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And so I was thinking if there's any like Berkeley	no
13875	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Who's willing to get recorded and distributed?	no
13876	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well, you know, something - Um -	no
13877	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, I don't think the more political argumentative ones would be willing to -	no
13878	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13879	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13880	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well, O_K. No, but maybe stu-	no
13881	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13882	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13883	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13884	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13885	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13886	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, of course there	no
13887	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13888	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Film-maker.	no
13889	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Of beeps, yeah.	no
13890	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13891	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
13892	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Is -	no
13893	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yes.	no
13894	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And I don't mean that they're angry but just something with some more variation in prosodic contours and so forth would be neat. So if anyone has ideas,	no
13895	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I'm willing to do the leg work to go try to talk to people but I don't really know which groups are worth	no
13896	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well there	no
13897	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	pursuing.	no
13898	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	No that's -	no
13899	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K.	no
13900	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Legal.	no
13901	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	um	no
13902	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	commercial value of - of st- uh, it - it - it - it turned out to be a bit of a problem.	no
13903	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K, O_K.	no
13904	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Or -	no
13905	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	primar- uh y- a	no
13906	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	meetings which were all English speakers. Now he wasn't trying to shape us in terms of what we	no
13907	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
13908	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	that's what he wanted me to	no
13909	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So I'm giving him our, um - our initial	no
13910	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Did he mean, uh - did he mean and non-British?	no
13911	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Of all - all nat- all native speakers.	no
13912	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well -	no
13913	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	The all native.	no
13914	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	That's what I mean, yeah.	no
13915	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well if he meant and non-	no
13916	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	He doesn't care. No. Eh, well,	no

14028	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well, let's - w- i- isn't that what - what you want -	no
14029	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	t-	no
14030	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	No, so - No, i- w- wha- what you - what you want - when you're saying improving the wave form you want the close talking microphone to be better. Right?	no
14031	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right.	no
14032	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And the question is to w- to what extent is it getting hurt	no

14044	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	yeah, what you said,	no
14045	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	All I meant is just that as sort of -	no
14046	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	as this pipeline of research is going on we're also experimenting with different	no

14054	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
14055	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	But if they're talking at all and they're not talking the whole time,	no
14056	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And the person in the middle who said only a	no
14057	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
14058	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	The energy, right. Exactly.	no

14108	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	you - you'll get, a- uh - an alignment with the wrong duration pattern or it -	no

14116	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
14117	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Um, and this problem is a little bit j- more	no

14119	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
14120	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So, uh,	no
14121	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	but we probably	no

14296	transcript	transcript_Bro015	uh wanted to mention a couple little bits of news.	no
14297	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Um Hynek is supposed to come for a couple days next week.	no
14298	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Don't know which days yet.	no
14299	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Um.	no
14300	transcript	transcript_Bro015	we're starting to talk about maybe having Sunil come here uh for some chunk of the summer.	no
14301	transcript	transcript_Bro015	So that may or may not happen but	no
14302	transcript	transcript_Bro015	shift	no
14303	transcript	transcript_Bro015	cuz Sunil will be here and	no
14304	transcript	transcript_Bro015	So.	no
14305	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Uh.	no
14306	transcript	transcript_Bro015	That's my news.	no
14307	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Alright.	no
14308	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Cool. I need a	no
14309	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Oh, O_K.	no
14310	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Yeah.	no
14311	transcript	transcript_Bro015	That's cool.	no
14312	transcript	transcript_Bro015	There you go.	no
14313	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Right.	no
14314	transcript	transcript_Bro015	It will be some- sometime in summer. July or August, or.	no
14315	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Yeah, I mean it may not happen. I mean he wants - uh I think he wants some experience someplace else and he's - he's uh	no
14316	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Mm-hmm.	no
14317	transcript	transcript_Bro015	But y- I don't know maybe June.	no
14318	transcript	transcript_Bro015	more specifically t- for Aurora um	no
14319	transcript	transcript_Bro015	uh they are not decide on	no
14320	transcript	transcript_Bro015	For the V_A_D they - probably they will do something like	no
14321	transcript	transcript_Bro015	of the SpeechDat-Car	no
14322	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Mm-hmm.	no
14323	transcript	transcript_Bro015	and apply them on channel one so it's -	no
14324	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Oh so take a	no
14325	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Uh g-	no
14326	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Yeah, to the	no
14327	transcript	transcript_Bro015	clean data.	no
14328	transcript	transcript_Bro015	And - and i- when they're talking about it, do you have the impression that they're talking about	no
14329	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Mm-hmm.	no
14330	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Um.	no
14331	transcript	transcript_Bro015	So they would just provide that as part of the data.	no
14332	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Yeah. Sounds like they're still arguing. Yeah.	no
14333	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Yeah, they're still	no
14334	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Yeah.	no
14335	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Um I don't know what -	no
14336	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Yeah.	no
14337	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Nothing much. Yeah. Probably the um -	no
14338	transcript	transcript_Bro015	these weight things, they will	no
14339	transcript	transcript_Bro015	apply the same kind of weighting scheme for	no
14340	transcript	transcript_Bro015	T_I-digits than for the SpeechDat-Car.	no
14341	transcript	transcript_Bro015	So it would be weighting of	no
14342	transcript	transcript_Bro015	It would be an average of improvements rather than an average of	no
14343	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Mm-hmm.	no
14344	transcript	transcript_Bro015	parts of T_I-digits more important than they are right now.	no
14345	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Uh but it sounds like none of this is really decided, that this is how things are leaning and -	no
14346	transcript	transcript_Bro015	They - they t- I think they will tend to go this way, but hmm.	no
14347	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Yeah, if we have the result for the tandem with um M_S_G also	no
14348	transcript	transcript_Bro015	So	no
14349	transcript	transcript_Bro015	so there is	no
14350	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Um.	no
14351	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Yeah, basically that's all.	no
14352	transcript	transcript_Bro015	We've started to work on some kind of report for the work	no
14353	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Mm-hmm.	no
14354	transcript	transcript_Bro015	more results. Hmm.	no
14355	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Yeah you have a uh - you have a lunch talk sometime in -	no
14356	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Mm-hmm.	no
14357	transcript	transcript_Bro015	It's next week, yeah.	no
14358	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Next week? Oh, O_K.	no
14359	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Uh	no
14360	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Oh yes. But,	no
14361	transcript	transcript_Bro015	no. This week I'm -	no
14362	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Ah.	no
14363	transcript	transcript_Bro015	I stopped it. Interfered. Yeah.	no
14364	transcript	transcript_Bro015	You stopped working on it I see	no
14365	transcript	transcript_Bro015	O_K. Uh.	no
14366	transcript	transcript_Bro015	So it sounds like basically things are slowing down a bit? And - and - and trying to	no
14367	transcript	transcript_Bro015	collate results? and	no
14368	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Mm-hmm.	no
14369	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Yeah.	no
14370	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Um. Yeah. Right now, Sunil seems i- is in India actually.	no
14371	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Right.	no
14372	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Right. But that sort of puts it on us to do it. But.	no
14373	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Um. And -	no
14374	transcript	transcript_Bro015	I'm sorry?	no
14375	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Kind of puts it on us to put more in, then,	no
14376	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Yeah.	no
14377	transcript	transcript_Bro015	I mean. Uh. Who's - who's - was uh looking at the combination of uh spectral s- subtraction approaches with what we had for instance.	no
14378	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Sunil was	no
14379	transcript	transcript_Bro015	O_K.	no
14380	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Um.	no
14381	transcript	transcript_Bro015	He sent a bunch of - a bunch of results uh but I don't know what's the status of this. I	no
14382	transcript	transcript_Bro015	What was that again?	no
14383	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Mm-hmm.	no
14384	transcript	transcript_Bro015	And -	no
14385	transcript	transcript_Bro015	And it was not	no
14386	transcript	transcript_Bro015	better than what we had before.	no
14387	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Then he tried to put the on-line normalization and	no
14388	transcript	transcript_Bro015	it did not improve further, putting the on-line normalization, so.	no
14389	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Yeah.	no
14390	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Hmm.	no
14391	transcript	transcript_Bro015	O_K. Well -	no
14392	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Hmm.	no
14393	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Yeah. I - uh, I g- so I guess nothing has ever happened about uh making a standardized uh place where the software sits so that people can work with it, and	no
14394	transcript	transcript_Bro015	No. Well, I - I sent mails to start the - the process and I guess we should have to -	no
14395	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Well, we know most what we have to - to put in - in this.	no
14396	transcript	transcript_Bro015	So, I guess. Yeah, we m-	no
14397	transcript	transcript_Bro015	O_K.	no
14398	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Well, uh. Let's - let's come back to this uh later.	no
14399	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Um.	no
14400	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Um.	no
14401	transcript	transcript_Bro015	No. I didn't. Um, are you talking about -	no
14402	transcript	transcript_Bro015	H_T_K, or - ?	no
14403	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Uh, no. This week I haven't. I've been - my whole time's been taken up with uh	no
14404	transcript	transcript_Bro015	O_K.	no
14405	transcript	transcript_Bro015	u-	no
14406	transcript	transcript_Bro015	O_K.	no
14407	transcript	transcript_Bro015	covering things.	no
14408	transcript	transcript_Bro015	This may be a very short meeting. Uh.	no
14409	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Anything from	no
14410	transcript	transcript_Bro015	your side?	no
14411	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Uh, continuing readings	no
14412	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Uh. We're doing some background reading on phonetics.	no
14413	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Uh-huh.	yes
14414	transcript	transcript_Bro015	O_K.	no
14415	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Yeah.	no
14416	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Well um.	no
14417	transcript	transcript_Bro015	One thing in - in the paper Avendano and his collaborators wrote	no
14418	transcript	transcript_Bro015	subtracting the mean of the log spectral magnitude	no
14419	transcript	transcript_Bro015	and they said perhaps that limited their approach that it did not try to normalize the phase in any way.	no
14420	transcript	transcript_Bro015	So I'm - I'm going to start thinking about	no
14421	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Um. Si- if - if the um channel	no
14422	transcript	transcript_Bro015	So um perhaps just subtracting the mean of the phase would - would help.	no
14423	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Um but I don't know I th- I get the impression that they tried to do some things with the phase and they weren't successful.	no
14424	transcript	transcript_Bro015	O_K.	yes
14425	transcript	transcript_Bro015	O_K.	no
14426	transcript	transcript_Bro015	where th- uh for the Italian system they had done a series of experiments playing around with the um -	no
14427	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Mm-hmm.	no
14428	transcript	transcript_Bro015	it turns out that the one that they're actually using was not the best, uh in - in their series of experiments, which I uh - Maybe it's because they	no
14429	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Sure. Wh- who's	no
14430	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Uh, I don't know	no
14431	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Um.	no
14432	transcript	transcript_Bro015	I don't know but it's the company who prepared the Italian database, so it was - Is it Alcatel, or - ?	no
14433	transcript	transcript_Bro015	I	no
14434	transcript	transcript_Bro015	I -	no
14435	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Mmm.	no
14436	transcript	transcript_Bro015	I don't know.	no
14437	transcript	transcript_Bro015	So um	no
14438	transcript	transcript_Bro015	all different of kinds of variations, and that would let us, you know, pump through a lot more experiments.	no
14439	transcript	transcript_Bro015	pointer about uh	no
14440	transcript	transcript_Bro015	so that you can do that.	no
14441	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Oh!	no
14442	transcript	transcript_Bro015	The other th- the other experiment that they had in that paper was uh uh playing with the number of Gaussians per state.	no
14443	transcript	transcript_Bro015	And so.	no
14444	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Uh.	no
14445	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Mm-hmm.	no
14446	transcript	transcript_Bro015	I think it's - was playing with the number of states per word. They had sixteen, seventeen, eighteen.	no
14447	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Yeah, because it was around - between sixteen and twenty or -	no
14448	transcript	transcript_Bro015	O_K. I should look at that more carefully cuz I wonder	no
14449	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Yeah.	no
14450	transcript	transcript_Bro015	what	no
14451	transcript	transcript_Bro015	they did about -	no
14452	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Oh, O_K. I was thinking it was Gaussians but it's states. O_K.	no
14453	transcript	transcript_Bro015	So, and -	no
14454	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Yeah, apparently,	no
14455	transcript	transcript_Bro015	um	no
14456	transcript	transcript_Bro015	From - from eighteen to twenty, or -	no
14457	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Mm-hmm.	no
14458	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Yeah.	no
14459	transcript	transcript_Bro015	So.	no
14460	transcript	transcript_Bro015	uh make the silence model more powerful, you know, increasing the number of Gaussians to the number of states, different - different things like that, so.	no
14461	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Um.	yes
14462	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Um.	no
14463	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Why don't - why don't we uh - if there aren't any other major things, why don't we do the digits, and then - then uh turn the mikes off.	no
14464	transcript	transcript_Bro015	So I'll start.	no

15231	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Mm-hmm.	no
15232	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	and then h-	no
15233	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	and then	no

15240	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	people who have had to do this -	no
15241	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I mean the only thing is	no
15242	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I wonder if	no
15243	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I mean there's - than -	no
15244	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	than what's been done in the past	no
15245	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	than discourse analyzers	no
15246	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	because	no
15247	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	maybe we have different requirements in terms of time align-	no
15248	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	you know, how much	no
15249	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	and uh how much detail in terms of people.	no
15250	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Oh,	no
15251	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	But that's a s-	no
15252	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Mm-hmm. O_K.	no
15253	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I don- I don't know how much ti- I don't think we	no
15254	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I think we just have	no
15255	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	basically one text file which runs from beginning to end.	no
15256	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Well, if - in terms of	no
15257	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	nice to get the actual	no
15258	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	time.	no
15259	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Sure.	no
15260	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	But not if it	no
15261	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Right.	no
15262	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Well, O_K. So what	no
15263	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	was	no
15264	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	at least,	no
15265	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I mean, the	no
15266	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	was that they had	no
15267	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	and they	no
15268	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	um	no
15269	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	analyzed it in terms of,	no
15270	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	"you know, """	no
15271	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	and of course that gets really	no
15272	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	difficult when you're talking about - I mean, this is some of the stuff that you were	no
15273	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Mm-hmm.	no
15274	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	talking about in	no
15275	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	uh	no
15276	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	your lunch talk, is that - is that	no
15277	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Right.	no
15278	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	you know, you get backchannels and stuff like that, that	no
15279	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	that,	no
15280	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	you know, disrupt the	no
15281	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	um	no
15282	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	the	no
15283	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Yeah.	no
15284	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	segment- you know the	no
15285	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	segmentation.	no
15286	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	the - it's sort of it's - a little -	no
15287	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	In some sense it's a little bit easier with it - with	no
15288	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	actually people	no
15289	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	are less flexible in what they do. In this kind of situation where	no
15290	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	we've got	no
15291	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	nonverbal	no
15292	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	channels	no
15293	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	and there's just that it's not a very good model.	no
15294	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Right.	no
15295	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Oh,	no
15296	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	in terms of	no
15297	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I mean,	no
15298	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	you have the	no
15299	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	you know, every	no
15300	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	a single speaker.	no
15301	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I mean, is	no
15302	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Well,	no
15303	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	every utterance is a single	no
15304	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	It's just that utterances can	no
15305	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I mean,	no
15306	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Is that the right way to do it?	no
15307	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I think - I think - I mean, I think when I'm - when -	no
15308	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	O_K.	no
15309	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Like, So,	no
15310	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	and that should be like one	no
15311	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	utterance	no
15312	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	and then	no
15313	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	and they should be just overlapping	no
15314	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I don't think that we should	no
15315	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	O_K. So that means that for each	no
15316	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Right.	no
15317	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	the start and end of each	no
15318	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Yeah.	no
15319	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	So.	no
15320	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	So -	no
15321	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Well, we'll have to	no
15322	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	but we can't necessarily -	no
15323	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I mean, we - we	no
15324	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	if we	no
15325	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	give them	no
15326	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	but	no
15327	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	we may	no
15328	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	in which case we'll have to get them	no
15329	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	some	no
15330	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	you know all this	no
15331	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Mm-hmm.	no
15332	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	So we - maybe we should look at the um -	no
15333	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	the tools that Mississippi State has.	no
15334	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Because, I d- I - I know that they published	no

16501	transcript	transcript_Bro007	we're looking at a	yes
16502	transcript	transcript_Bro007	we're looking at a	no
16503	transcript	transcript_Bro007	number of uh	no
16504	transcript	transcript_Bro007	things we're trying	no
16505	transcript	transcript_Bro007	and uh	no
16506	transcript	transcript_Bro007	fortunately for listeners to this uh	no
16507	transcript	transcript_Bro007	we lost some of it's visual	no
16508	transcript	transcript_Bro007	but um	no
16509	transcript	transcript_Bro007	got tables in front of us.	no
16510	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Um	no
16511	transcript	transcript_Bro007	what is - what does combo mean?	no
16512	transcript	transcript_Bro007	So combo is um	no
16513	transcript	transcript_Bro007	a system where we have these features	no
16514	transcript	transcript_Bro007	that go through a network and then	no
16515	transcript	transcript_Bro007	this same string of features but low-pass filtered with the low-pass filter used in	no
16516	transcript	transcript_Bro007	the M_S_G features.	no
16517	transcript	transcript_Bro007	And so these low-pass filtered	no
16518	transcript	transcript_Bro007	goes through M_ eh - another M_L_P	no
16519	transcript	transcript_Bro007	and then the linear output of these two M_L_P's are combined	no
16520	transcript	transcript_Bro007	just by adding the values and then there is this K_L_T.	no
16521	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Um	no
16522	transcript	transcript_Bro007	the output is used as	no
16523	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh features as well.	no
16524	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Um	no
16525	transcript	transcript_Bro007	so	no
16526	transcript	transcript_Bro007	let me try to restate this and see if I have it right.	no
16527	transcript	transcript_Bro007	There is uh -	no
16528	transcript	transcript_Bro007	there is the features	no
16529	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh there's the O_G_I features	no
16530	transcript	transcript_Bro007	and	no
16531	transcript	transcript_Bro007	then um	no
16532	transcript	transcript_Bro007	those	no
16533	transcript	transcript_Bro007	features	no
16534	transcript	transcript_Bro007	um	no
16535	transcript	transcript_Bro007	go through a contextual - uh l- l- let's take this bottom arr-	no
16536	transcript	transcript_Bro007	one pointed to by the bottom arrow.	no
16537	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Um those features	no
16538	transcript	transcript_Bro007	go through a contextualized K_L_T.	no
16539	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
16540	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Then	no
16541	transcript	transcript_Bro007	these features also	no
16542	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh get	no
16543	transcript	transcript_Bro007	um low-pass filtered	no
16544	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah so	no
16545	transcript	transcript_Bro007	yeah I could perhaps draw this on the blackboard	no
16546	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Sure.	no
16547	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah. Yeah.	no
16548	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
16549	transcript	transcript_Bro007	The graph, yeah another one.	no
16550	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah, that's good.	no
16551	transcript	transcript_Bro007	So	no
16552	transcript	transcript_Bro007	So we have these features from O_G_I	no
16553	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
16554	transcript	transcript_Bro007	that goes through the three paths.	no
16555	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Three, O_K.	no
16556	transcript	transcript_Bro007	The first	no
16557	transcript	transcript_Bro007	is a K_L_T using	no
16558	transcript	transcript_Bro007	several	no
16559	transcript	transcript_Bro007	frames	no
16560	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
16561	transcript	transcript_Bro007	of the features.	no
16562	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
16563	transcript	transcript_Bro007	The second path	no
16564	transcript	transcript_Bro007	is uh M_L_P	no
16565	transcript	transcript_Bro007	also using nine frames - several frames of features	no
16566	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
16567	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh-huh.	no
16568	transcript	transcript_Bro007	The third path	no
16569	transcript	transcript_Bro007	is this low-pass filter.	no
16570	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh-huh.	no
16571	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh, M_L_P	no
16572	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Aha! aha!	no
16573	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Adding the outputs just like in the second propose- the - the proposal from - for the first evaluation.	no
16574	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah?	no
16575	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
16576	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
16577	transcript	transcript_Bro007	And then	no
16578	transcript	transcript_Bro007	No, the K_L_T.	no
16579	transcript	transcript_Bro007	the K_L_T	no
16580	transcript	transcript_Bro007	And those two together.	no
16581	transcript	transcript_Bro007	and then the two together again.	no
16582	transcript	transcript_Bro007	That's it.	no
16583	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Two H_T_K.	no
16584	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Um.	no
16585	transcript	transcript_Bro007	O_K so that's - that's this bottom one.	no
16586	transcript	transcript_Bro007	So	no
16587	transcript	transcript_Bro007	this is - yeah	no
16588	transcript	transcript_Bro007	And so uh	no
16589	transcript	transcript_Bro007	and then the - the - the one at the top - and I presume these things that uh are in yellow are in yellow because overall they're the best?	no
16590	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah that's the reason, yeah.	no
16591	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Oh let's focus on them then- so what's the block diagram for the one above it?	no
16592	transcript	transcript_Bro007	For the f- the f- first	no
16593	transcript	transcript_Bro007	yellow line you mean?	no
16594	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
16595	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah	no
16596	transcript	transcript_Bro007	so it's uh basically s- the same except that we don't have this	no
16597	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Step.	no
16598	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh low-pass filtering so we have only two streams.	no
16599	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Well.	no
16600	transcript	transcript_Bro007	There's - there's no	no
16601	transcript	transcript_Bro007	low -	no
16602	transcript	transcript_Bro007	low-pass processing	no
16603	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mm-hmm.	no
16604	transcript	transcript_Bro007	used as additional feature stream.	no
16605	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mm-hmm.	no
16606	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Um	no
16607	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Do you e- um they mentioned - made some - uh when I was on the phone with Sunil they - they mentioned some	no
16608	transcript	transcript_Bro007	weighting	no
16609	transcript	transcript_Bro007	scheme that was used to evaluate all of these numbers.	no
16610	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
16611	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh actually the way things seems to	no
16612	transcript	transcript_Bro007	um well	no
16613	transcript	transcript_Bro007	it's uh	no
16614	transcript	transcript_Bro007	forty percent for T_I-digit, sixty for	no
16615	transcript	transcript_Bro007	all the SpeechDat-Cars, well all these languages.	no
16616	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Ehm	no
16617	transcript	transcript_Bro007	the well match is forty, medium thirty five and high mismatch twenty-five.	no
16618	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
16619	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Um and we don't have the T_I-digits part yet?	no
16620	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh, no.	no
16621	transcript	transcript_Bro007	O_K.	no
16622	transcript	transcript_Bro007	But	no
16623	transcript	transcript_Bro007	yeah.	no
16624	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Generally what you observe with T_I-digits is that the result are very close	no
16625	transcript	transcript_Bro007	whatever the - the system.	no
16626	transcript	transcript_Bro007	O_K.	no
16627	transcript	transcript_Bro007	And so	no
16628	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
16629	transcript	transcript_Bro007	have you	no
16630	transcript	transcript_Bro007	put all these numbers together	no
16631	transcript	transcript_Bro007	into a single number representing that? I mean not -	no
16632	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh not yet. No.	no
16633	transcript	transcript_Bro007	O_K so that should be pretty easy to do and that would be good - then we could compare the two and say what was better.	no
16634	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mmm yeah, yeah.	no
16635	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mmm.	no
16636	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
16637	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Um	no
16638	transcript	transcript_Bro007	and how does this compare	no
16639	transcript	transcript_Bro007	to the numbers -	no
16640	transcript	transcript_Bro007	oh so O_G_I two is just the top -	no
16641	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
16642	transcript	transcript_Bro007	top row?	no
16643	transcript	transcript_Bro007	So yeah to -	no
16644	transcript	transcript_Bro007	actually O_G_I two is the -	no
16645	transcript	transcript_Bro007	the baseline with the O_G_I features	no
16646	transcript	transcript_Bro007	but	no
16647	transcript	transcript_Bro007	this is not exactly the result that they have	no
16648	transcript	transcript_Bro007	because they've - they're still	no
16649	transcript	transcript_Bro007	made some changes in the	no
16650	transcript	transcript_Bro007	features	no
16651	transcript	transcript_Bro007	O_K.	no
16652	transcript	transcript_Bro007	and - well	no
16653	transcript	transcript_Bro007	but	no
16654	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh	no
16655	transcript	transcript_Bro007	actually	no
16656	transcript	transcript_Bro007	our results are better than their results.	no
16657	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Um	no
16658	transcript	transcript_Bro007	I don't know by how much because they did not send us the new results	no
16659	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh	no
16660	transcript	transcript_Bro007	O_K so the one - one place	no
16661	transcript	transcript_Bro007	where it looks like we're messing things up a bit is in the highly mismatched Italian.	no
16662	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah. Yeah.	no
16663	transcript	transcript_Bro007	An-	no
16664	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah there is something funny happening here because - yeah.	no
16665	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
16666	transcript	transcript_Bro007	But there are thirty-six and then	no
16667	transcript	transcript_Bro007	sometimes we are - we are - we are around forty-two and	no
16668	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Now up	no
16669	transcript	transcript_Bro007	but	no
16670	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh so	no
16671	transcript	transcript_Bro007	one of the ideas that you had mentioned last time was having a - a second um silence detection.	no
16672	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah. So there are	no
16673	transcript	transcript_Bro007	some results here	no
16674	transcript	transcript_Bro007	For the Italian. For this one.	no
16675	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh so the	no
16676	transcript	transcript_Bro007	third and the fifth line of the table	no
16677	transcript	transcript_Bro007	So filt is what that is?	no
16678	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Filt, yeah	no
16679	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
16680	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Um	no
16681	transcript	transcript_Bro007	yeah so it seems f- for the - the well match and mismatched condition	no
16682	transcript	transcript_Bro007	it's uh	no
16683	transcript	transcript_Bro007	it brings something.	no
16684	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh but	no
16685	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh actually	no
16686	transcript	transcript_Bro007	apparently there are - there's no	no
16687	transcript	transcript_Bro007	room left for any	no
16688	transcript	transcript_Bro007	silence detector	no
16689	transcript	transcript_Bro007	at the server side because of the delay.	no
16690	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh	no
16691	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Oh we can't do it. Oh O_K.	no
16692	transcript	transcript_Bro007	well	no
16693	transcript	transcript_Bro007	No.	no
16694	transcript	transcript_Bro007	For that - for that we -	no
16695	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Oh.	no
16696	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh	no
16697	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
16698	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Except I don't know because they -	no
16699	transcript	transcript_Bro007	I think they are still working well.	no
16700	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh-huh.	no
16701	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh t- two days ago they were still working on this	no
16702	transcript	transcript_Bro007	trying to reduce	no
16703	transcript	transcript_Bro007	the delay of the silence detector	no
16704	transcript	transcript_Bro007	so but	no
16705	transcript	transcript_Bro007	yeah if we had time perhaps we could try to find uh	no
16706	transcript	transcript_Bro007	some kind of compromise between the delay that's on the handset and on the server side.	no
16707	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Perhaps try to reduce the delay on the handset and -	no
16708	transcript	transcript_Bro007	but well hmm	no
16709	transcript	transcript_Bro007	For the moment they have this large delay on the -	no
16710	transcript	transcript_Bro007	the feature computation and	no
16711	transcript	transcript_Bro007	O_K.	no
16712	transcript	transcript_Bro007	So	no
16713	transcript	transcript_Bro007	so we don't	no
16714	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Alright so for now at least that's not	no
16715	transcript	transcript_Bro007	there	no
16716	transcript	transcript_Bro007	you have some results with low-pass filter cepstrum	no
16717	transcript	transcript_Bro007	doesn't have a huge effect but it - but it looks like it	no
16718	transcript	transcript_Bro007	you know maybe could help in a couple places.	no
16719	transcript	transcript_Bro007	I th-	no
16720	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
16721	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh little bit.	no
16722	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Um	no
16723	transcript	transcript_Bro007	and um	no
16724	transcript	transcript_Bro007	um	no
16725	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah	no
16726	transcript	transcript_Bro007	and uh	no
16727	transcript	transcript_Bro007	let's see	no
16728	transcript	transcript_Bro007	What else did we	no
16729	transcript	transcript_Bro007	have in there? Uh	no
16730	transcript	transcript_Bro007	I guess it makes a l- um at this point this is	no
16731	transcript	transcript_Bro007	I - I guess I should probably look at these others a little bit uh	no
16732	transcript	transcript_Bro007	And you - you yellowed these out uh but uh	no
16733	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh	no
16734	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Oh I see yeah that - that one you can't use because of the delay.	no
16735	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Those look pretty good.	no
16736	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Um	no
16737	transcript	transcript_Bro007	let's see that one	no
16738	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Well even the - just the - the second row doesn't look that bad right? That's just uh	no
16739	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yep.	no
16740	transcript	transcript_Bro007	yeah? And - and	no
16741	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mmm yeah.	no
16742	transcript	transcript_Bro007	that looks like an interesting one too.	no
16743	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh	no
16744	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Actually the - yeah the second line is	no
16745	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh	no
16746	transcript	transcript_Bro007	pretty much like the first line in yellow	no
16747	transcript	transcript_Bro007	except that we don't have this K_L_T on the first - on the left part of the diagram.	no
16748	transcript	transcript_Bro007	We just have the features	no
16749	transcript	transcript_Bro007	as they are.	no
16750	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mm-hmm.	no
16751	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Um	no
16752	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
16753	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah so when we do this weighted measure we should compare the two cuz it might even come out better.	no
16754	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mm-hmm.	no
16755	transcript	transcript_Bro007	And it's - it's - it's a little - slightly simpler.	no
16756	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
16757	transcript	transcript_Bro007	So -	no
16758	transcript	transcript_Bro007	so there's - so I - I would put that one also as a - as a maybe.	no
16759	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh	no
16760	transcript	transcript_Bro007	and it - yeah and it's	no
16761	transcript	transcript_Bro007	actually	no
16762	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh highly mismatched Italian, so	no
16763	transcript	transcript_Bro007	s- and little worse on the	no
16764	transcript	transcript_Bro007	mis- on the M_M case, but	no
16765	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh	no
16766	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Well yeah it's worse than a few things	no
16767	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mm-hmm.	no
16768	transcript	transcript_Bro007	so uh	no
16769	transcript	transcript_Bro007	let's see how that c- that c- c- see how that comes out on their -	no
16770	transcript	transcript_Bro007	their measure and - are - are we running this uh for T_I-digits or uh	no
16771	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
16772	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
16773	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Now is T_I di - is- is that part of the result that they get for the uh development - th- the results that they're supposed to get at the end of - end of the month, the T_I-digits are there also?	no
16774	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
16775	transcript	transcript_Bro007	It's included, yeah.	no
16776	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Oh O_K.	no
16777	transcript	transcript_Bro007	O_K.	no
16778	transcript	transcript_Bro007	And see what else there is here.	no
16779	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Um	no
16780	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Oh I see - the one - I was looking down here at the - the o- the row below the	no
16781	transcript	transcript_Bro007	lower yellowed one.	no
16782	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh that's	no
16783	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mm-hmm?	no
16784	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh	no
16785	transcript	transcript_Bro007	that's with the reduced uh K_L_T size -	no
16786	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
16787	transcript	transcript_Bro007	reduced dimensionality.	no
16788	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
16789	transcript	transcript_Bro007	What happens there	no
16790	transcript	transcript_Bro007	is it's around the same	no
16791	transcript	transcript_Bro007	and so you could reduce the dimension as you were saying	no
16792	transcript	transcript_Bro007	before a bit perhaps.	no
16793	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah, it's - it's significantly worse well but - Mm-hmm.	no
16794	transcript	transcript_Bro007	It's significantly worse - it's -	no
16795	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Exc- except for the H_M	no
16796	transcript	transcript_Bro007	it's uh	no
16797	transcript	transcript_Bro007	For many a mismatch it's worse.	no
16798	transcript	transcript_Bro007	but	no
16799	transcript	transcript_Bro007	it's - it's mostly worse.	no
16800	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
16801	transcript	transcript_Bro007	But it is little. I mean	no
16802	transcript	transcript_Bro007	not - not by a huge amount, I don't know.	no
16803	transcript	transcript_Bro007	What are - what are the sizes of any of these sets, I - I'm - I'm sure you told me before, but I've forgotten.	no
16804	transcript	transcript_Bro007	So - you know how many words	no
16805	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh	no
16806	transcript	transcript_Bro007	are in	no
16807	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh one of these test sets?	no
16808	transcript	transcript_Bro007	I don't remember.	no
16809	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Um	no
16810	transcript	transcript_Bro007	About?	no
16811	transcript	transcript_Bro007	it's -	no
16812	transcript	transcript_Bro007	it depends - well -	no
16813	transcript	transcript_Bro007	the well matched is generally larger	no
16814	transcript	transcript_Bro007	than the other sets	no
16815	transcript	transcript_Bro007	and I think it's around	no
16816	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Ye-	no
16817	transcript	transcript_Bro007	two thousand or three thousand words perhaps, at least.	no
16818	transcript	transcript_Bro007	But words -	no
16819	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Hmm?	no
16820	transcript	transcript_Bro007	well word - I don't know.	no
16821	transcript	transcript_Bro007	The words, yeah.	no
16822	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Sentences.	no
16823	transcript	transcript_Bro007	S- sentences.	no
16824	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Some sets have five hundred sentences,	no
16825	transcript	transcript_Bro007	so.	no
16826	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
16827	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mmm.	no
16828	transcript	transcript_Bro007	So the - so the sets - so the test sets are between five hundred and two thousand sentences, let's say	no
16829	transcript	transcript_Bro007	and each sentence on the average has four or five digits or is it - most of them longer or	no
16830	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah for the Italian	no
16831	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
16832	transcript	transcript_Bro007	It - it d-	no
16833	transcript	transcript_Bro007	even seven digits y- more or less but sometime	no
16834	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Seven digits.	no
16835	transcript	transcript_Bro007	the sentence have only one digit and sometime	no
16836	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh like uh the number of uh credit cards, something like that.	no
16837	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mm-hmm.	no
16838	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Right, so between one and sixteen. See the - I mean the reason I'm asking is - is - is we have all these small differences and I don't know	no
16839	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mm-hmm?	no
16840	transcript	transcript_Bro007	how seriously to take them, right? So	no
16841	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
16842	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh i- if - if you had uh just	no
16843	transcript	transcript_Bro007	you know - to give an example, if you had uh	no
16844	transcript	transcript_Bro007	um	no
16845	transcript	transcript_Bro007	if you had a thousand words	no
16846	transcript	transcript_Bro007	then uh a - a tenth of a percent would just be one word, right? So - so it wouldn't mean anything.	no
16847	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
16848	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
16849	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Oh	no
16850	transcript	transcript_Bro007	so um	no
16851	transcript	transcript_Bro007	yeah it be kind of - I'd kind of like to know what the	no
16852	transcript	transcript_Bro007	sizes of these test sets were actually.	no
16853	transcript	transcript_Bro007	The size that we have?	no
16854	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah. We could - we could run - run some kind of significance tests or	no
16855	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah since these -	no
16856	transcript	transcript_Bro007	well also just to know the numbers, right. So these - these are word error rates so this is on how many words.	no
16857	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
16858	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
16859	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yep.	no
16860	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah we have the result that the output of the H_T_K	no
16861	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
16862	transcript	transcript_Bro007	The number of -	no
16863	transcript	transcript_Bro007	of sentences, no it's the number isn't.	no
16864	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah sure - sure. Yeah sure. Yeah.	no
16865	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah so anyway if you could just mail out what those numbers are and then - then - that - that be great.	no
16866	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
16867	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Um	no
16868	transcript	transcript_Bro007	what else is there here?	no
16869	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Um see the second -	no
16870	transcript	transcript_Bro007	second from the bottom it says S_I_L, but this is some different kind of silence or thing or -	no
16871	transcript	transcript_Bro007	what was that?	no
16872	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh	no
16873	transcript	transcript_Bro007	It the -	no
16874	transcript	transcript_Bro007	the output silence of the M_L_P.	no
16875	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Oh yeah I see.	no
16876	transcript	transcript_Bro007	It's only one small experiment to know what happened.	no
16877	transcript	transcript_Bro007	To apply	no
16878	transcript	transcript_Bro007	also to in- include also the -	no
16879	transcript	transcript_Bro007	the silence of the M_L_P we have the fifty-six form and the silence to pick up the silence and we include those.	no
16880	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yes.	no
16881	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh-huh, uh-huh.	no
16882	transcript	transcript_Bro007	The silence plus the K_L_T output?	no
16883	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Oh so you're only using the silence.	no
16884	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
16885	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah, because when we apply	no
16886	transcript	transcript_Bro007	the K_L_T	no
16887	transcript	transcript_Bro007	No they're - I think there is this silence in addition to the um K_L_T outputs it is because we - we - we just keep	no
16888	transcript	transcript_Bro007	No.	no
16889	transcript	transcript_Bro007	in addition, yes. In addition t-	no
16890	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh we don't keep all the dimensions after the K_L_T	no
16891	transcript	transcript_Bro007	and - yeah.	no
16892	transcript	transcript_Bro007	and we not s- we are not sure if we pick - we have the silence.	no
16893	transcript	transcript_Bro007	So	no
16894	transcript	transcript_Bro007	we try to add the silence also in addition to the - these twenty-eight	no
16895	transcript	transcript_Bro007	dimensions.	no
16896	transcript	transcript_Bro007	I see.	no
16897	transcript	transcript_Bro007	O_K.	no
16898	transcript	transcript_Bro007	And what - and what's O_G_I forty-five?	no
16899	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh it's o- it's O_G_I two, it's - so the - th- it's the features from the first line	no
16900	transcript	transcript_Bro007	The bottom one there?	no
16901	transcript	transcript_Bro007	It's in fact O_G_I two.	no
16902	transcript	transcript_Bro007	and - yeah.	no
16903	transcript	transcript_Bro007	S-	no
16904	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Right, but I mean what's the - what does the last row mean?	no
16905	transcript	transcript_Bro007	So it's uh basically this but without the K_L_T	no
16906	transcript	transcript_Bro007	on the - from the left path.	no
16907	transcript	transcript_Bro007	I thought that was the one - I thought that was the second row.	no
16908	transcript	transcript_Bro007	So what's the difference between the second	no
16909	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh the second line you don't have this combo stuff so you just	no
16910	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh	no
16911	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Oh.	no
16912	transcript	transcript_Bro007	So this is like the second line but with - with the combo stuff.	no
16913	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
16914	transcript	transcript_Bro007	And with the - all the output of the combo.	no
16915	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
16916	transcript	transcript_Bro007	O_K.	no
16917	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh	no
16918	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
16919	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
16920	transcript	transcript_Bro007	O_K, so -	no
16921	transcript	transcript_Bro007	alright so it looks to me -	no
16922	transcript	transcript_Bro007	I guess the same -	no
16923	transcript	transcript_Bro007	given that we have to take the filt ones out of the - the running because of this delay problem -	no
16924	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mm-hmm.	no
16925	transcript	transcript_Bro007	so it looks to me like the ones you said	no
16926	transcript	transcript_Bro007	I agree are - are the ones to look at but I just would add the -	no
16927	transcript	transcript_Bro007	the - the second row one	no
16928	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
16929	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mmm.	no
16930	transcript	transcript_Bro007	and then um if we can um	no
16931	transcript	transcript_Bro007	oh yeah also	no
16932	transcript	transcript_Bro007	when -	no
16933	transcript	transcript_Bro007	when they're using this weighting scheme of forty, thirty-five, twenty-five	no
16934	transcript	transcript_Bro007	is that on the percentages or on the raw errors? I guess	no
16935	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh	no
16936	transcript	transcript_Bro007	it's probably on the percentages right?	no
16937	transcript	transcript_Bro007	I guess, yeah.	no
16938	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah O_K.	no
16939	transcript	transcript_Bro007	I guess, yeah. Mmm.	no
16940	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Alright.	no
16941	transcript	transcript_Bro007	It's not clear here.	no
16942	transcript	transcript_Bro007	O_K.	no
16943	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Um	no
16944	transcript	transcript_Bro007	O_K so if we can know what - how many words are in each and then um Dave uh	no
16945	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Dave promised to get us something tomorrow	no
16946	transcript	transcript_Bro007	which will be there	no
16947	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mm-hmm.	no
16948	transcript	transcript_Bro007	as far as they've gotten	no
16949	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
16950	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh how long did it	no
16951	transcript	transcript_Bro007	I guess if we're not doing all these things - if we're only doing	no
16952	transcript	transcript_Bro007	um	no
16953	transcript	transcript_Bro007	um	no
16954	transcript	transcript_Bro007	I guess since this is development data it's legitimate	no
16955	transcript	transcript_Bro007	to do more than one, right?	no
16956	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
16957	transcript	transcript_Bro007	I mean ordinarily if - in final test data you don't want to do	no
16958	transcript	transcript_Bro007	several	no
16959	transcript	transcript_Bro007	and - and take the best that's - that's -	no
16960	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mmm.	no
16961	transcript	transcript_Bro007	that's not proper but if this is development data we could still	no
16962	transcript	transcript_Bro007	look at a couple.	no
16963	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
16964	transcript	transcript_Bro007	We can - yeah. Sure. But	no
16965	transcript	transcript_Bro007	we have to decide - I mean we have to fix the system	no
16966	transcript	transcript_Bro007	on this d- on this data, to choose the best and	no
16967	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
16968	transcript	transcript_Bro007	I-	no
16969	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Right.	no
16970	transcript	transcript_Bro007	these	yes
16971	transcript	transcript_Bro007	these	no
16972	transcript	transcript_Bro007	But the question is when - when do we fix the system, do we fix the system uh tomorrow or do we fix the system on Tuesday?	no
16973	transcript	transcript_Bro007	But we could	no
16974	transcript	transcript_Bro007	it d-	no
16975	transcript	transcript_Bro007	I -	no
16976	transcript	transcript_Bro007	I think we fixed on Tuesday, yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm.	no
16977	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah, O_K except that we do have to write it up.	no
16978	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mm-hmm.	no
16979	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
16980	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
16981	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Um	no
16982	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh yeah well.	no
16983	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Well basically it's this with	no
16984	transcript	transcript_Bro007	perhaps some kind of printing and some - some other	no
16985	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Right so maybe what we do is we - we - we uh as soon as we get the data from them	no
16986	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah but	no
16987	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mm-hmm.	no
16988	transcript	transcript_Bro007	we start the training and so forth but we start the write-up right away	no
16989	transcript	transcript_Bro007	because as you say there - there's only minor differences between these.	no
16990	transcript	transcript_Bro007	I think you - we could - we could start soon, yeah.	no
16991	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
16992	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Write up something.	no
16993	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah, and -	no
16994	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Um yeah. Mm-hmm.	no
16995	transcript	transcript_Bro007	and I - I would - you know, I would - I'd kind of like to see it maybe I can - I can edit it a bit	no
16996	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh sure.	no
16997	transcript	transcript_Bro007	The - my - what in this si- i- in this situation is my forte which is English.	no
16998	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
16999	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh	no
17000	transcript	transcript_Bro007	so	no
17001	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mmm.	no
17002	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh	no
17003	transcript	transcript_Bro007	H- yeah. Have y- have you seen alt- d- do they have a format for how they want the system descriptions or anything?	no
17004	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh not really.	no
17005	transcript	transcript_Bro007	O_K.	no
17006	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Um	no
17007	transcript	transcript_Bro007	There is the format of the table which is	no
17008	transcript	transcript_Bro007	quite impressive.	no
17009	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah?	no
17010	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh	no
17011	transcript	transcript_Bro007	I see.	no
17012	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yes, for those who are listening to this and not looking at it uh it's not really that impressive, it's just tiny.	no
17013	transcript	transcript_Bro007	It's all these little categories	no
17014	transcript	transcript_Bro007	set a, set b, set c, multi-condition, clean.	no
17015	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh	no
17016	transcript	transcript_Bro007	No mitigation.	no
17017	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Wow.	no
17018	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Do you know what no - what no mitigation means	no
17019	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Um	no
17020	transcript	transcript_Bro007	it should be the	no
17021	transcript	transcript_Bro007	the problem with the error - channel error or	no
17022	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Oh that's probably the -	no
17023	transcript	transcript_Bro007	this is probably channel error stuff huh? Oh this is i- right, it says right above here	no
17024	transcript	transcript_Bro007	well, you -	no
17025	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
17026	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
17027	transcript	transcript_Bro007	So recognition performance is just the top part, actually.	no
17028	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh	no
17029	transcript	transcript_Bro007	and they have - yes, split between seen databases and non-seen so basically between development and - and evaluation.	no
17030	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
17031	transcript	transcript_Bro007	And	no
17032	transcript	transcript_Bro007	right, it's presumed there's all sorts of	no
17033	transcript	transcript_Bro007	tuning that's gone on on the	no
17034	transcript	transcript_Bro007	see- what they call seen databases and	no
17035	transcript	transcript_Bro007	there won't be tuning for the uh unseen.	no
17036	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Multi-condition - multi-condition.	no
17037	transcript	transcript_Bro007	So they have - looks like they have	no
17038	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mm-hmm.	no
17039	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh	no
17040	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh	no
17041	transcript	transcript_Bro007	so they splitting up between the T_I-digits and everything else, I see.	no
17042	transcript	transcript_Bro007	So the everything else is the SpeechDat-Car, that's the	no
17043	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah, so it's not divided between languages you mean or -	no
17044	transcript	transcript_Bro007	multi- multilingual	no
17045	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Well, it is. It is, but there's also - there's these tables over here for the - for the T_I-digits and these tables over here for the car	no
17046	transcript	transcript_Bro007	it just	no
17047	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Oh yeah.	no
17048	transcript	transcript_Bro007	data which is - which is I guess all the multilingual stuff	no
17049	transcript	transcript_Bro007	and then uh there's -	no
17050	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
17051	transcript	transcript_Bro007	they also split up between multi-condition and clean only.	no
17052	transcript	transcript_Bro007	For T_I-digits.	no
17053	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yes.	no
17054	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah, actually yeah. For the T_I-digits they want to train	no
17055	transcript	transcript_Bro007	on clean	no
17056	transcript	transcript_Bro007	and on noisy	no
17057	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
17058	transcript	transcript_Bro007	and - yeah.	no
17059	transcript	transcript_Bro007	So we're doing that also, I guess.	no
17060	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh yeah.	no
17061	transcript	transcript_Bro007	But	no
17062	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh we	no
17063	transcript	transcript_Bro007	actually -	no
17064	transcript	transcript_Bro007	do we have the features? Yeah. For the clean T_I-digits but we did not test it yet.	no
17065	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh the clean training stuff.	no
17066	transcript	transcript_Bro007	O_K.	no
17067	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mmm.	no
17068	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Well anyway, sounds like there'll be a lot to do just to	no
17069	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mm-hmm.	no
17070	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yes.	no
17071	transcript	transcript_Bro007	next few days I guess they have to send it out -	no
17072	transcript	transcript_Bro007	let's see the thirty-first is uh	no
17073	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh Wednesday and I think the - it has to be there by some	no
17074	transcript	transcript_Bro007	hour	no
17075	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh European time on Wednesday so	no
17076	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Hmm-hmm.	no
17077	transcript	transcript_Bro007	We lost time uh Wednesday maybe because	no
17078	transcript	transcript_Bro007	E- excuse me?	no
17079	transcript	transcript_Bro007	that the difference in the time may be -	no
17080	transcript	transcript_Bro007	is	no
17081	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Maybe the Thursday	no
17082	transcript	transcript_Bro007	the twelfth of the night of the Thurs- thirty-one	no
17083	transcript	transcript_Bro007	is -	no
17084	transcript	transcript_Bro007	is not valid in Europe.	no
17085	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
17086	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yes, so I mean - I think we have to actually get it done Tuesday	no
17087	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Tuesday.	no
17088	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah, well.	no
17089	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Except if - if it's the thirty-one at midnight or I don't know -	no
17090	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh	no
17091	transcript	transcript_Bro007	we can	no
17092	transcript	transcript_Bro007	do some work on Wednesday morning.	no
17093	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh yeah well.	no
17094	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah, well.	no
17095	transcript	transcript_Bro007	W- i- is but is - is it midni- I thought it was actually something like five P_M	no
17096	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
17097	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
17098	transcript	transcript_Bro007	on -	no
17099	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mm-hmm.	no
17100	transcript	transcript_Bro007	was like - I thought it was five P_M or something, I didn't think it was midnight. I thought they said they wanted everything by	no
17101	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah, five P_M.	no
17102	transcript	transcript_Bro007	well, so five P_M	no
17103	transcript	transcript_Bro007	their time	no
17104	transcript	transcript_Bro007	is - is - if	no
17105	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Not five P_M, three P_M.	no
17106	transcript	transcript_Bro007	three P_M.	no
17107	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Three P_M.	no
17108	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Alright, that's six in the morning here.	no
17109	transcript	transcript_Bro007	It's d-	no
17110	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh no	no
17111	transcript	transcript_Bro007	no.	no
17112	transcript	transcript_Bro007	three - three A_- three P_M?	no
17113	transcript	transcript_Bro007	No, we are wondering about the - the - the hour	no
17114	transcript	transcript_Bro007	that we have to	no
17115	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.	no
17116	transcript	transcript_Bro007	eh I don't know if it's three P_M - it's	no
17117	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Three P_M here is in Europe midnight.	no
17118	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah, it's - it's midnight but	no
17119	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yes, yes, but I didn't think it was midnight that it was due, I thought it was due at some hour during the day like five P_M or something.	no
17120	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Oh O_K.	no
17121	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mm-hmm.	no
17122	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mm-hmm, maybe.	no
17123	transcript	transcript_Bro007	In which case	no
17124	transcript	transcript_Bro007	so I - I - uh well we should look but my assumption is that we basically have to be done Tuesday.	no
17125	transcript	transcript_Bro007	so then next Thursday we can sort of have a	no
17126	transcript	transcript_Bro007	little aftermath but then - then we'll actually have the new data which is the German and the Danish	no
17127	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
17128	transcript	transcript_Bro007	but that really will be much less work because	no
17129	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh the system will be fixed	no
17130	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
17131	transcript	transcript_Bro007	so all we'll do is	no
17132	transcript	transcript_Bro007	take whatever	no
17133	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
17134	transcript	transcript_Bro007	and uh and run it through the process. Uh we won't be changing the training on anything	no
17135	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mm-hmm.	no
17136	transcript	transcript_Bro007	so there'll be no new training, there'll just be new H_T_K runs, so that's	no
17137	transcript	transcript_Bro007	means in some sense we	no
17138	transcript	transcript_Bro007	can kind of relax from this after -	no
17139	transcript	transcript_Bro007	after Tuesday and -	no
17140	transcript	transcript_Bro007	and uh	no
17141	transcript	transcript_Bro007	maybe next meeting we can start talking a little bit about where we want to go from here uh in terms of	no
17142	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mm-hmm.	no
17143	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh the research.	no
17144	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Um	no
17145	transcript	transcript_Bro007	you know what things	no
17146	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh did you think of when you were	no
17147	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh doing this process that uh you just didn't really have time to adequately	no
17148	transcript	transcript_Bro007	work on uh	no
17149	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mm-hmm.	no
17150	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh	no
17151	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
17152	transcript	transcript_Bro007	so	no
17153	transcript	transcript_Bro007	What?	no
17154	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Oh, Stephane always has these great ideas and -	no
17155	transcript	transcript_Bro007	oh, but uh we don't have time.	no
17156	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
17157	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
17158	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
17159	transcript	transcript_Bro007	I'm not sure these are great ideas.	no
17160	transcript	transcript_Bro007	But they're ideas.	no
17161	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah?	no
17162	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
17163	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Oh, that was good. And - and uh also it's still true that uh	no
17164	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
17165	transcript	transcript_Bro007	But	no
17166	transcript	transcript_Bro007	I think it's true that - that we - we at least got fairly consistent	no
17167	transcript	transcript_Bro007	i- improved	no
17168	transcript	transcript_Bro007	results	no
17169	transcript	transcript_Bro007	by running uh the uh neural net transformation in parallel with the features rather than	no
17170	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh in sequence which was - was your suggestion and that - that - that seems to have been borne out.	no
17171	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mm-hmm.	no
17172	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mm-hmm.	no
17173	transcript	transcript_Bro007	The fact that none of these are - are - you know, enormous is - is -	no
17174	transcript	transcript_Bro007	is not	no
17175	transcript	transcript_Bro007	too surprising - most improvements aren't enormous and	no
17176	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
17177	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh some of them are	no
17178	transcript	transcript_Bro007	but uh	no
17179	transcript	transcript_Bro007	I mean you have something really really wrong	no
17180	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mm-hmm.	no
17181	transcript	transcript_Bro007	um	no
17182	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Cuz our best improvements over the years that we've gotten from	no
17183	transcript	transcript_Bro007	finding bugs, but	no
17184	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Anyway	no
17185	transcript	transcript_Bro007	O_K well I - I think - I see where we are and everybody knows what they're doing and is there - is there anything else we should talk about or - or - are we done?	no
17186	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mm-hmm.	no
17187	transcript	transcript_Bro007	I think it's O_K um.	no
17188	transcript	transcript_Bro007	We	no
17189	transcript	transcript_Bro007	so basically we will - I think we'll try to -	no
17190	transcript	transcript_Bro007	to focus on these three	no
17191	transcript	transcript_Bro007	architectures and -	no
17192	transcript	transcript_Bro007	and perhaps I was thinking also a fourth one with	no
17193	transcript	transcript_Bro007	just - just a single K_L_T because we did not really test that -	no
17194	transcript	transcript_Bro007	removing all these K_L_T's and	no
17195	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh-huh.	no
17196	transcript	transcript_Bro007	putting one single K_L_T at the end.	no
17197	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah, I mean that would be pretty	no
17198	transcript	transcript_Bro007	low maintenance to try it.	no
17199	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
17200	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh if you can fit it in.	no
17201	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mm-hmm.	yes
17202	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Oh I have - yeah I do have one other piece of information which uh	no
17203	transcript	transcript_Bro007	I should tell people outside of this group too uh	no
17204	transcript	transcript_Bro007	I don't know if we're gonna need it	no
17205	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh but	no
17206	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh Jeff up at the	no
17207	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh University of Washington	no
17208	transcript	transcript_Bro007	has uh gotten a hold of a uh uh some kind of server farm of uh	no
17209	transcript	transcript_Bro007	of ten uh uh multiprocessor uh I_B_M machines R_S six thousands	no
17210	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mm-hmm.	no
17211	transcript	transcript_Bro007	and - and uh so I think each one is four processors or something or - I don't know, eight hundred megahertz or something and	no
17212	transcript	transcript_Bro007	there's four processors in a box and there's ten boxes and there's some kind of ti- so if - you know he's got a lot of processing power	no
17213	transcript	transcript_Bro007	and um we'd have to schedule it but if we have some big jobs and we wanna -	no
17214	transcript	transcript_Bro007	wanna - wanna run them he's -	no
17215	transcript	transcript_Bro007	he's offering it.	no
17216	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mm-hmm.	no
17217	transcript	transcript_Bro007	So.	no
17218	transcript	transcript_Bro007	It's uh	no
17219	transcript	transcript_Bro007	when he was here eh uh he - he used i- not only every machine here but every machine on campus as far as I could tell, so -	no
17220	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mm-hmm.	no
17221	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh	no
17222	transcript	transcript_Bro007	again I - I don't know if we'll end up with -	no
17223	transcript	transcript_Bro007	if we're gonna be C_P_U limited on anything that we're doing in this group but - but if - if we are	no
17224	transcript	transcript_Bro007	that's an offer.	no
17225	transcript	transcript_Bro007	O_K well uh	no
17226	transcript	transcript_Bro007	you guys doing great stuff so that's - that - that's really neat and uh	no
17227	transcript	transcript_Bro007	we'll uh	no
17228	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh g- don't think we need to uh	no
17229	transcript	transcript_Bro007	um	no
17230	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Oh well the other thing I guess that I will say	no
17231	transcript	transcript_Bro007	is that uh the digits that we're gonna record momentarily	no
17232	transcript	transcript_Bro007	is starting to get - are starting to get into a pretty good size collection	no
17233	transcript	transcript_Bro007	and um in addition to the SpeechDat stuff we will have those to work with	no
17234	transcript	transcript_Bro007	really pretty soon now so that's - that's another	no
17235	transcript	transcript_Bro007	source of data.	no
17236	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Um	no
17237	transcript	transcript_Bro007	which is	no
17238	transcript	transcript_Bro007	s- under somewhat better control and that we can - we can make measurements of the room the - uh that - you know if we feel there's other measurements we don't have that we'd like to have we can make them and	no
17239	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh Dave and I were just talking about that a little while ago	no
17240	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mm-hmm.	no
17241	transcript	transcript_Bro007	so	no
17242	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh that's	no
17243	transcript	transcript_Bro007	another -	no
17244	transcript	transcript_Bro007	another possibility for this - this kind of work.	no
17245	transcript	transcript_Bro007	K, uh if nobody has anything else maybe we should go around do - do our digits -	no
17246	transcript	transcript_Bro007	do our digits duty.	no
17247	transcript	transcript_Bro007	O_K.	no

17364	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	That's a different thing.	no
17365	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	There's another - I don't know. It starts with a P_ or something. I forget the word for it,	no
17366	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oh.	no
17367	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	but it's - it's um	no
17368	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Typically when you - you're ab- r-	no
17369	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	starting around forty for most people,	no
17370	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	it starts to harden and then it's just harder for the lens to	no
17371	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oh.	no
17372	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	shift things and th- the - the	no
17373	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Uh-huh.	no
17374	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	you have to hold stuff uh uh further away to -	no
17375	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17376	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	to see it.	no
17377	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	In fact, uh m- my brother's a	no
17378	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	came up with an - an uh - a uh body age test which uh	no
17379	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	gets down to sort of only three measurements that are good enough st-	no
17380	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And one of them is - is the distance	no
17381	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Give someone a piece of paper and then they -	no
17382	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17383	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	We're - we're live by the way, so we've got a good intro here	no
17384	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oh.	no
17385	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oh. Yeah.	no
17386	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yep.	no
17387	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oh, that's	no
17388	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	No, that's O_K.	no
17389	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	yes
17390	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oh, that's	no
17391	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
17392	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	O_K. So.	no
17393	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	discussion should be very short, right?	no
17394	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	It	no
17395	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	O_K.	no
17396	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Because Jane uh is not	no
17397	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Good point.	no
17398	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And uh she'll be most interested in that.	no
17399	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Uh, she's probably	no
17400	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	just uh, I don't think we should go though an	no
17401	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	but um uh Jose and I were just talking about	no
17402	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	the uh	no
17403	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	uh, speech e- energy thing,	no
17404	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17405	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	and I uh - We didn't talk about the derivatives. But I think,	no
17406	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	you know, the - the - i-	no
17407	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	if I can -	no
17408	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	if you don't mind my - my speaking for you for a bit,	no
17409	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	um	no
17410	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Uh. Right now,	no
17411	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	but uh -	no
17412	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Um. And uh one is that uh this is all in	no
17413	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	uh	no
17414	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Um	no
17415	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	sizes. He was - he - he was taking everything over two hundred milliseconds	no
17416	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	uh, and uh he's going to vary that number and also look at moving windows, as we discussed before.	no
17417	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Um	no
17418	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And uh - and the other thing is that the - yeah doing the -	no
17419	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	subtracting off the mean and the variance in the -	no
17420	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	may not be	no
17421	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Hi. Yeah.	no
17422	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Hi Jane!	no
17423	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	We just started.	no
17424	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Could you take that mike there?	no
17425	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Are these the	no
17426	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	the means of	no
17427	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Thanks.	no
17428	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Uh B- Between -	no
17429	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	All the frames in the	no
17430	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	between -	no
17431	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	No.	no
17432	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Between -	no
17433	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	No.	no
17434	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Neither. It's uh between the pauses	no
17435	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oh.	no
17436	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And so i- i- his - his - He's making the constraint it has to be at least two hundred milliseconds.	no
17437	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oh.	no
17438	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And so you take that. And then he's -	no
17439	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	he's uh	no
17440	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	still at the frame level,	no
17441	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Right.	no
17442	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	and then - and then just uh normalizing with that larger amount.	no
17443	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	um and -	no
17444	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But one thing he was pointing out is when he - he looked at a bunch of examples in log domain, it	no
17445	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	the	no
17446	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And you can sort of	no
17447	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	putting it on the board that	no
17448	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yep.	no
17449	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	if you sort of have	no
17450	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	log-	no
17451	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah, maybe it's not log	no
17452	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	that's the	no
17453	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mmm. Yeah.	no
17454	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But you could do like a C_D_	no
17455	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Um.	no
17456	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yes, right.	no
17457	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	normally.	no
17458	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So -	no
17459	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So just some kind of a simple -	no
17460	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So what I was suggesting to him is that -	no
17461	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Actually, a	no
17462	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But, you know, uh	no
17463	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	P_D_F	no
17464	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But,	no
17465	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17466	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17467	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah, eith- eith- uh	no
17468	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Something like that where it's sort of data driven.	no
17469	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	B- Yeah, but I think	no
17470	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	u-	no
17471	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I think a good first indicator is when the - the - the researcher looks at	no
17472	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	examples of the data	no
17473	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	and can	no
17474	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	a change	no
17475	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17476	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	when the two speaker -	no
17477	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Then, that's a problem	no
17478	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	right there.	no
17479	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17480	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oh yeah.	no
17481	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So.	no
17482	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I think you should at	no
17483	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	"doing casual looking and can get the sense, """	no
17484	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oh yeah.	no
17485	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17486	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And when he's looking in the log domain he's not really seeing it.	no
17487	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So. And when he's looking in straight	no
17488	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	so that's a good place to start.	no
17489	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17490	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Um.	no
17491	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So that was - that was the discussion we just had.	no
17492	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Um.	no
17493	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	The other thing	no
17494	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Actually we ca- had a	no
17495	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	How -	no
17496	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Uh, when you did the	no
17497	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	sampling?	no
17498	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	uh	no
17499	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	the individual channels in order to do the e-	no
17500	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	uh the	no
17501	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	did you do it over	no
17502	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	just the entire - everything in the mike channels? You didn't try to find speech?	no
17503	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	No, I just took over the entire s- uh entire channel	no
17504	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	um	no
17505	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Right, O_K. So then	no
17506	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	would be largely represented by silence.	no
17507	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yep.	no
17508	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And someone who would - who would be -	no
17509	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So the normalization factor	no
17510	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah, this was quite quick and dirty, and it was just for	no
17511	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17512	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17513	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	O_K.	no
17514	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And for	no
17515	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17516	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17517	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17518	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So.	no
17519	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17520	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But that's -	no
17521	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Right. So th-	no
17522	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But, it's not -	no
17523	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17524	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Not a good measure.	no
17525	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	O_K.	no
17526	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So yeah there - there - there -	no
17527	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	There's a good chance then given that	no
17528	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	different people	no
17529	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17530	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17531	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	there - there is still a lot more to be gained from gain norm- normalization with some	no
17532	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mmm.	no
17533	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yes, absolutely.	no
17534	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	sort if -	no
17535	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	if we can figure out a way to do it.	no
17536	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17537	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Uh. But	no
17538	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	we were agreed that in addition to that	no
17539	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	uh there should be	no
17540	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	s- stuff related	no
17541	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17542	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So we didn't talk at all about uh the other derivatives, but uh again just - just looking at -	no
17543	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Uh, I think uh Liz has a very good point,	no
17544	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	that in fact it would be much more graphic just to show -	no
17545	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17546	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Well, actually, you	no
17547	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17548	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	uh for	no
17549	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	You have some histograms,	no
17550	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17551	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	um	no
17552	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	they don't look very separate.	no
17553	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	This is the - the first derivate of	no
17554	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17555	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17556	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	uh without any kind of normalization.	no
17557	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17558	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Log energy.	no
17559	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	These the-	no
17560	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Sorry.	no
17561	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	These are the - the first experiments uh with comment uh	no
17562	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Frame energy.	no
17563	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Except that	no
17564	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	it's hard to judge this because the - they're not normalized.	no
17565	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	It's just number of frames.	no
17566	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17567	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17568	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17569	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17570	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But yeah, even so.	no
17571	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	W-	no
17572	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I mean, what I meant is, even if you use	no
17573	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	"""Number"" -"	no
17574	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	measures, like	no
17575	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	maybe	no
17576	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	we shouldn't make any assumptions about the distribution's	no
17577	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	and just use -	no
17578	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	you know, use the distribution to model the -	no
17579	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	the mean, or what- y-	no
17580	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	you know, rather than the mean take some -	no
17581	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah. But - And so in - in	no
17582	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17583	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	that.	no
17584	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	He's got some pictures.	no
17585	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17586	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But he doesn't - he doesn't in the -	no
17587	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	he- i-	no
17588	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17589	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	but not in the -	no
17590	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oh.	no
17591	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	but he d-	no
17592	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Right. So, we don't	no
17593	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	but he doesn't -	no
17594	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	doesn't -	no
17595	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But he didn't h- have it for the energy.	no
17596	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	For the raw.	no
17597	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	He had it for the derivatives.	no
17598	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17599	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So.	no
17600	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17601	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I mean, there might be something there. I don't know.	no
17602	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Huh.	no
17603	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17604	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Interesting	no
17605	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Here I - I	no
17606	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oh that - yeah that's a good q-	no
17607	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	in -	no
17608	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	did - did you have this sort of thing, for just the -	no
17609	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	just the l-	no
17610	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	r- uh the -	no
17611	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	the	no
17612	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	unnormalized	no
17613	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	No	no
17614	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	log energy?	no
17615	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I - I - I haven't	no
17616	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	O_K. Yeah. So she - she's right. That's a -	no
17617	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	but it's the - it's the - the - the following.	no
17618	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Well it might be just good to know what it looks like.	no
17619	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Cuz -	no
17620	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah. That's -	no
17621	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Huh?	no
17622	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	That's uh	no
17623	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17624	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	uh,	no
17625	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	looking at the distribution,	no
17626	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I - I - I - I mean the - the - the scatter plot	no
17627	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	combination of two,	no
17628	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah, but - but what she's saying	no
17629	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	is, which is right, is	no
17630	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I mean, let's start with the - Before we get complicated,	no
17631	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	let's start with the	no
17632	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	which is	no
17633	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	that if you take energy -	no
17634	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	uh if you	no
17635	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	that, when two people are speaking at the same time, usually	no
17636	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	there'll be	no
17637	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17638	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	That's - that sort of hypothesis. And the first way you'd look at that,	no
17639	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	That's right.	no
17640	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	uh s-	no
17641	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	she's, you know, absolutely right, is that you would	no
17642	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	just take a look at the	no
17643	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17644	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	You know, but just - but just -	no
17645	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17646	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Well in this case you have	no
17647	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	You have the	no
17648	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17649	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So,	no
17650	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	uh with three colors or three shades or whatever,	no
17651	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	just - just look at those distributions.	no
17652	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17653	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And then, given that as a base, you can see if that gets improved,	no
17654	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	you know, or - or -	no
17655	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	looking at	no
17656	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	looking at	no
17657	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	you know, it's harder to	no
17658	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17659	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	um	no
17660	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	and uh	no
17661	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	also these different normalizations,	no
17662	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But I had maybe made it too	no
17663	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	by suggesting	no
17664	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	early on, that you look at	no
17665	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17666	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Let's start off just in	no
17667	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17668	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	uh, with this	no
17669	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17670	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I think that's probably the most basic thing, before anything very	no
17671	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17672	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17673	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Um	no
17674	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And then we- w- I think we're agreed that	no
17675	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I agree, yeah.	no
17676	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Uh-huh.	no
17677	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	to	no
17678	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Um	no
17679	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	O_K.	no
17680	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But	no
17681	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	since -	no
17682	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	uh	no
17683	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	from looking at some of the	no
17684	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	is that when you looked at the regular energy,	no
17685	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	that it	no
17686	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17687	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17688	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah, yeah, yeah.	no
17689	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	that's - eh	no
17690	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	you know, you should be able to come up with a measure which will	no
17691	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And she's right,	no
17692	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	that a -	no
17693	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	that having a -	no
17694	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But -	no
17695	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	having -	no
17696	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	having this	no
17697	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Uh-huh.	no
17698	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	it's - it's -	no
17699	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	it's	no
17700	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17701	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But -	no
17702	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	the same kind of picture you have here.	no
17703	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	It - it's curious but uh I f- I found it in the - in the mixed file,	no
17704	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	in one channel	no
17705	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	talking alone	no
17706	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
17707	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	with a high level of energy	no
17708	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
17709	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	eh	no
17710	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	in the middle eh a zone of overlapping	no
17711	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
17712	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	with	no
17713	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	mmm less energy	no
17714	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	and	no
17715	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	eh	no
17716	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
17717	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	overlapping zone	no
17718	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	has	no
17719	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	eh less energy.	no
17720	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17721	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So there'll be some cases for which -	no
17722	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Because there	no
17723	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Right.	no
17724	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But, the qu- So -	no
17725	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So they'll be -	no
17726	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	This is -	no
17727	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I w- want to	no
17728	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But I mean they - there'll be time -	no
17729	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	There'll be overlap	no
17730	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	between the distributions,	no
17731	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	but the question is,	no
17732	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17733	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	"""If it's a"	no
17734	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	there's	no
17735	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17736	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Especially	no
17737	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	locally.	no
17738	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So.	no
17739	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
17740	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And -	no
17741	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Sorry.	no
17742	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I was just going to say that - that	no
17743	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	right now we're just	no
17744	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	What you would imagine	no
17745	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17746	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	discriminative system.	no
17747	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17748	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17749	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And so even if - if one of the features	no
17750	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	does a good job at	no
17751	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17752	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17753	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah, this is the -	no
17754	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Right. I mean the -	no
17755	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	the reason I had suggested the scatter f- p- features is I used to do this a lot,	no
17756	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	when we had	no
17757	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	thirteen or fifteen or twenty features	no
17758	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	um	no
17759	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Because something is a	no
17760	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	uh by itself,	no
17761	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	you don't really know how it'll behave in combination and so it's nice to have as many -	no
17762	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	as many together at the same time as possible	no
17763	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	in uh in some reasonable visual form. There's cool graphic things people have had sometimes to put together three or four in some funny -	no
17764	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	funny way.	no
17765	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But it's true	no
17766	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	that you	no
17767	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	that	no
17768	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	the	no
17769	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17770	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	have some uh -	no
17771	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Well,	no
17772	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	some hope	no
17773	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
17774	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	it's	no
17775	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
17776	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And it may not be the same	no
17777	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	for all the types of overlaps or	no
17778	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	the windows may not be	no
17779	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	the same.	no
17780	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	right now	no
17781	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	you're taking a -	no
17782	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	from the whole meeting,	no
17783	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	and you're trying to find points of overlap,	no
17784	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	but we don't really know which speaker is overlapping with which speaker, right?	no
17785	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Right.	no
17786	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17787	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So I mean another way would just be to take	no
17788	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	the speech from	no
17789	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And	no
17790	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	like -	no
17791	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	but by hand, by cheating,	no
17792	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	and looking at	no
17793	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	you know, if you can detect something	no
17794	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	No prayer.	no
17795	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	good way that we're going to be able to do it.	no
17796	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	That - You know, there might be something	no
17797	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17798	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
17799	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	has more elegant -	no
17800	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	e-	no
17801	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	The m- the right model will be	no
17802	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So if - I don't know, if you go through and you find	no
17803	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17804	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	sort of look at those	no
17805	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17806	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	and just look at the	no
17807	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17808	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Uh-huh.	no
17809	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	pattern but we just can't	no
17810	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	see it because there's too many	no
17811	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	combinations of - of people	no
17812	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17813	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	that can overlap.	no
17814	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I had the same intuition last - last - last week.	no
17815	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So.	no
17816	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17817	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Just seems sort of complex.	no
17818	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I think it's - to start with it's s-	no
17819	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	your - your idea of simplifying,	no
17820	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	starting with something that	no
17821	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	the	no
17822	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	extra	no
17823	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	layers of -	no
17824	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Right.	no
17825	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Cuz if energy doesn't matter	no
17826	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I don't think this is true, but what if	no
17827	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Sorry, what?	no
17828	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Hmm?	no
17829	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	To study individual?	no
17830	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Well, you - you - you don't have to study	no
17831	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	The - the - the -	no
17832	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Well, to study the simplest case	no
17833	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But -	no
17834	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	just simple case and	no
17835	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	to get rid of extra -	no
17836	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Consider -	no
17837	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	the one that has the lot of data associated with it.	no
17838	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Right.	no
17839	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Cuz what if it's the case and I don't think this is true -	no
17840	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	That was a	no
17841	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	What if it's the case that when two people overlap they equate their -	no
17842	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	you know, there's a	no
17843	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Or - or what if what if the equipment -	no
17844	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Or they get louder.	no
17845	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	what if the	no
17846	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	there's some	no
17847	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	equalizing in there?	no
17848	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah	no
17849	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	or -	no
17850	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Uh,	no
17851	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I mean.	no
17852	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	no we	no
17853	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But.	no
17854	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Well, but -	no
17855	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	O_K.	no
17856	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But I think that's what I was	no
17857	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	different types of	no
17858	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Saturation.	no
17859	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	There are - there are different	no
17860	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	types,	no
17861	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	and	no
17862	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	like as	no
17863	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	meaning the kind that's	no
17864	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17865	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And it	no
17866	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Um, but,	no
17867	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	some of	no
17868	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17869	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So.	no
17870	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	It -	no
17871	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Actually the s- new student, Don, who um Adam has met, and he was	no
17872	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	at one of our meetings - He's	no
17873	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	getting his feet wet and then he'll be starting again	no
17874	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I don't know if he's talked with you yet.	no
17875	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17876	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But in sort of honing in on these different types and -	no
17877	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I don't consi-	no
17878	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Now I don't consider that possibility.	no
17879	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	This is a s- a general studio of the overlapping	no
17880	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So maybe -	no
17881	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17882	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	we're studying the -	no
17883	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So it might be something that we can	no
17884	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Well	no
17885	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	i-	no
17886	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I -	no
17887	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I - I would s-	no
17888	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	you know, look at that.	no
17889	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	actually	no
17890	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	because	no
17891	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	He could - You see, he already has all his stuff in place, he has the histogram mechanism,	no
17892	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17893	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	he has the stuff that subtracts out -	no
17894	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	and all he has to do	no
17895	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	is change it uh	no
17896	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	uh from - from log to plain energy	no
17897	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	and plot the histogram	no
17898	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	and	no
17899	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And	no
17900	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17901	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	bec-	no
17902	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	but -	no
17903	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah, no. I	no
17904	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But this will -	no
17905	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	that -	no
17906	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	for	no
17907	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	if Don and I are trying to get	no
17908	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
17909	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
17910	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So you don't have to worry about it. And here's the three types of overlaps. And we'll - we'll do the	no
17911	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17912	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17913	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Hm-	no
17914	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Um.	no
17915	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Consider different class of overlap?	no
17916	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah, that we would be working on	no
17917	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17918	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Then maybe	no
17919	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17920	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	This is the thing I - I comment with you before,	no
17921	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	that uh we have a great variation of th- situation of overlapping.	no
17922	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
17923	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And the behavior for energy is,	no
17924	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	uh log energy,	no
17925	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	is not uh the same all the time.	no
17926	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
17927	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And -	no
17928	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But I guess I was just saying that - that right now	no
17929	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	uh	no
17930	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	from the	no
17931	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I don't have	no
17932	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	of whether	no
17933	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	even,	no
17934	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	you know, there are	no
17935	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17936	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	some -	no
17937	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	you know, there should be -	no
17938	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	The distributions	no
17939	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	should be	no
17940	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Uh and	no
17941	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I - I would still guess that if they are not separated at	no
17942	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17943	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	that there's some -	no
17944	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	there's - there's most likely something wrong in the way that we're measuring it.	no
17945	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17946	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17947	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Um,	no
17948	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	but	no
17949	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	um	no
17950	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	For instance, I mean I wouldn't expect that it was very	no
17951	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	when two people were talking at the same time,	no
17952	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	that it would - that it really was	no
17953	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17954	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17955	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah, no, that was - That was a jok-	no
17956	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So.	no
17957	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So.	no
17958	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	or a sort of,	no
17959	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17960	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	a case where - where you would	no
17961	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I mean. No. It could - it probably	no
17962	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17963	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	go and look at	no
17964	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Right.	no
17965	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17966	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17967	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	two individuals. So.	no
17968	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17969	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mind if I turned that light off? The flickering is annoying me.	no
17970	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	O_K.	no
17971	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	It	no
17972	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Because in back-	no
17973	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
17974	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	"And sometimes it's a nod and sometimes it's an ""mm-hmm"". And the"	no
17975	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17976	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17977	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So maybe those don't actually have much difference in energy. But	no
17978	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	and the backchannels are sort of easy to spot	no
17979	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	s- in terms of their words or - I mean, just listen to it. So.	no
17980	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17981	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But -	no
17982	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	and - and again what they - what difference there	no
17983	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	so,	no
17984	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Well, it would be lost	no
17985	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17986	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mmm,	no
17987	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	no, if it's -	no
17988	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	if i-	no
17989	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	if it's -	no
17990	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Tone	no
17991	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Well, it	no
17992	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I mean, even if you take the	no
17993	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17994	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Sure, but	no
17995	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	"Yeah, you're ""mm-hmm"" tone is going to be very different."	no
17996	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
17997	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Right.	no
17998	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Right.	no
17999	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	You could imagine doing	no
18000	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	if you could - if you had a good model for it.	no
18001	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	"Your ""mm-hmm"" detector."	no
18002	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	If - if you're - a-	no
18003	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I guess my point is, if you're doing essentially a linear separation, taking the log first	no
18004	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Right.	no
18005	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
18006	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So it's -	no
18007	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So, uh if you i- i-	no
18008	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So i- if there - if there close to things it does	no
18009	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
18010	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	it's a	no
18011	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And right now we're essentially doing this linear thing by looking across here and - and saying we're going to cut it here.	no
18012	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Um	no
18013	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	and that - that's the indicator that we're getting.	no
18014	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But	no
18015	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	but uh uh I think that -	no
18016	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	This often happens, you do fairly complicated things,	no
18017	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	and then you stand back from them and you realize that you haven't done something simple.	no
18018	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So	no
18019	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	uh, if you generated something like that just for the energy and see,	no
18020	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	and then, a- a- a- as - as Liz says, when they g- have uh uh smaller um, more coherent groups to look at, that would be another interesting thing later.	no
18021	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Uh-huh.	no
18022	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Uh-huh.	no
18023	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And then that should give us some indication -	no
18024	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And then you can move on to the uh	no
18025	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	uh more	no
18026	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
18027	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I - I - I think this is a good idea.	no
18028	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	O_K.	no
18029	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
18030	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	energy.	no
18031	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
18032	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But then the -	no
18033	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Have you started looking at the pitch related	no
18034	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	The - ?	no
18035	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Pitch	no
18036	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Harmonicity and so on?	no
18037	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I - I'm preparing the - the program but I don't - I don't begin	no
18038	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Preparing to -	no
18039	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	because eh	no
18040	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
18041	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I saw your email and	no
18042	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
18043	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	it's better to -	no
18044	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I suppose it's better to - to consider the - the energy this kind of parameter	no
18045	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oh, that's	no
18046	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	bef-	no
18047	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	No, no. I - I - I -	no
18048	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I - Well,	no
18049	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	we	no
18050	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I think that the harm-	no
18051	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I	no
18052	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	harmonicity and pitch related things I was just saying	no
18053	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I - I go on with the - with the	no
18054	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	pitch, aha!	no
18055	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah, I was just saying -	no
18056	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I - I - I - I understood uh that eh	no
18057	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	and - and concentrate my - my energy in that problem.	no
18058	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	O_K. O_K.	no
18059	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	O_K. But I think, like, all these derivatives and second derivatives and all these other very fancy things, I think I would just sort of	no
18060	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	get into the	no
18061	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	O_K. I go on	no
18062	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	a suggestion.	no
18063	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	with the pitch.	no
18064	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Uh	no
18065	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	O_K. So maybe uh	no
18066	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	since w- we're trying to	no
18067	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	uh compress the meeting,	no
18068	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	um, I know	no
18069	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	and did you have some?	yes
18070	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I wanted to ask just s- something on the end of	no
18071	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	when I presented my results about the uh distribution of overlaps and the speakers and the profiles of the speakers,	no
18072	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Uh-huh.	no
18073	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	at the bottom of that I	no
18074	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	just with reference to speaker style so,	no
18075	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oh.	no
18076	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	you know, with reference - and you know I said that on my - in my	no
18077	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	That'd be great.	no
18078	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah, I remem- Right.	no
18079	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	but that in itself is not	no
18080	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
18081	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So,	no
18082	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	but it you know it's like	no
18083	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Hmm.	no
18084	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	it sounds like you also have uh something in that	no
18085	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Is - is it -	no
18086	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	We have nothing - You know, basically, we got	no
18087	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	you know. So.	no
18088	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	It's mostly that,	no
18089	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	but if -	no
18090	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	it would be much better if	no
18091	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	you know, I - I'm not -	no
18092	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Interesting.	no
18093	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I don't	no
18094	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	go into that if I didn't have to. So if -	no
18095	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	If you're w- willing to do that or - or -	no
18096	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Well maybe we can O_K.	no
18097	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	It would be interesting, though, to talk, maybe not at the meeting,	no
18098	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
18099	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	but at some other time about what are the classes.	no
18100	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
18101	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
18102	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
18103	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
18104	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I think	no
18105	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah, it would be interesting.	no
18106	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	because you can	no
18107	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
18108	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	It seems like we also s- with reference to a purpose, too, that we we'd want to have them coded.	no
18109	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I would think it's interesting, yeah.	no
18110	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	You know, it's	no
18111	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
18112	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	That'd be	no
18113	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
18114	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yep.	no
18115	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	That'd be	no
18116	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	O_K.	no
18117	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I can do that.	no
18118	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	uh- uh-	no
18119	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	for this project, like probably,	no
18120	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	if we had to hire some - like an undergrad, because uh Don is being	no
18121	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	hhh.	no
18122	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	covered half time on something else -	no
18123	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
18124	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I mean,	no
18125	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	he - we're not paying him	no
18126	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	R_A-ship for -	no
18127	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	um	no
18128	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	If we got it to where we wanted - we needed someone to do that - I don't think there's really enough	no
18129	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
18130	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah, I see this as a prototype,	no
18131	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
18132	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	to use the only the -	no
18133	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
18134	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	the already transcribed meeting as just a prototype.	no
18135	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I - I think a- a- another	no
18136	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	parameter we c- we -	no
18137	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But -	no
18138	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	we can consider is eh the	no
18139	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
18140	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Another e- e- m-	no
18141	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	besides eh the - the class of overlap,	no
18142	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	the duration.	no
18143	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Because is possible	no
18144	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	some classes eh has eh	no
18145	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	a type of a duration, eh,	no
18146	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
18147	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	uh when we have -	no
18148	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah, definitely.	no
18149	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah, maybe -	no
18150	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	It may be	no
18151	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Is possible	no
18152	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
18153	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	to have.	no
18154	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And it's interesting,	no
18155	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Eh	no
18156	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	overlap, eh	no
18157	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	backchannel overlap,	no
18158	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	with a short duration,	no
18159	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	is possible	no
18160	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	that if we normalize eh with eh	no
18161	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	eh consider only the - the eh window	no
18162	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	eh by the left eh ri- eh	no
18163	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	side on the right side	no
18164	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	overlapping with a - a very	no
18165	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	eh the - if the fit of normalization is eh	no
18166	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	mmm	no
18167	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	bigger	no
18168	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	eh in that overlapping zone eh very short	no
18169	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
18170	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah, that's true. The window shouldn't be	no
18171	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I - I me-	no
18172	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I - I understand.	no
18173	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I mean that you have	no
18174	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
18175	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	eh you have a backchannel, eh, eh - you have a overlapping zone	no
18176	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	very short	no
18177	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	and you consider	no
18178	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	eh n- eh	no
18179	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	all the channel	no
18180	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	to normalize	no
18181	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
18182	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	this very short eh -	no
18183	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
18184	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	"for example ""mmm mm-hmm hmm"""	no
18185	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	eh	no
18186	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And the energy is not eh height	no
18187	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	eh I think if you consider all the channel	no
18188	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	to normalize and the channel is	no
18189	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	bigger	no
18190	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
18191	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	eh eh eh	no
18192	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	compared with the - with the overlapping	no
18193	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	eh duration,	no
18194	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	is	no
18195	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	mmm	no
18196	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	eh	no
18197	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	that	no
18198	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I - I mean the - the e- effect of the normalization	no
18199	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	eh with the mean and the - and the variance	no
18200	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
18201	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	eh is different that if you consider	no
18202	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	compared	no
18203	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	eh with the n- the duration of overlapping.	no
18204	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	You - you want it	no
18205	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
18206	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
18207	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
18208	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
18209	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	but uh	no
18210	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I - I don't know. Is - s-	no
18211	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
18212	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Well it's a	no
18213	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	If -	no
18214	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
18215	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
18216	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	in the center of the overlapped	no
18217	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
18218	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	you know, there'd better be some-	no
18219	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah,	no
18220	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	This is the -	no
18221	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	of the backchannel won't - won't effect anything. But you -	no
18222	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	This is the - the idea,	no
18223	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah. So.	no
18224	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	near - near -	no
18225	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	near the - the overlapping zone.	no
18226	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	You know, you shouldn't be more than	no
18227	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	like -	no
18228	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	as your	no
18229	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
18230	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
18231	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Then you're gonna w- have a wash.	no
18232	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And hopefully it's more like	no
18233	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I'm not sure that's	no
18234	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	on the order of -	no
18235	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah?	no
18236	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	It	no
18237	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yea-	no
18238	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Because -	no
18239	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
18240	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	because it -	no
18241	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	because	no
18242	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
18243	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	um	no
18244	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	again if you're just	no
18245	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	you know, the fact that this - this gain thing was crude,	no
18246	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	and the gain wh-	no
18247	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	if someone is speaking relatively	no
18248	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	at consistent	no
18249	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	just to - to give a - an extreme example,	no
18250	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	all you're doing is compensating for that.	no
18251	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And	no
18252	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And then if you look at the frame with	no
18253	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	it still should - should uh	no
18254	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah, it	no
18255	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
18256	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	It's possible to try it both ways, isn't it?	no
18257	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Well, I mean we're also talking about	no
18258	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	in this small	no
18259	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	a couple of different things. I mean, one is your	no
18260	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah I was talking about the n- normalization window.	no
18261	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And the -	no
18262	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And they could be quite different.	no
18263	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
18264	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
18265	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Right.	no
18266	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	This was sort of where -	no
18267	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah. That's true.	no
18268	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yep.	no
18269	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	where we were	no
18270	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
18271	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But, anyway	no
18272	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	We - we'll have to look at some core things.	no
18273	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Um.	no
18274	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	O_K.	no
18275	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	O_K.	no
18276	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But that'd be great if - if you're marking those and -	no
18277	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Great.	no
18278	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	O_K.	no
18279	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	um.	no
18280	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
18281	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But	no
18282	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	it	no
18283	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
18284	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	and I was assuming	no
18285	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yep, I agree.	no
18286	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	if you have the words and they're roughly aligned in time	no
18287	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
18288	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	via	no
18289	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	forced alignment or whatever we end up using,	no
18290	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	then	no
18291	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	you know, this	no
18292	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	marks and classifying all the frames inside those as whatever labels	no
18293	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Coming off of the other -	no
18294	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
18295	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Good. So, it wouldn't be	no
18296	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Jane gave	no
18297	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I wasn't planning to label the time marks.	no
18298	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I can give you	no
18299	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I was thinking that that would come from the engineering side, yeah.	no
18300	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	my	no
18301	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I don't think you	no
18302	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah. That should be linked to the words which are linked to time somehow, right?	no
18303	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	There you go.	no
18304	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Well we're not any time	no
18305	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Not now.	no
18306	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
18307	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Um	no
18308	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	If it's not hand-marked then we're not going to get the times.	no
18309	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Well, it's something that w-	no
18310	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Well, we - we wouldn't be able to do	no
18311	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yes	no
18312	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	once he gets going we're gonna	no
18313	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	hafta come up with one and	no
18314	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yes.	no
18315	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
18316	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I mean w- I guess we could do a very	no
18317	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Good.	no
18318	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So whatever you would label would be	no
18319	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Good.	no
18320	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	attached to the words, I think.	no
18321	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Great!	no
18322	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Good, good. Mm-hmm.	no
18323	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
18324	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Well again for the close	no
18325	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	stuff,	no
18326	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	That might be good enough.	no
18327	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	we could come up -	no
18328	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	take a s-	no
18329	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	take the Switchboard	no
18330	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	system or something, and -	no
18331	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
18332	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Um	no
18333	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	It'd be worth a try. It would be interesting to see what we get.	no
18334	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Just, you know, low-pass filter the speech and -	no
18335	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Cuz there's - there's a lot of work you can't do	no
18336	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	how - how would you -	no
18337	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
18338	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	You'd have to go in and measure every	no
18339	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	start and stop point	no
18340	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	next to a word	no
18341	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	is y- if you're interested in anything to do with words. So.	no
18342	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yep.	no
18343	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	It would be	no
18344	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
18345	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
18346	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Anyway	no
18347	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Good. O_K.	no
18348	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
18349	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	There's something we should	no
18350	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	talk about later but	no
18351	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	maybe not just now.	no
18352	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But, uh,	no
18353	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	should talk about our options as far as the uh	no
18354	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	uh	no
18355	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	transcription	no
18356	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yep, if I_B_M doesn't -	no
18357	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But. Well, w-	no
18358	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	O_K. Good.	no
18359	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But	no
18360	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Do we hafta	no
18361	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	we'll do that	no
18362	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Are we supposed to keep recording here?	no
18363	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah. Let's do that later.	no
18364	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah	no
18365	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
18366	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	We'll talk about it later.	no
18367	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
18368	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So	no
18369	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	uh	no
18370	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	"Uh ""forms""."	no
18371	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Forms	no
18372	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Next iteration of forms.	no
18373	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oops.	no
18374	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oh! Oh	no

18378	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Nope.	no
18379	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	One's a digit form, one's a speaker form.	no
18380	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oh!	no
18381	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So one is a one time only	no
18382	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oh,	no

18386	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Alright.	no
18387	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	This is just the suggestion for uh what the new forms would look like.	no
18388	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So, they incorporate the changes	no
18389	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Date and time.	no
18390	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Uh why did you switch the order of the Date and Time fields?	no
18391	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	This is rather a low-level, but	no
18392	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	On which one?	no
18393	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	On - on the	no
18394	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	but	no
18395	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oh you mean on the	no
18396	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	This is -	no
18397	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	this is rather a low level question, but -	no
18398	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Uh, because	no
18399	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	but it	no
18400	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	the user fills out the first three fields and I fill out the rest.	no
18401	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oh	no
18402	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Well,	no
18403	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So it	no

18405	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Because the	no
18406	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	and, excuse me, the	no
18407	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	but I'm filling out the	no
18408	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	that you're going to fill out when you read the digits?	no
18409	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
18410	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	you'll see I've already filled in the	no
18411	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So the	no
18412	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah, me too.	no
18413	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	time of the meeting.	no

18420	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oh!	no
18421	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	will know where to look in the meeting,	no
18422	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oh dear. We've been -	no
18423	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But -	no
18424	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	to try to find the digits.	no
18425	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	we've been	no
18426	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I	no
18427	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I am put - I am putting the beginning of the meeting.	no
18428	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	"So you should call it, like, ""digits start time"". Or."	no
18429	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And I haven't said anything.	no
18430	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yep.	no
18431	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Why - What - what were you putting in?	no
18432	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oh, well, I was saying if we started the meeting at	no
18433	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no

18441	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Actually it's about one third each. About one third of them are blank,	no
18442	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oh.	no
18443	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So.	no
18444	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	This would be a	no

18446	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Nah.	no
18447	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Ei- either that or maybe you could	no
18448	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
18449	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	maybe write down when people	no
18450	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	start reading digits on that	no
18451	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But if I'm not at the meeting, I can't do that.	no
18452	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah, he's been setting stuff up and going away. So.	no
18453	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	For some reason he doesn't want to sit through every meeting that's -	no
18454	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yep, but that is the reason Name, Email and Time are where they are.	no
18455	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oh, O_K. Alright.	no
18456	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
18457	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I rest my -	no

18468	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Well that	no
18469	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Why doesn't it come in at the point of Date and Seat?	no
18470	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oh.	no
18471	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	What?	no
18472	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Because we're filling in	no

18477	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	and the s-	no
18478	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	What - which form are you talking about?	no
18479	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Well I'm comparing the	no
18480	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	This is the digit form.	no
18481	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oh.	no
18482	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oh you're talking about the	no
18483	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
18484	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Digit.	no
18485	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Digit form.	no
18486	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oh! I wasn't supposed to -	no
18487	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
18488	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Sorry.	no

18498	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Alright s- but I didn't mean to derail our discussion here, so you really wanted to start with this other form.	no
18499	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	No, either way is fine I just -	no
18500	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	You just started	no
18501	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Alright yeah, I was comparing - so th- this is -	no
18502	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So I was looking at the	no
18503	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	wi-	no
18504	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Now the f- the fields	no
18505	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	are	no
18506	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So the main thing that the person fills out	no
18507	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	um	no
18508	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
18509	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	time?	no

19212	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oh.	no
19213	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	They said that the only reason they hadn't had the multi- the parallel	no

19432	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	status on	no
19433	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	discussion	no
19434	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Stuff.	no
19435	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and then uh Jose	no
19436	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	uh, the one among us who's actually doing a bunch of things on this	no
19437	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	He has	no
19438	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	have something to discuss	no
19439	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
19440	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	um	no
19441	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and	no
19442	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	um	no
19443	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	We just sent in that uh	no
19444	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	N_S_F pre-proposal but I don't think there's much to say about that except	no
19445	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	we've sent it in and	no
19446	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	we'll see what happens	no
19447	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	um	no
19448	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Anybody? Anything?	no
19449	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Anything else	no
19450	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	That's it.	no
19451	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So	no
19452	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Why don't we do it in that order?	yes
19453	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Why don't we do it in that order?	no
19454	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K.	no
19455	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I uh	no
19456	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So one of the things that I've been doing with the digits forms is I've been adding more and more speaker specific information to them and it's getting pretty crowded and you have to fill it out each time.	no
19457	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So, what I	no
19458	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And then, on the digits form you just have to put your name down	no
19459	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and you can look it up from the speaker form.	no
19460	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	so, I had a first pass of it,	no
19461	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and I	no
19462	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	what language and education and that sort of stuff and so I have a first pass at it.	no
19463	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And I was uh just wondering if people had any comments on information that should or shouldn't be on it.	no
19464	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And I	no
19465	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	um	no
19466	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So I'll just sort of	no
19467	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So the top of it is	no
19468	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	uh, Name, Sex	no
19469	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Email or Other Contact Information.	no
19470	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And I put the contact information just in case we have people with the same name,	no
19471	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	so that you can distinguish them,	no
19472	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and then also just to have a	no
19473	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And then, uh, we talked a little bit about whether to do -	no
19474	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	how we get at the background.	no
19475	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And we could	no
19476	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	it's	no
19477	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	that we figured what was more important	no
19478	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	was	no
19479	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	um	no
19480	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	At least that would get at	no
19481	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and it's also relevant to status.	no
19482	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I c- I can insert that.	no
19483	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And s- and relevant to status.	no
19484	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
19485	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So that	no
19486	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	uh	no
19487	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Status?	no
19488	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Which might in- af- affect the discourse aspects.	no
19489	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So, go ahead.	no
19490	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Oh - oh, stats kind of status, O_K.	no
19491	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	His - Uh-huh. Yeah.	no
19492	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So - uh, I have uh,	no
19493	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Categories.	no
19494	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	five things that you can	no
19495	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Undergrad, Grad,	no
19496	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Post-doc, Professor, and then Other, with a colon and a place where you can fill in if there's some Other.	no
19497	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So I think the	no
19498	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	who are	no
19499	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	U_S education levels.	no
19500	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and	no
19501	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	help to translate what that means.	no
19502	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	How fine a resolution do you	no
19503	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	for this?	no
19504	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I mean	no
19505	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Is the question.	no
19506	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	maybe not so	no
19507	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
19508	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Student, Non-student.	no
19509	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Oh	no
19510	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"Can you just write something like ""position""?"	no
19511	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and people can fill in their own	no
19512	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	P- prone.	no
19513	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
19514	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"""Post-doc"" or"	no
19515	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Sitting.	no
19516	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, the problem with that is	no
19517	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	um, I think the same as the problem of	no
19518	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"That it - it will be - there will be a tendency all - for everyone to put down ""speech researcher"" or -"	no
19519	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	or something at that granularity.	no
19520	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	oh.	no
19521	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So	no
19522	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I	no
19523	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	At least	no
19524	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	um	no
19525	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I think the only	no
19526	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
19527	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I think that - so	no
19528	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Uh - did - are - were you suggesting that it should be	no
19529	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	No, no.	no
19530	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Less.	no
19531	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Um,	no
19532	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Hmm	no
19533	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	um	no
19534	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	well, do you think there's -	no
19535	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I don't really know.	no
19536	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I mean, were you thinking, uh, that it	no
19537	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	would be useful for some research later	no
19538	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	to know say, you said undergrad for instance, so, undergrad versus grad, do you think that's important?	no
19539	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
19540	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
19541	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I do, and the reason is because I think that	no
19542	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K.	no
19543	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	um, well having been a grad	no
19544	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	at - at Berkeley,	no
19545	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	that, um,	no
19546	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I think there's almost like a quantum leap from undergrad to grad	no
19547	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	in terms of like the	no
19548	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	simply	no
19549	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	You know, in - in my department it was always the case grad students had a	no
19550	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	amount of different priority, and were treated as equals, g- and -	no
19551	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and help- helpers, you know, in - in	no
19552	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	research, uh	no
19553	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	uh c- uh	no
19554	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	roles and things that they -	no
19555	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	that they - In terms of like the s- the social dynamics of interactions,	no
19556	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
19557	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I would expect them to be	no
19558	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	less deferent.	no
19559	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and	no
19560	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I see.	no
19561	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	maybe	no
19562	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I don't	no
19563	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right.	no
19564	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	unless we	no
19565	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	How about -	no
19566	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	You could say, if you're giving a talk, how likely are you to be challenged?	no
19567	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	This is the	no
19568	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, this is the dimension.	no
19569	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, one of the - one of the criteria	no
19570	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah, but -	no
19571	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I had for designing this form, is that I didn't want a separate instruction sheet.	no
19572	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
19573	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And so we'll get to that in a moment when we talk about language also.	no
19574	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
19575	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Is I did	no
19576	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	uh	no
19577	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	social dynamics expert	no
19578	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	being the one who's filling out the answers. I want it to be	no
19579	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	can give it to them and they can understand what you're asking.	no
19580	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
19581	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And it's non-threatening, I mean, this - this compared to, you know,	no
19582	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yep.	no
19583	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	wh- exactly what level of professorship, and -	no
19584	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well,	no
19585	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Bas- in- in this meeting,	no
19586	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	sort of what is your social status?	no
19587	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	That's a separate question.	no
19588	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	We'll	no
19589	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well,	no
19590	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	get to that in a moment.	no
19591	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	But I - I agree that this is	no
19592	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	that w-	no
19593	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	the rea- the motivation was	no
19594	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	things that could affect social dynamics in ways that are relevant to the research	no
19595	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	without being threatening to the person.	no
19596	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	But - but - but it's gonna	no
19597	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And this	no
19598	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I	no
19599	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	is speaker -	no
19600	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	is dependent only on the speaker, not on the	no
19601	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
19602	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
19603	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	You could imagine then having	no
19604	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	that you might want to do	no
19605	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	to get out the relationships -	no
19606	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
19607	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
19608	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	But	no
19609	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So, what I	no
19610	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and they fill it out	no
19611	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and - and then you	no
19612	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	well,	no
19613	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and we - also discussed the idea of having	no
19614	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I-	no
19615	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I g-	no
19616	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	the separate D_T_	no
19617	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	maybe, s- specific - meeting-specific things that might be relevant.	no
19618	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	D_T_D?	no
19619	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	uh, the data, so that, you know, his X_M_L thing?	no
19620	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Oh.	no
19621	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	You got	no
19622	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	the Data Type Definition -	no
19623	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Oh, O_K.	no
19624	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	the Document Type Definition p- part	no
19625	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Ah.	no
19626	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
19627	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
19628	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	that it's - can s- be used for relational things, yeah.	no
19629	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	D_T_D.	no
19630	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I guess -	no
19631	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	See-	no
19632	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I guess it seems to me like you know I - trying to	no
19633	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	deduce information about the person's status	no
19634	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	from the meeting independent form	no
19635	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	one person's an undergrad and the other's a full professor is interesting.	no
19636	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So, the question is how much of this information	no
19637	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	um,	no
19638	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	But, that will	no
19639	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	can y-	no
19640	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	right? Let's say the undergrad was an expert in physics, and -	no
19641	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well,	no
19642	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	But - but you	no
19643	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right? So, if you don't have that information,	no
19644	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
19645	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	how are you gonna do	no
19646	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I guess I'm wondering	no
19647	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	yeah	no
19648	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	This is just -	no
19649	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	if you	no
19650	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, you know, we're - we're talking at - at a general level of description. You can	no
19651	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	yeah	no
19652	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And, it may be -	no
19653	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I mean, so what would you suggest?	no
19654	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	That's why I was	no
19655	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right.	no
19656	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Can you repeat the categories you had? Maybe they're fine.	no
19657	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
19658	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Undergrad, Grad, Post-doc, Professor, Other	no
19659	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So that, yeah, I think that's fine	no
19660	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	except the one	no
19661	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	thing is there are a lot of ICSI v- like I don't know what I would be here, just	no
19662	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I'm not a professor	no
19663	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"oh, that's right, you know I was saying ""Professor""."	no
19664	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So - so anything that, like a Visitor r- ICSI Visitor or, ICSI y- I mean a	no
19665	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Uh-huh.	no
19666	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Visiting S-	no
19667	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"Yeah, when I said ""Professor"", I guess what I was thinking in my mind was more"	no
19668	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Researcher or whatever.	no
19669	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"""P_H_D but not Post-doc""."	no
19670	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	How about -	no
19671	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So if -	no
19672	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah, how about	no
19673	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Post-P_H_D researcher or something	no
19674	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	if we can put something -	no
19675	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah, that - then -	no
19676	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
19677	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right?	no
19678	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	for - for that purpose	no
19679	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So, change -	no
19680	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"Would we change ""Post-doc"" to"	no
19681	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"""Post-P_H_D Researcher""?"	no
19682	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	or just -	no
19683	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Or maybe Post-doc	no
19684	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"change ""Post-doc"" to ""P_H_D""?"	no
19685	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	You could say -	no
19686	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Because I think P_H_D and Professor are d- are	no
19687	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
19688	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	distinct aren't they?	no
19689	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
19690	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Wait, what's a P_H_D?	no
19691	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	It's possible.	no
19692	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Like, if you have a P_H_D	no
19693	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Someone who has a P_H_D.	no
19694	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and you're	no
19695	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and you're not a post-doc, then that's like what we are	no
19696	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	so	no
19697	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah so for - for me there's - there's a -	no
19698	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	There's a bunch of people like that.	no
19699	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	There are people -	no
19700	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Um, this got very tricky in fact when we got involved with the	no
19701	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	actually because	no
19702	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"uh, when we said, in our original forms, ""post-doc"""	no
19703	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	what we were used to, from the German program and from the U_S standard,	no
19704	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
19705	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"when you say ""post-doc"" it meant somebody who had"	no
19706	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right.	no
19707	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	who was doing one year someplace.	no
19708	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	But when we did the	no
19709	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
19710	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"many people said ""oh I want to be"	no
19711	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"uh - have a post-doc slot"" and they were"	no
19712	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
19713	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	twenty years out	no
19714	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"because they were ""post"""	no
19715	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right.	no
19716	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
19717	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right.	no
19718	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	their	no
19719	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
19720	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So, you can say Post-P_H_D Researcher or	no
19721	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Sure.	no
19722	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I - I - I think that -	no
19723	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right.	no
19724	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	It might be hard to do a finer thing than that because whether somebody is going to be dominant in a meeting	no
19725	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	general like that.	no
19726	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	is really	no
19727	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I think it's going to be	no
19728	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	uh, could be very very	no
19729	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	uh, strongly opinionated about something and somebody who's been twenty years out	no
19730	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	could be shy, you know, s-	no
19731	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So, maybe Undergrad, Grad,	no
19732	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm. That's true.	no
19733	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
19734	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Post-P_H_D and Other?	no
19735	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	What's	no
19736	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	um, other -	no
19737	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	For the European -	no
19738	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	It's just to allow.	no
19739	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yep.	no
19740	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	If i-	no
19741	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	You- I think you could keep Professor, but you could say Post P_H_D Researcher or something.	no
19742	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	It could be st- It could be -	no
19743	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Instead of -	no
19744	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	instead of -	no
19745	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	instead of	no
19746	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	No, instead of Post - Post-doc or Post-P_H_D,	no
19747	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	just wrap all the people that are post P_H_D	no
19748	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and non-professors together.	no
19749	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	so you want Professor to be in a separate category, you think -	no
19750	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	you think uh -	no
19751	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So,	no
19752	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I think	no
19753	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	think - think we -	no
19754	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	as I said Undergrad -	no
19755	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Undergrad, Grad, Post-P_H_D, Professor, Other?	no
19756	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
19757	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, yeah the Post-P_H_D one is the one that can be, like	no
19758	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Post-	no
19759	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Post-doc or Post-P_H_D Researcher or	no
19760	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
19761	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	whatever. Yeah.	no
19762	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right.	no
19763	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Then it'd be fine.	no
19764	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So, I'm te- I'm tending to push toward simpler even though I know that	no
19765	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I think it's fine.	no
19766	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	more	no
19767	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I - uh - The - the - the thing	no
19768	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	making me lean toward simpler where possible is that	no
19769	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	uh	no
19770	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Many of the meetings that we record	no
19771	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	uh,	no
19772	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	even though	no
19773	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	uh,	no
19774	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And so the more forms we have and the more lines in the forms	no
19775	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	that's th- the more overhead for that one time thing makes it harder to do.	no
19776	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	That's true.	no
19777	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, the	no
19778	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	That -	no
19779	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right. And so I'm saying I expect us to do both kinds.	no
19780	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right.	no
19781	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I guess we could have another type of	no
19782	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
19783	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	less frequent.	no
19784	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, one thing, so you understand he -	no
19785	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	he d- he wants you to do this only once for each person?	no
19786	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yes.	no
19787	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K, O_K.	no
19788	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So I'm saying there are going to be -	no
19789	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So.	no
19790	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	What I imagine once we've collected a	no
19791	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	a chunk of it will be	no
19792	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	uh, the same people many times	no
19793	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and another chunk of it will be people -	no
19794	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
19795	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
19796	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
19797	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
19798	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	from different	no
19799	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I think.	no
19800	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well I think that if - if we're	no
19801	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	then we should probably have another set of forms.	no
19802	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K.	no
19803	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	You know, a	no
19804	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and the speaker information form and not have them do digits.	no
19805	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K.	no
19806	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	the	no
19807	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
19808	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
19809	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	interest- there can be a lot of interesting	no
19810	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I'm wondering	no
19811	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	could we	no
19812	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	that would somehow -	no
19813	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	This is a topic I want to bring up	no
19814	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
19815	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K.	no
19816	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So, that - that - that's	no
19817	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	um,	no
19818	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	with the digits forms. So, s- can we get -	no
19819	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I guess I was thinking	no
19820	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	maybe, you know how you were taking information	no
19821	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
19822	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	put one more thing on here maybe?	no
19823	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	That's what I want to talk about in a -	no
19824	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah, I'm - I have that as a topic, also.	no
19825	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K.	no
19826	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So, let's finish with the	no
19827	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Cuz you said separate forms so I thought maybe -	no
19828	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	speaker form and then we'll get over	no
19829	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K.	no
19830	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So, Education Level, Undergrad, Grad, Post-P_H_D, Professor, Other.	no
19831	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K?	no
19832	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K.	no
19833	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	um	no
19834	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"and then I put ""Optional"""	no
19835	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"with a big ""Optional"" in parentheses, Age."	no
19836	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Wait, why is that optional?	no
19837	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Because I think a lot of people are	no
19838	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
19839	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
19840	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So I don't want to make them feel like they have to.	no
19841	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I don't know.	no
19842	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	It - it would be very good to get age for a lot of purposes.	no
19843	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
19844	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I mean	no
19845	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Uh,	no
19846	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	a lot of corpora -	no
19847	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	yeah, so we ca- we have these age ranges or something?	no
19848	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Oh, right.	no
19849	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well it -	no
19850	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, wait - wait - wait - wait a minute, um,	no
19851	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	You know, like -	no
19852	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	It's not illegal or anything right, it's not pushing on anything unethical or illegal, whatever, to ask for their age, right?	no
19853	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	No, not at all, every - most corpora have that, you know,	no
19854	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So -	no
19855	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I suggest you ask for their age	no

19865	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, I think that just having on the form -	no
19866	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	saying Optional, Age,	no
19867	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	again means	no
19868	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	yeah, that's O_K.	no

20007	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	that you're saying, uh what is your -	no
20008	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
20009	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So the - the	no
20010	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	the non-na- for the native English speakers we have	no
20011	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
20012	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And that's it.	no
20013	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And that's partly to pick up - Yeah.	no
20014	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And then	no
20015	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	um, list other language influences.	no
20016	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	S- Mm-hmm	no
20017	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So what does Region mean	no
20018	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah, I was just gonna ask the same thing.	no
20019	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and like	no
20020	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	if	no
20021	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Region.	no
20022	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Region -	no
20023	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right, neither would I.	no
20024	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Do you want to have - give choices and have them circle one, or, I mean	no
20025	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, we -	no
20026	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Um,	no
20027	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Does that mean region of -	no
20028	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	When we - when we discussed it it was - it was	no
20029	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	where - where you lived during your childhood and adolescence.	no
20030	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Region of the U_S, or region of the world -	no
20031	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	If you're	no
20032	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well -	no
20033	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K.	no
20034	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	It's -	no
20035	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	but I mean.	no
20036	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	W- it's where you lived.	no
20037	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	That - that - so that's why I didn't have	no
20038	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	it would be different depending on	no
20039	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	what your language is. So -	no
20040	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Do you mean state,	no
20041	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Hmm.	no
20042	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	You mean like you know	no
20043	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	southern U_S, or northeastern or	no
20044	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	It- I think it would be however you would identify	no
20045	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	your own. And, as I said I don't really see a way of doing a	no
20046	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	there would have to be one for American English, one for British English, one for	no
20047	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
20048	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	you know, one for each type.	no
20049	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	If you wanted to get regions for American English you could copy what they did in TIMIT.	no
20050	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, and also -	no
20051	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	They had divided things up into	no
20052	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	But - but	no
20053	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	regions.	no
20054	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	for circles, if you're American English or British English or Indian English.	no
20055	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	No, no. It would only be f-	no
20056	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	if you said American English	no
20057	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	yeah maybe	no
20058	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	then you'd put the regions. For the others, you would just leave it.	no
20059	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	people to really group them	no
20060	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah. We wouldn't have enough to really make them -	no
20061	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	difference on those.	no
20062	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well -	no
20063	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and you know when you talk about dialects in England, I mean, that's really -	no
20064	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Every block of	no
20065	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Hmm.	no
20066	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	so.	no
20067	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
20068	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I haven't	no
20069	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Are you s- Do they have a bunch of options like uh -	no
20070	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Oh, it's like six regions of the country or something. Very - just a limited number and then	no
20071	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
20072	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I see.	no
20073	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K.	no
20074	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
20075	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	if you're American you would just circle	no
20076	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, that's the concept, yeah.	no
20077	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	the region	no
20078	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
20079	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah, and Henry Higgins could say which block you were from.	no
20080	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	where -	no
20081	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right? So that's -	no
20082	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
20083	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well that - you know that was the concept of having the	no
20084	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	It would be no problem to	no
20085	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah, I just don't know what to do about the other	no
20086	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	varieties of English.	no
20087	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, that's true.	no
20088	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	You'd just leave them.	no
20089	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	You don't even ask.	no
20090	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I - I - there are	no
20091	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	what	no
20092	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	you know	no
20093	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, that's why I wanted to just leave it something that you could write it down.	no
20094	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	in the others so it might be	no
20095	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	better to just do it for the	no
20096	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	yeah you could leave region for -	no
20097	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	for the others but have	no
20098	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	One - one good reason to use the	no
20099	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"you know, about the data later on you can say ""well I chose these"	no
20100	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"based on TIMIT"","	no
20101	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	That	no
20102	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right.	no
20103	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	What - what about	no
20104	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And -	no
20105	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	just doing	no
20106	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	the - the sort of the Steve suggestion,	no
20107	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	uh, as - as an add-on to it, right? Rather than saying Region,	no
20108	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	just say	no
20109	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"""Where did you live between the ages of"	no
20110	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"here and here?"""	no
20111	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And that would apply to everybody then?	no
20112	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah. And then you could	no
20113	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Just -	no
20114	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and -	no
20115	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
20116	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	It's just the	no
20117	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And then they - they could s-	no
20118	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
20119	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right - yeah, they could say it different ways.	no
20120	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
20121	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	That's more general.	no
20122	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
20123	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	That's true.	no
20124	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
20125	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Actually	no
20126	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	that	no
20127	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	levels of resolution in your survey, it - it'll be more of a pain later, so.	no
20128	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Somebody's gonna have to do some data -	no
20129	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, there could be a	no
20130	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	It	no
20131	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I guess there's a-	no
20132	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right? So, you could say	no
20133	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah, that -	no
20134	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
20135	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	First of all some people take - you-	no
20136	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	A lot of post-processing.	no
20137	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, and some people would give you more specific	no
20138	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	information than others and that's a	no
20139	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	the least common denominator of specificity and	no
20140	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah but that -	no
20141	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	but the good thing about it is it - is it frees you from coming up with exactly what the right	no
20142	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	um,	no
20143	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right?	no
20144	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I don't know later on, if - if somebody just says Midwest, now all these other people who said	no
20145	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
20146	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	you know area- then	no
20147	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	that'll have to become your category.	no
20148	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and it's -	no
20149	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	It's harder later on, i- I -	no
20150	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I see.	no
20151	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	There	no
20152	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	It's easier for the	no
20153	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	actually	no
20154	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	any minimum level of specificity.	no
20155	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	But I think that if you're going to have it be general	no
20156	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	so it's -	no
20157	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	uh, so the idea again was, you know, you might wanna	no
20158	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	if they grew up in Germany or if they grew up -	no
20159	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and so	no
20160	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	The idea - the motivation I think for this being suggested	no
20161	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	um -	no
20162	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	you know, if you say your native	no
20163	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	language was - was English but uh	no
20164	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	you grew up in Germany, uh	no
20165	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah, y- there	no
20166	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I think this -	no
20167	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	in this whole thing, which is that	no
20168	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	between certain ages isn't enough, because	no
20169	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
20170	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	somebody could grow up in Germany but live on an army base	no
20171	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
20172	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	speaking English.	no
20173	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Or their parents live - yeah.	no
20174	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah, so you sort of have to say what languages were spoken in the home between the ages of -	no
20175	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and their parents -	no
20176	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, we have this - We hafta - So. He hasn't given you the	no
20177	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	but you have, like, the	no
20178	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Other Language Influences, for example bilingual dialects, th- things like that.	no
20179	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Oh that's nice, O_K.	no
20180	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Now there's this	no
20181	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	not wa- like	no
20182	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	you don't want the forms to be hugely complicated and take half the	no
20183	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
20184	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So,	no
20185	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	it's trying to - e- there's this - trying to - trying to hold this	no
20186	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	uh, you know, not taking too much	no
20187	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
20188	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	asking in a way that they don't mind.	no
20189	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	If we	no
20190	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	if you do this free form um	no
20191	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	then you need - someone needs to enter that, and they'll be notes and it will be very difficult for somebody later actually use	no
20192	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, I think rea- I think that	no
20193	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	that without mapping it. It's O_K. But it's -	no
20194	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	we need to	no
20195	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
20196	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And in terms of the	no
20197	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	will be participating in the meeting data. We can	no
20198	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	find it - We can	no
20199	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mmm.	no
20200	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I mean, I guess what you	no
20201	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah, and the question is how	no
20202	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	extensive this gets.	no
20203	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	there's	no
20204	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
20205	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	then we should have some question where it's not free form, except for these people who are	no
20206	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	who have	no
20207	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"non-American English accents. There we probably have to have a category ""Non-American English"" and then a few choices."	no
20208	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And we should have something	no
20209	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	that's simple, that people can circle,	no
20210	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	like	no
20211	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	these TIMIT regions or something, so that we have something	no
20212	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	that minimally you can - cuz a lot of times if you give the data out that's what people are gonna use. They're gonna want some small set of	no
20213	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	places, and then, but anything additional people can fill out, and we can put it in as a note or something, but if we don't have that, someone's gotta sit there and figure out	no
20214	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	you know, I've got twenty people who said	no
20215	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Midwest, and I've got a few people who said something else and these don't overlap or these	no
20216	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well-	no
20217	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Isn't it - I mean, I think	no
20218	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	we're going a	no
20219	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	because I	no
20220	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and I think it's a question of how to ge- incorporate it,	no
20221	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and - and we've already suggested - I mean,	no
20222	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	it's come up in this discussion, that - the suggestion	no
20223	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	that	no
20224	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	we could have	no
20225	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and - and then make the choice	no
20226	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Oh, O_K, so - yeah as long as you have -	no
20227	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	as to whether we do it for British,	no
20228	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I mean, w- we sort of discussed one way or the other, and it	no
20229	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I don't know if	no
20230	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	but we could have	no
20231	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	We could even use the TIMIT subcategorization. I don't know if it has one for British, or whatever,	no
20232	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
20233	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	But you know, just have it - you know, a short simple form that you can categorize yourself	no
20234	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	in a - in a systematic way.	no
20235	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	What about	no
20236	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	the - the phrasing that	no
20237	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	um	no
20238	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Chuck used, uh	no
20239	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	in - in relation to the question I was trying to	no
20240	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	formulate of uh	no
20241	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Where -	no
20242	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	where did you - what - what was that - what w- how did you phrase it?	no
20243	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	What language was spoken in the home?	no
20244	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"""What language was spok-"", yeah, so it's not where did you grow up, but what language was spoken in the home between the ages of, what would it be, five and twelve or something like that?"	no
20245	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mmm. Yeah.	no
20246	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	It's a good idea.	no
20247	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Depends of who you	no
20248	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, in the	no
20249	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
20250	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	then it's the -	no
20251	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	the school influence as well and	no
20252	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And the peers.	no
20253	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and yeah, so	no
20254	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	That's	no
20255	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	um	no
20256	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah, so this is why I -	no
20257	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So it's - you know it starts to get sort of complicated.	no
20258	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, -	no
20259	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So - so th-	no
20260	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	It's - that's	no
20261	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	That would be a	no
20262	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	would - uh	no
20263	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"""among your peers""."	no
20264	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	You know.	no
20265	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	cuz he does make a good point about the region not necessarily again, if you're on the army base or -	no
20266	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Specify the	no
20267	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right.	no
20268	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, the way it's phrased right now,	no
20269	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
20270	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	it's clearly asking about language.	no
20271	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And so, what it's trying to get at is what you think you	no
20272	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right.	no
20273	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	the point is well	no
20274	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	But, other than having a trained	no
20275	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	interview them	no
20276	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
20277	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Because as you	no
20278	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and	no
20279	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Sort of like as soon as you get to the	no
20280	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right.	no
20281	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah, that's right.	no
20282	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
20283	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
20284	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So I want to	no
20285	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and we're -	no
20286	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	at the	no
20287	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and then we - like I said, we have the enviable benefit of	no
20288	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and being able to ask them	no
20289	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	For now, right so it's - I mean, again, we are hoping to expand this out, yeah.	no
20290	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	For now.	no
20291	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Washington and stuff,	no
20292	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	yeah.	no
20293	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So I think that adding the - the	no
20294	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	But I think we	no
20295	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	is it gonna be a	no
20296	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	or are we gonna ask them	no
20297	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"""what was it when you were"	no
20298	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	What's the best way of phrasing the question?	no
20299	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, you know the	no
20300	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	it seems like th- one of the reasons you would gather	no
20301	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	real detailed information about their	no
20302	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	native	no
20303	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and -	no
20304	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, it's -	no
20305	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And somebody	no
20306	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I don't -	no
20307	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Or adapta- or adaptation.	no
20308	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Most of -	no
20309	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well that's what I was gonna ask, is that -	no
20310	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	but most of those people don't rely on the self-evaluations, anyway. They'll probably listen to the speech, so	no
20311	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, I - you know, I w-	no
20312	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	e-	no
20313	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	that's a good point,	no
20314	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	but I was thinking uh, you know, with reference to	no
20315	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	the	no
20316	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	uh	no
20317	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and I	no
20318	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	but if you have a bunch of, say, R_less dialects and	no
20319	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	uh you know, if they -	no
20320	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	But even you know in Switchboard, I -	no
20321	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I remember looking	no
20322	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	but they had North Atlantic, Mid-Atlantic, and -	no
20323	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	You know,	no
20324	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I mean	no
20325	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	most of the people from cer- certain places in the South were	no
20326	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	from	no
20327	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	specific Texas locations, but	no
20328	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	you had a huge range of -	no
20329	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	You know, people would say Boston, and they had nothing like what I would call a Boston accent. So it was -	no
20330	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm. Interesting.	no
20331	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Were they putting down where they lived	no
20332	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Um	no
20333	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Rather than where they grew up?	no
20334	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	No, the question was really	no
20335	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
20336	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	dialect	no
20337	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mmm.	no
20338	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	region.	no
20339	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	But you have a lot of	no
20340	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and you know, for instance, you know, Minnesota Midwest is totally different than Michigan Midwest which is totally -	no
20341	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
20342	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right.	no
20343	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Interesting.	no
20344	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	it - it's sort of a general help	no
20345	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	but I think that anyone who's doing phonetics wouldn't rely on that, they would probably use it as a first pass or something,	no
20346	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So, then we probably don't	no
20347	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well maybe should we just -	no
20348	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Then maybe we shouldn't - just shouldn't	no
20349	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, I think we	no
20350	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
20351	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	but we don't need to ha- be really really specific about the others, because it won't be very w- helpful anyway.	no
20352	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
20353	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, maybe for the native	no
20354	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I think we	no
20355	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	It's sort of a political thing.	no
20356	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And there are some general - like, you will find more New Yorkers in the New York category.	no
20357	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	but it's not	no
20358	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	It	no
20359	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right.	no
20360	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	The other thing also is that I'm asking for the variety of English, and I	no
20361	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So, I didn't put Canadian, Australian, and all the other varieties.	no
20362	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
20363	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	But Other is there, and people will fill that out. They'll see by example.	no
20364	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	e-	no
20365	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	But do you think those three are O_K?	no
20366	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah, I think those are good.	no
20367	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K.	no
20368	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Canadian, or	no
20369	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
20370	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So internally, we have Texas and other.	no
20371	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Hmm.	no
20372	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So that for the Eng- native English speakers, we'll do variety of English,	no
20373	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right.	no
20374	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	regions from the TIMIT labels, and another field.	no
20375	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I mean, even like Cal- L_A is totally different than - I mean, you really can't um -	no
20376	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And then	no
20377	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well -	no
20378	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
20379	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	We could ask them for more information, but I don't think it's -	no
20380	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I	no
20381	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well that's what	no
20382	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
20383	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	the	no
20384	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	because - I mean, you have a bunch of different types of accents in	no
20385	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	You know. Native-speaking	no
20386	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Oh yeah.	no
20387	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	mm-hmm	no
20388	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	You know. There are	no
20389	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	you know,	no
20390	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	other - other aspects,	no
20391	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
20392	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	which is why we have this third category. So	no
20393	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	we wanted to	no
20394	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	certainly distinguish American versus British,	no
20395	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and other types at that level,	no
20396	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and then allow people to self-identify if there are	no
20397	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and then in	no
20398	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	with	no
20399	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	you know, in childhood and as-	no
20400	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So if you lis-	no
20401	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	if - if you - You know. So,	no
20402	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Air conditioning.	no
20403	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"""Where did you live?"" I mean. What"	no
20404	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	you know,	no
20405	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"""where - where - wh- where did you live?"", or"	no
20406	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"uh, what you were saying, ""Languages in the home""."	no
20407	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	But I think that	no
20408	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	uh a time frame on the region would be useful instead of	no
20409	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	It's a little bit	no
20410	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	um	no
20411	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	so	no
20412	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	well, you know, there's this issue of -	no
20413	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	of what age is	no
20414	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well you could distinguish between pre-five and five t- five to twelve, right? So depending on what someone's interest was in the formation of the phonetic kinds of	no
20415	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	linguistic speech patterns, you know	no
20416	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Oh,	no
20417	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	uh	no
20418	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	so	no
20419	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	But, again,	no
20420	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	it depends how fine we wanna get, but we could say uh	no
20421	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"""where did you live before you were five?"", ""where did you live after you were five?"","	no
20422	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Oh that's	no
20423	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	from five to -	no
20424	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	yeah	no
20425	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	fifteen or something,	no
20426	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	is a -	no
20427	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I mean, I think the question on regions is really	no
20428	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	to ask people	no
20429	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	how did they define their dialect region now, di- the- whether they picked it up	no
20430	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	at - the - one age or another.	no
20431	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	pretty much, I mean, most people will	no
20432	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	accent or not.	no
20433	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
20434	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	um, but they may	no
20435	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	you know, in other places, too. So if we ask the question about dialect regions, it makes	no
20436	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right.	no
20437	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right?	no
20438	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right.	no
20439	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	You ask how would you best define your	no
20440	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	your accent or your dialect style.	no
20441	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right, the way - the way the form reads	no
20442	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K	no
20443	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
20444	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And then we'll have	no
20445	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	whatever the TIMIT categories are. So I think	no
20446	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	i- if you	no
20447	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Or you could say to somebody,	no
20448	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	that you have.	no
20449	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right.	no
20450	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	um	no
20451	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And then you can ask these other questions as well, but what we don't want them to think is that they're living in a certain place	no
20452	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and that therefore they're - I mean, nowadays	no
20453	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right.	no
20454	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	from California	no
20455	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
20456	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well I - I g-	no
20457	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K.	no
20458	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I don't think it was	no
20459	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right, so I - it seems to me that	no
20460	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K, as long as it's clear.	no
20461	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	It's -	no
20462	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	It's a sub-categorization.	no
20463	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	i- w- it's pretty obvious that it's a subcategory of the	no
20464	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
20465	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
20466	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K.	no
20467	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K.	no
20468	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	on the	no
20469	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So it's just in the	no
20470	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K.	no
20471	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K.	no
20472	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Why don't we try it out.	no
20473	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and see -	no
20474	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
20475	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah,	no
20476	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"And then uh, as Jane said, the last question is ""List other language influences, bilingual dialects, et cetera."" And that's just and open-ended"	no
20477	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Oh. Mm-hmm.	no
20478	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	place for them to	no
20479	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Sounds good.	no
20480	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And then -	no
20481	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	or two. Yeah.	no
20482	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And then the	no
20483	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	for um	no
20484	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	the aliases and database - speaker database that the person is in,	no
20485	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	since we'll eventually anonymize and this will be a form- a place for us to	no
20486	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	connect the two. And then the meetings that they attended,	no
20487	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
20488	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	because there'll be one form for each person.	no
20489	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Sounds good.	no
20490	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	It's	no
20491	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K. So.	no
20492	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah, I guess I'll fiddle around	no
20493	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	d- I- yeah.	no
20494	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	It - it gets into a can of worms.	no
20495	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
20496	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
20497	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I mean, the more you ask, the more you realize that	no
20498	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	you're not getting	no
20499	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	N- Right.	no
20500	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
20501	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, y- you didn't really	no
20502	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So.	no
20503	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right.	no
20504	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So, there's another area which is non-native English speakers which asks for Native language,	no
20505	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Region, and Variety of English.	no
20506	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And that's it.	no
20507	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	N- detec-	no
20508	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Because it used to be that Germans would learn	no
20509	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	What about proficiency in English? as well?	no
20510	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	who've	no
20511	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	to tend toward American English.	no
20512	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Uh,	no
20513	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	That's hard though, for self-identification -	no
20514	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I -	no
20515	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I -	no
20516	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	You don't want to do it for political reasons, I mean - I'm no-	no
20517	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Hmm.	no
20518	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"I wasn't thinking about that, I was just thinking, ""Gee, I'd"	no
20519	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I wasn't thinking -	no
20520	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"like to know actually -"""	no
20521	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	oh	no
20522	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	No, no. I wasn't thinking political at	no
20523	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Oh, O_K.	no
20524	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	generally not very good at assessing their own abilities.	no
20525	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, do you think that's -	no
20526	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K.	no
20527	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	but -	no
20528	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I agree.	no
20529	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	That's also because they know that	no
20530	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	it's a re-	no
20531	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	That could be.	no
20532	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	don't you think they overrate	no
20533	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	rather than underrate?	no
20534	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	That could be.	no
20535	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yes.	no
20536	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, so maybe that's -	no
20537	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So, but no, I think proficiency is actually a good thing to	no
20538	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Maybe we - maybe we shouldn't	no
20539	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	The - the question are -	no
20540	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well,	no
20541	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	what are - what would the categories be?	no
20542	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I'd - I'd have to - I - I'd wanna relate it back to	no
20543	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Good, Bad.	no
20544	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"you know, ""have you lived in the America - in a c- an English"	no
20545	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"country before"". But it seems like that's"	no
20546	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I mean, I think that	no
20547	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	you know, if a person who -	no
20548	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"What about something like ""How comfortable are you"	no
20549	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"in a meeting conducted in English?"", or ""How easy is it for you?"", or something like that where it's -"	no

20554	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
20555	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah, that's a good one.	no

20557	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
20558	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Something - wha- what do	no
20559	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Is better.	no
20560	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	How - yeah? How long have you been in an English speaking country. O_K.	no
20561	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I think it's better.	no
20562	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
20563	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah, I	no
20564	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	That's - that's non-threatening,	no
20565	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and it's also an i-	no
20566	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah	no
20567	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	a good indicator. And there are people who	no
20568	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	um,	no
20569	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mmm.	no
20570	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	that's -	no
20571	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	you know	no
20572	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And then there will be people who	no
20573	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I do think it's a pretty good indicator.	no
20574	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	That's true too.	no
20575	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Or even,	no
20576	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
20577	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So,	no
20578	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	you know, I mean,	no
20579	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	some people who just don't	no
20580	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah, I'm - I don't know.	no
20581	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
20582	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yochai's company is like that.	no
20583	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Being totally monolingual, I'm not the right person to ask,	no
20584	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Everybody speaks Hebrew.	no
20585	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Really?	no
20586	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	to talk about this but it just seems to me that that doesn't -	no
20587	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	the length of time doesn't really get at what we're asking.	no
20588	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right? It seems to be that	no
20589	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
20590	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	other people who are just the reverse, and - and it - so many things that vary - I -	no
20591	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yes.	no
20592	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And also we wanna keep it simple and non-evaluative.	no
20593	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
20594	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K.	no
20595	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	We done?	no
20596	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	With	no
20597	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah. Oh, there's	no
20598	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Shall we wait for other forms later, or you -	no
20599	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	No, you got - what's the other form?	no
20600	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Keep going more	no
20601	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Uh, the other form is a modified	no
20602	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	uh	no
20603	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and	no
20604	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Um, so it's Name, Email, Time, Date, Seat, Session,	no
20605	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mike number, Channel, Mike type.	no
20606	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Why do we need	no
20607	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Uh, in case people have the same name.	no
20608	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Oh, I see.	no
20609	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	How often would that happen?	no
20610	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	In case people what?	no
20611	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So I wanted -	no
20612	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Have the same name.	no
20613	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Oh.	no
20614	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah, I'm particularly sensitive to this cuz a good friend of mine in S- in Seattle was named Scott Smith and there were fourteen of them in -	no
20615	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	at Boeing.	no
20616	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I see.	no
20617	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So	no
20618	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So the only -	no
20619	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	so -	no
20620	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	We could	no
20621	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, it's an - it's an interesting	no
20622	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I - now that I realize the und- the reason for it.	no
20623	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well the other thing is that potentially if this is done over a period of time, someone's email could change.	no
20624	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	The -	no
20625	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right.	no
20626	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	That's true too.	no
20627	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, the other way I was thinking about it was assigning them an I_D	no
20628	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
20629	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	but I	no
20630	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Oh yeah,	no
20631	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So, I - I wanted just	no
20632	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	who the person is if the name field isn't readable or it's a duplicate.	no
20633	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	That's interesting.	no
20634	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	How about their birthday?	no
20635	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Good idea.	no
20636	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I mean, not - not the year	no
20637	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Your mother's maiden name -	no
20638	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Oh, I see. Then, you don't hafta ask the	no
20639	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
20640	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Not the year.	no
20641	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	mother's maiden name	no
20642	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I don't know, what are the chances of people having the same name.	no
20643	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	social security number,	no
20644	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah, that's right. And a	no
20645	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	PIN.	no
20646	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Social - social	no
20647	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So, although the email - email will change, I think that's a good way of doing it. We'll be able to backtrack from email.	no
20648	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
20649	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I never thought of that as an identifier.	no
20650	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	That makes sense.	no
20651	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Um, and then the other thing I was	no
20652	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and it probably wouldn't be on the	no
20653	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
20654	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Now, the problem I	no
20655	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well,	no
20656	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	what you would put in the D_T_D that's meeting-specific. So. And it could be something like,	no
20657	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"""oh by the way,"	no
20658	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	the guy giving the presentation today	no
20659	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	is the	no
20660	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"you know, whatever""."	no
20661	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So, speaker A is his professor and they - and he's preparing for his quals or some such thing like that.	no
20662	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"Or it could be you know, ""so-and-so and so-and-so are married""."	no
20663	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Hmm.	no
20664	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Just to pick up an arbitrary an	no
20665	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	We - this wouldn't be relevant all the time but you know, if there's a big discussion on	no
20666	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	then - and these people are talking a whole lot,	no
20667	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	then it might be interesting information to say oh by the way they're married, or -	no
20668	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I - I don't mean, uh, you know.	no
20669	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right.	no
20670	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So th- so the sorts of questions	no
20671	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Who's gonna fill it out, and who's gonna take	no
20672	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I would tend to leave that	no
20673	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	e- spontaneous, I think that	no
20674	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
20675	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	e- at the stage of uh	no
20676	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Uh, sc- scanning the	no
20677	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	by our -	no
20678	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
20679	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	At	no
20680	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And that was my other question, which is	no
20681	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
20682	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
20683	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	You know, source, destination, relation.	no
20684	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Are there	no
20685	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, I ju- I was just thinking, with reference to	no
20686	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	uh, things that have - that bear on the content or the status relations,	no
20687	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	would be the things -	no
20688	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	but just like I said, if there's a k- a certain topic that comes up in the meeting, and -	no
20689	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	or	no
20690	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So, I mean, a person	no
20691	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	is asked a whole bunch of questions, more than you'd usually think they'd be asked, and it turns out it's because he's being prepared for a job interview or something like that,	no
20692	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right.	no
20693	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	then it's useful to know that - that relationship.	no
20694	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I think that fits in well with the whole meeting map -	no
20695	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	But, not to be exhaustive.	no
20696	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	mapping meetings concept is that's another way of	no
20697	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	are there anything other than pairwise?	no
20698	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Oh, well	no
20699	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Oh yeah, O_K.	no
20700	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	uh	no
20701	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So thi-	no
20702	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	or	no
20703	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Isn't this an open-ended,	no
20704	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	like	no
20705	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	basically a notes column? I mean you can imagine wanting	no
20706	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	you	no
20707	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yes,	no
20708	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	notes to - is this the - the place where we would do that, or is there another	no
20709	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I've been thi- I - it seems to be that there	no
20710	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	place.	no
20711	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	We could attach more structure if we wanted to. Especially because a	no
20712	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I- Maybe I was missing something maybe, but	no
20713	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I mean	no
20714	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	this is something one would try to	no
20715	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	How would you freeze that information about what, uh, I mean, we already have these things about someone's a professor and someone's a student, or something, but	no
20716	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
20717	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	would you - would you -	no
20718	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Some person would be writing O_K this person was leading the meeting and that was or - or - is that what you mean, or -	no
20719	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	What - what - what - uh,	no
20720	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Um, just as an	no
20721	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Oh, so you're just putting	no
20722	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	preexisting	no
20723	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	relationships that are	no
20724	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	that are relevant.	no
20725	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I think that starts to -	no
20726	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I see.	no
20727	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	There's definitely some clear cases,	no
20728	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	but there are a lot of gray areas, where	no
20729	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	yeah.	no
20730	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yep.	no
20731	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	the context	no
20732	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	happens	no
20733	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	just in that meeting, or, I mean, where you don't wanna sort of	no
20734	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah, I m-	no
20735	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	have to	no
20736	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	make a distinction between a pre-existing	no
20737	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	relationship, or	no
20738	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, realize, w- this was -	no
20739	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	the idea	no
20740	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Otherwise, they would -	no
20741	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	it would be possible to have a	no
20742	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	But I mean, there are some that generalize	no
20743	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	higher level thing.	no
20744	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right, but that example was not -	no
20745	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	over many meetings and there are some that don't, and there are some	no
20746	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right, so my example was not a good one,	no
20747	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	things that happen in between meetings,	no
20748	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
20749	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	because that's -	no
20750	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So, I mean, for -	no
20751	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and -	no
20752	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	The first meeting was a - was a front-end meeting, and in that one, the basic form of that was uh, I was the leader,	no
20753	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"and I was saying uh, ""what are the results you've gotten in the last week?"""	no
20754	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And they were - and uh one person was sort of taking the lead,	no
20755	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	in describing what the results were,	no
20756	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"and then uh, Chuck was taking the role of saying, ""well, what did you mean by that?"", so he was sort of like the out- s- semi-outsider, asking curiosity questions."	no
20757	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"And then it would come back to me with saying ""well, you know, you showed me"	no
20758	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	so it was very much sort of	no
20759	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"""Leader"" and - and - and - and ""Led"" sort of relationship."	no
20760	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And um	no
20761	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	the guy I was primarily doing this with uh is - is a visiting researcher,	no
20762	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	uh, in this l- meeting,	no
20763	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	uh, you are my graduate student,	no
20764	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	but uh it's not taking that kind of role at all,	no
20765	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right.	no
20766	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	right? You're - you're - you're actually leading the meeting for the most part,	no
20767	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, it's just cuz it's my turn.	no
20768	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So	no
20769	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Uh	no
20770	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah, so I - I don't know, so you're suggesting -	no
20771	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I think this one needs to be open-ended,	no
20772	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	the only concern	no
20773	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, the- there's -	no
20774	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I mean.	no
20775	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I - g- you -	no
20776	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, the D_T_Ds mean we can	no
20777	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	but -	no
20778	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	do whatever -	no
20779	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
20780	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	however we want it.	no
20781	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	the reason that I	no
20782	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Especially with these	no
20783	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So you mean like -	no
20784	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	that	no
20785	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Is there a way that we can add keywords or sub-	no
20786	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I don't know what you would call them, but little labels	no
20787	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	for things that we decide are useful things to have	no
20788	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Sure, absolutely.	no
20789	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	but	no
20790	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	You know, as long as we have this one	no
20791	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	place where it can all be stored, then we're fine, I think.	no
20792	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right, cuz it seems like it's sort of a -	no
20793	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right.	no
20794	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	some totally different	no
20795	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"Exactly. It's sort of a research question, you - you're analyzing the meeting and you're deciding, ""ah, there's this kind of structure to it."""	no
20796	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	keyword.	no
20797	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Y- Yeah, it's - it's -	no
20798	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	it's gonna change -	no
20799	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	It's gonna change, and maybe we wanna regroup things under different labels later, if we figure out that these pairwise things are -	no
20800	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
20801	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
20802	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Interesting.	no
20803	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right	no
20804	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well I think -	no
20805	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	being - being in a common organization was one I hadn't thought of, that -	no
20806	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So you're	no
20807	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So the	no
20808	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	uh, power, responsibility.	no
20809	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I guess husband-wife is yet another one.	no
20810	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And so, you know, in discourse	no
20811	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	analysis you get things like	no
20812	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Ach!	no
20813	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	the	no
20814	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	You have - you have a	no
20815	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Hmm.	no
20816	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Role, yeah.	no
20817	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	how you're perceived and how y- and how the other	no
20818	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
20819	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	You know, and so there are	no
20820	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And	no
20821	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"e- with - by having a searchable field like ""role"""	no
20822	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"and then you know ""within this context this person has the following roles"","	no
20823	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
20824	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and it could be very loose, but then it would be possible to	no
20825	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
20826	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	do something as simple as a grep across a database and if you're interested in	no
20827	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	you know which - which - which ones this person serves as an advisor in and versus	no
20828	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	you know a l- uh s- uh	no
20829	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	whatever, a leader, speaker, whatever,	no
20830	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
20831	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and - and	no
20832	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	you know, some - some particular	no
20833	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
20834	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So it sounds like having the facility is great, and then over a period of time as the research happens on this we might develop	no
20835	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Some more.	no
20836	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	generally useful and it - it sounds like a good thing to do.	no
20837	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And -	no
20838	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K.	no
20839	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And	no
20840	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Nope.	no
20841	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah, so what I have right now is all pairwise, so that's probably not sufficient.	no
20842	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
20843	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I think you don't need to have that much structure built in, and that would	no
20844	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah, maybe not.	no
20845	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	be less time-consuming to do it this way first, and then find out what structure's needed.	no
20846	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yep.	no
20847	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K.	no
20848	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	what about all of the meetings that have been recorded so far that - without this?	no
20849	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Will -	no
20850	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Will somebody go back and fill that	no
20851	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, I	no
20852	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So	no
20853	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mmm.	no
20854	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Almost all of the meetings	no
20855	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	that we have	no
20856	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	are recorded with roughly	no
20857	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right.	no
20858	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	a fair minority with the group that we have in the	no
20859	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right.	no
20860	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So it -	no
20861	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So it wouldn't be that hard to go back and -	no
20862	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	We can regenerate a	no
20863	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
20864	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
20865	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	But -	no
20866	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	generate it, I think it's alright to have some of the sections in your	no
20867	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	database blank,	no
20868	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
20869	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	that this information was	no
20870	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And there's just not gonna be a way	no
20871	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	That's just gonna	no
20872	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	like the N_S_	no
20873	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	the	no
20874	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I don't think they're gonna want to fill	no
20875	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
20876	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So.	no
20877	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K, enough on forms.	yes
20878	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K, so we're running kind of late, so we'll probably wanna zip through some other things, maybe	no
20879	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	do some more time on - on Jose's stuff later, um	no
20880	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Uh, I guess, you know, we - we recently woke up um our friends and uh	no
20881	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	so I - I guess - you've sent off this - the uh	no
20882	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	C_D-ROMs	no
20883	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	from uh I_B_M about -	no
20884	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	They haven't	no
20885	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	but I	no
20886	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"""Yes we're still alive, we haven't done anything yet."" basically."	no
20887	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
20888	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And uh -	no
20889	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Was there some suggestion that they might soon, or -	no
20890	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah. So - so, they've	no
20891	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
20892	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	transferred the responsibility to someone else. I	no
20893	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
20894	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And so he sent me email and said he's gonna be starting to work on it, and I haven't received anything else.	no
20895	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Great, O_K. Well, that was that one.	no
20896	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So.	no
20897	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
20898	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Um,	no
20899	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So	no
20900	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Actually he should have	no
20901	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Give him a day.	no
20902	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	um, and I think we should just sort of look at this thing from you, off-line Jose cuz it's getting kind of late but I mean I think the bottom line just glancing through it is that there's - there's a	no
20903	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
20904	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	in just	no
20905	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
20906	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I mean, that's sort of -	no
20907	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And uh what - the - so I'd -	no
20908	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	What about that error that -	no
20909	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	that uh	no
20910	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	The residual error?	no
20911	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	the supposed lub- no, the supposed	no
20912	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	that we were - We were guessing you had a bug before because	no
20913	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
20914	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Ah, yeah yeah. I - I found the error,	no
20915	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and I repeated the experiments eh and here, eh	no
20916	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	eh	no
20917	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Ah.	no
20918	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K, so this is post bug fix.	no
20919	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K?	no
20920	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So um - so I had two thought just glancing through this. So, one is - one is that um	no
20921	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	that uh	no
20922	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	we might wanna talk about normalization.	no
20923	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I mean, I don't know what normalizations you use. Sometimes things have more overlap before you've done	no
20924	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	some kind of normalization	no
20925	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
20926	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And the other thing is that, if that	no
20927	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
20928	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I mean, residual L_P_C energy and just plain energy are very closely	no
20929	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
20930	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	um	no
20931	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	um	no
20932	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Hmm.	no
20933	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	relationship to or - fit - fit to pitch tracks on uh - on either side of - of it, for instance?	no
20934	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
20935	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	You know, so if - if there's uh a really bad fit between	no
20936	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	where the pitch is going in this suppose - uh hypothesized region of overlap,	no
20937	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and the - the - and one or the other uh side,	no
20938	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Another	no
20939	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	you know, then this - this - this might	no
20940	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	an alteration in th- in the tracking way.	no
20941	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	uh, suggest a -	no
20942	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Excuse me?	no
20943	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	You mean that eh you ehm	no
20944	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I understand that eh you - you mean eh to - to study the alteration	no
20945	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	between the - the tracking of the pitch eh if we compare the overlapping zone with a speaker zone.	no
20946	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I- if you have two - if you have two - if you have	no
20947	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	in the co- in the	no
20948	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	two	no
20949	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	people speaking	no
20950	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
20951	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	uh	no
20952	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	there's an overlap, then - I mean the first thing is that there should be a mixture of harmonics	no
20953	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
20954	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And um	no
20955	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	the - any - a measure that you have of how much of the energy is due to your best guess at a particular harmonic sequence,	no
20956	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	it's also going to be a smaller	no
20957	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Uh-huh.	no
20958	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
20959	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	there	no
20960	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
20961	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	but - maybe it'll have something to - have a different character.	no
20962	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	if - unless this is a normalization problem, it looks from your results like there's so much overlap that	no
20963	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Uh-huh.	no
20964	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K.	no
20965	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Are -	no
20966	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Are the things in the -	no
20967	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I don't normalicized eh in these er- experiments.	no
20968	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	by the moment. I don't normalicize.	no
20969	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K, so the question is - is - would some kind of normalization	no
20970	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah?	no
20971	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	You know, uh, i- i- it could be that if you normalized uh by the overall	no
20972	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Nnn. Yeah.	no
20973	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	um	no
20974	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	The different zone.	no
20975	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	uh, I - I don't know.	no
20976	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So, uh, from -	no
20977	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	from these charts,	no
20978	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	are - hmm, I'm just trying to	no
20979	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
20980	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
20981	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
20982	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So, if you look at -	no
20983	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	on this page that has uh frame energy, you look at the mean for the overlap, that's forty-four point sixty-two versus the mean for the speakers, thirty-nine point sixty-two, so there seems to be more energy when there's overlapping which	no
20984	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
20985	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
20986	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
20987	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Which is the intuition, un- unfortunately there's a standard deviation of like ten, so	no
20988	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	makes sense, but -	no
20989	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
20990	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
20991	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah, different than standard deviation.	no
20992	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Oh.	no
20993	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	The	no
20994	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	But are we assuming	no
20995	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
20996	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	that you could	no
20997	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	know the energy for a speaker when there's no overlap? I mean	no
20998	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I can imagine a model where you say, O_K, you know	no
20999	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I'm - I'm gonna give myself - it's cheating, but	no
21000	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	not completely if they're	no
21001	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	often not overlapping	no
21002	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and normalized for the speaker	no
21003	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21004	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	or is that	no
21005	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	not allowed. I mean, what's the -	no
21006	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, that's what I was suggesting, that y- you wanna do some kind of longer time normalization eh with the -	no
21007	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21008	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21009	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	But -	no
21010	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	even if you make a mistake occasionally, that - that i- is roughly	no
21011	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	right	no
21012	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	i- is there some	no
21013	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	corresponding to that	no
21014	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21015	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	because that - that's gonna spread out these distributions really a lot, to	no
21016	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	right	no
21017	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	so the um - just one more clarifying question - On the overlap category,	no
21018	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	overlapping of speakers	no
21019	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	only?	no
21020	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21021	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	It doesn't include some of the other sounds?	no
21022	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	No.	no
21023	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	It's a pu- pure overlapping zone. I mean that eh overlapping between two, three, four eh eh speaker.	no
21024	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So that's why it doesn't add up down -	no
21025	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K.	no
21026	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And -	no
21027	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K.	no
21028	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And did - is this from the mixed signal?	no
21029	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Th-	no
21030	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21031	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K, so there	no
21032	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right,	no
21033	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	right.	no
21034	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21035	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	uh over the entire signal.	no
21036	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right.	no
21037	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	That's what makes it	no
21038	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Because they - they're -	no
21039	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21040	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	a high standard deviation and they're already roughly	no
21041	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21042	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	so that each person's	no
21043	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right.	no
21044	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right.	no
21045	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	What	no
21046	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Sorry?	no
21047	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	What about,	no
21048	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	uh	no
21049	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	this graphic?	no
21050	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, I - I'm thinking - so	no
21051	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	they're raising the question about the fact	no
21052	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	that	no
21053	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	if you use the	no
21054	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah. I use the mixed signal	no
21055	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	there's already been a -	no
21056	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	without	no
21057	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	without normalization, but -	no
21058	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, but the mixed signal already	no
21059	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I - I'm wo-	no
21060	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	but	no
21061	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Ah.	no
21062	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	recordings.	no
21063	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I - I don't study the single channel	no
21064	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	yet	no
21065	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	but eh	no
21066	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	is eh - is an idea.	no
21067	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, I think it'll be worse, right, I think the mixed -	no
21068	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	to - to begin to work with the	no
21069	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I have	no
21070	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Um, this is - this is	no
21071	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	frames have a lot of	no
21072	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	variance to them because different sounds	no
21073	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	are different	no
21074	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So	no
21075	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21076	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I mean, what if you took uh one second	no
21077	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	chunks or something like that. Or - or	no
21078	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	maybe not even a	no
21079	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah, like two hundred milliseconds or twenty to twenty-five frames, or	no
21080	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21081	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right.	no
21082	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Or window it - hamming window.	no
21083	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21084	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So then you - you'll - you know -	no
21085	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21086	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21087	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and then you looked at the amount of energy in	no
21088	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and how does	no
21089	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Uh-huh.	no
21090	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	or	no
21091	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	can we tell? can we - sorry	no
21092	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	or voiced regions.	no
21093	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Interesting.	no
21094	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I mean, is it	no
21095	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, I mean, you could do a -	no
21096	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	you could first determine that something was voiced or not.	no
21097	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I mean like if	no
21098	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	do we know that the first speaker's voicing, or not?	no
21099	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, I mean the overlaps are typically more than just a tiny little bit of time and so uh there could be voiced and non-voiced pieces during the overlap.	no
21100	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Ah.	no
21101	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Huh.	no
21102	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
21103	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	But will we be able t- to detect the voicing when there's overlap?	no
21104	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I don't	no
21105	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	it's -	no
21106	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So	no
21107	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	this - this has to do with these questions of harmonicity, and so forth, right?	no
21108	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21109	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	yeah,	no
21110	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21111	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21112	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	then um, voiced regions would be, like, probably more informative,	no
21113	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21114	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	for energy because -	no
21115	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right, so you could do something like, uh	no
21116	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and pi- and pitch for that matter.	no
21117	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	but -	no
21118	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Sure.	no
21119	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	But I think what will be easy for him to do would be to do this thing of looking over a large enough region of	no
21120	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	a fair amount of voiced uh energy	no
21121	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right.	no
21122	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And so I think that would be -	no
21123	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And he has on his graph something like forty percent.	no
21124	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	It looked like	no
21125	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	overlap	no
21126	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	It's li- I think the last page.	no
21127	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21128	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Is it?	no
21129	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Here in the - yeah it - it's a new -	no
21130	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	a new diapositive with information about the context for overlapping zone.	no
21131	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Nope, not the last page.	no
21132	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Um.	no
21133	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Where was it?	no
21134	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	It was one of the tables.	no
21135	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	What?	no
21136	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	How define?	no
21137	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Are you using a pitch detector in this	no
21138	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I-	no
21139	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	experiments?	no
21140	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Do you have a pitch detector that you're	no
21141	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	using?	no
21142	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Eh - j- my?	no
21143	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Do you -	no
21144	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Pitch.	no
21145	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	do you have a - a	no
21146	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	that you are using	no
21147	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	eh, I - I'm - working now with pitch detector.	no
21148	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	in these experiments?	no
21149	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, it's the	no
21150	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I'm working now, but eh I haven't eh results yet. But eh at this moment I - I - I prepare, I am - I am preparing the - the pitch eh eh tracking.	no
21151	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21152	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	pitch tracker eh algorithm that I have but eh	no
21153	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Does -	no
21154	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	does it have a voiced, unvoiced uh	no
21155	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	detector in it, uh?	no
21156	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	No.	no
21157	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	It	no
21158	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	it just finds the pi- it just finds the pitch even when it's	no
21159	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	eh, I - I -	no
21160	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I mean, it must have some -	no
21161	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	It	no
21162	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	It	no
21163	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	It has to give you at least a zero, one, I mean uh d- binary -	no
21164	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21165	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21166	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	It's	no
21167	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	between frame the	no
21168	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21169	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	but eh I don't know what is ehm - eh -	no
21170	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right.	no
21171	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	because it's no my - my algorithm.	no
21172	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah. So ordinarily in these things, it does tell you that it's -	no
21173	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Is -	no
21174	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	it's voiced with a pitch of such-and-such.	no
21175	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And it will - i- i-	no
21176	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Uh-huh.	no
21177	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	it will say something like zero or you know it'll have something that it says when it's - when it can't find a good -	no
21178	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	good uh uh period, right? So it's looking for some periodic behavior, and if it can't find a period it tells you	no
21179	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Uh-huh.	no
21180	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Uh-huh.	no
21181	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	for - for most things like that.	no
21182	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	For most	no
21183	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So I mean, this is, getting back to what Liz was suggesting which I think actually is good,	no
21184	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	the more I think of it, that - that um	no
21185	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	voiced sections and normalize to equalize the energy in	no
21186	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I'm just still going back to normalization, that even though it's	no
21187	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	it's - it - it may not be normalized enough.	no
21188	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Uh-huh.	no
21189	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	For b- for both, for eh the frame energy and eh	no
21190	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Uh, for both, yeah.	no
21191	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	too.	no
21192	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	For	no
21193	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21194	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21195	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	but eh	no
21196	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I test different normalization	no
21197	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I - eh	no
21198	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	What kind of normalization?	no
21199	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K, so - so I think	no
21200	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I mean,	no
21201	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21202	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	if um	no
21203	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21204	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	u- as I understand it, you have - you have some	no
21205	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	regions that uh	no
21206	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	um	no
21207	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	are marked, as - You have training data that you're trying to find a threshold, right? and so	no
21208	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Uh-huh.	no
21209	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	um	no
21210	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	um if you take	no
21211	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	um	no
21212	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	all the things - all the uh	no
21213	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"speak things marked ""S_P_K"","	no
21214	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and uh look for the voiced	no
21215	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	uh energy in them,	no
21216	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Uh-huh.	no
21217	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and uh	no
21218	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	well, just in - in each case, take a - take a - take a frame,	no
21219	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	if it's - if it's voiced,	no
21220	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	include it, -	no
21221	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Just separate out from the - from the normal things, separate out voiced.	no
21222	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.	no
21223	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21224	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	with uh a - a uh - a mean uh standard devia- deviation, and so forth. And then do your normalization based on	no
21225	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21226	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21227	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And once you	no
21228	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	just for	no
21229	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	um	no
21230	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I guess you'd -	no
21231	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	You can also	no
21232	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	later. I mean, that would be the most sensitive measure.	no
21233	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	because	no
21234	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	you know, if you're normalizing for voiced, and then you look at regions that are voiced with the same robustness in estimation of what voicing is, um,	no
21235	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	you should be much more sensitive to the -	no
21236	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21237	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	to the overlaps then if you - you know if you	no
21238	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21239	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	at fricatives or something you won't really know anything.	no
21240	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So	no
21241	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I mean assuming if it's	no
21242	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right.	no
21243	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	long enough	no
21244	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	that there's some voicing in each of them, by each of the speakers, then you should do very well if you do this. But you'll only know that in the re- voiced regions but those are close enough to the -	no
21245	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right.	no
21246	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right.	no
21247	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Hmm.	no
21248	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	You know, there's enough voicing going on and off uh that if you can capture the voicing	no
21249	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Uh-huh.	no
21250	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and if you can capture it when there's overlap	no
21251	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	then you should do quite well	no
21252	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mmm.	no
21253	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	there.	no
21254	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	um if there - I suppose this is still just that one -	no
21255	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	that one data sample, right, that one meeting?	no
21256	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21257	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	But	no
21258	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	it seems like	no
21259	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	to have -	no
21260	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	it - it seems like a very hard test to have it be looking at the energy of all the speakers combined	no
21261	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	rather than	no
21262	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	taking s- you know, maybe two	no
21263	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	if it's	no
21264	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	that type of analysis. If you take like a target speaker, and	no
21265	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	w-	no
21266	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21267	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	well, I mean, if there's enough data, maybe two -	no
21268	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	two target speakers and then compare that to the mixture of all the speakers.	no
21269	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	You could do that, yeah.	no
21270	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I mean, be - i- And if they still overlapped, i- i- the -	no
21271	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	That's hard.	no
21272	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	But - but I - I think that	no
21273	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	to just sort of see.	no
21274	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And - and what this says is that - th- that	no
21275	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21276	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K.	no
21277	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And so -	no
21278	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I mean	no
21279	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	coming back to Jose's	no
21280	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	What do you look at in order to normalize? I mean, dur- you - you get some data in, you don't know which it is,	no
21281	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	how do you - how do you -	no
21282	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	W- w- what period of time do you look over to normalize it	no
21283	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21284	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	by?	no
21285	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And - and uh,	no
21286	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21287	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I think	no
21288	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	also the	no
21289	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	harmonics would be very important.	no
21290	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So if you can find voiced regions and - You know,	no
21291	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yes.	no
21292	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	unless they have very similar, you know, pitch, you should be able to see the	no
21293	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right, so that's what we were talking about	no
21294	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Um -	no
21295	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	just by counting them, I mean	no
21296	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21297	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And -	no
21298	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	the length -	no
21299	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21300	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	It seems like with	no
21301	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21302	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	the overlaps being fairly	no
21303	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	that	no
21304	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21305	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right,	no
21306	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	That r- that was an	no
21307	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and you could put an estimate - estimate, you know, a	no
21308	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21309	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21310	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	That they're much	no
21311	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21312	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	But this is very short.	no
21313	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	time.	no
21314	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21315	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	two m-	no
21316	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21317	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21318	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Is a problem to detect.	no
21319	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, it's sort of	no
21320	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	But -	no
21321	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	It	no
21322	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	It's a problem to -	no
21323	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	but it	no
21324	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	It's a problem to identify and to detect,	no
21325	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	with eh the Javier system, for example.	no
21326	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yes.	no
21327	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	It's a problem.	no
21328	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21329	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Uh, well.	no
21330	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Uh	no
21331	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Eh, what -	no
21332	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Good.	no
21333	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21334	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	What - what happened with the different contexts because eh	no
21335	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	the period or the - the duration of the - the window to eh the - the long	no
21336	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	of the window to - to consider normalization	no
21337	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	But eh we have different contexts.	no
21338	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah, and I - I -	no
21339	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	The - the - the - the period - the - the - the length of the window to - to normalize eh the energy is eh in the context of the overlapping zone?	no
21340	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Is eh in the - in the	no
21341	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	You mean?	no
21342	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I don't know.	no
21343	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I - I wanna think about it and you should think about it. I - I - I didn't want to just pop out an answer because I realized I - I hadn't thought about it enough.	no
21344	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21345	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K.	no
21346	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Because - because the - the - the problem is that we have different contexts.	no
21347	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah, something -	no
21348	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Different situation, and -	no
21349	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	somethin-	no
21350	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	That's true.	no
21351	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	That's complicated.	no
21352	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	too.	no
21353	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Just out of curiosity, what was the bug?	no
21354	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I'm not sure.	no
21355	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21356	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	What was the bug that you found?	no
21357	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	What the bu-	no
21358	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	The bug from last uh meeting?	no
21359	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Ah, the bug.	no
21360	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	The bug of - was the - the F_seek function in C_.	no
21361	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	because doesn't work uh when you eh -	no
21362	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	you try to - to - to ass- n- n- to do an - a dated	no
21363	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	to - to a file, a big file, eh eh moving the - the head of the - in the hard disk, eh e- forward and backward	no
21364	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
21365	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	a lot of time eh	no
21366	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
21367	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	in a moment	no
21368	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Hmm.	no
21369	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and I had an problem.	no
21370	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Ah, that's interesting, and it didn't give you good	no
21371	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yes, this is - this is -	no
21372	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	it's incredible.	no
21373	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Huh.	no
21374	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Hmm!	no
21375	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I - I - I do the same in - in another - in another way and I haven't problem.	no
21376	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So it was positioning randomly?	no
21377	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Did you	no
21378	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	typecast to long?	no
21379	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	or	no
21380	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	size-T_ or whatever it is? I don't remember what it is.	no
21381	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	One of the problems, if the file is	no
21382	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	um, and you're cast to the wrong	no
21383	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I -	no
21384	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I - I don't know, but uh I - I think the - the position in the file	no
21385	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	eh	no
21386	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	doesn't work	no
21387	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	eh eh in long file,	no
21388	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	a very long file.	no
21389	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, what he's saying is that the typecasting could be the issue,	no
21390	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right, if you're sending	no
21391	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	for F_seek.	no
21392	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	The typecast.	no
21393	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"Typecast from integer, ""int"""	no
21394	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I_N_T	no
21395	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21396	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	or	no
21397	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	or	no
21398	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	eh it's ehm	no
21399	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I think it's -	no
21400	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	No, no, it's unsigned.	no
21401	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21402	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well,	no
21403	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	It's	no
21404	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah, cuz I think in - I mean, in general F_seek	no
21405	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I - I - I don't know	no
21406	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yep.	no
21407	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I don't know but eh I - I solved the problem with eh	no
21408	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah,	no
21409	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21410	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	a similar way and	no

21412	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21413	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	but eh I - I - I don't know because eh	no
21414	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21415	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	eh it doesn't eh happen to me before.	no

21419	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I - I - I have the same codes in different parts,	no
21420	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and uh I - I had to - to - to change all - all the points in the - in the code,	no
21421	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	eh to substitute eh for another way, but	no
21422	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yep.	no
21423	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	eh - is	no
21424	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Anyway, we're - we're missing snacks here, so uh -	no
21425	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Shall we do digits?	no
21426	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Oh, digits.	no

21567	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
21568	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah. We didn't	no
21569	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And let's remember also to make sure that one's	no
21570	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	O_K.	no
21571	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	M_R eleven.	no
21572	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	M_R eleven.	no

21575	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	O_K. So.	no
21576	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Agenda.	no
21577	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Any agenda	no
21578	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I wanna talk a little bit about getting -	no
21579	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	how we're gonna to get people to edit	no
21580	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	parts of the meeting that they don't want to include.	no
21581	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	What I've done so far, and I wanna get some opinions on, how to - how to finish it up.	no
21582	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	O_K.	no
21583	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I wanna ask about um,	no
21584	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	some aud- audio monitoring	no
21585	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	on some of the	no
21586	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	some of the equipment.	no
21587	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	In particular, the - well	no
21588	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	uh, that's just what I wanna ask.	no
21589	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	O_K audio monitoring, Jane.	no
21590	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Ba- based on some of the tran- uh - i-	no
21591	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	In listening to	no
21592	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	and in pact - in fact this one I'm talking on is one of - of the ones that showed up in	no
21593	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Oh really.	no
21594	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	"""Spikes"", you mean like uh, instantaneous click type spikes, or - ?"	no
21595	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Spikes?	no
21596	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Clicks.	no
21597	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
21598	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Hmm.	no
21599	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
21600	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Huh.	no
21601	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And I don't know what the e- electronics is but.	no
21602	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
21603	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah. Well, I think it's	no
21604	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Touching.	no
21605	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	uh, it - it could be a number of things. It could be touching and fiddling, and the other thing is that it could - the fact that it's on a wired mike is suspicious. It might be a connector.	no
21606	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
21607	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Oh, O_K.	no
21608	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Well maybe -	no
21609	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Then we don't really have to talk about that as an - I - I take that off the agenda.	no
21610	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	"You could try an experiment and say ""O_K, I'm about to test for spikes"", and then wiggle the thing there, and then"	no
21611	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
21612	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	go and when they go to transcribe it, it could, ask them to come and get you.	no
21613	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Oh that -	no
21614	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Well,	no
21615	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Um.	no
21616	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	No I'm just -	no
21617	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	O_K.	no
21618	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I mean,	no
21619	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	were this a	no
21620	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	professional audio recording,	no
21621	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	what we would do -	no
21622	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	what you would do is - in	no
21623	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	make sure that - that - that things are not giving that kind of performance.	no
21624	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And if they are, then they can't be used.	no
21625	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Right.	no
21626	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So.	no
21627	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Um. Let's see. I guess	no
21628	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	uh, recording, transcription	no
21629	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Good.	no
21630	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And then um,	no
21631	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	the other thing which I would like to talk about which is a real meta-quest, I think, deal is, uh, agendas.	no
21632	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So maybe I'll - I'll start with that actually. Uh,	no
21633	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	um.	no
21634	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Andreas brought up	no
21635	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	the fact that he would	no
21636	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	if	no
21637	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	he's	no
21638	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	sort of	no
21639	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	and if there's gonna be a topic about -	no
21640	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	discussion about something that he	no
21641	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	uh strongly cares about then he would come and -	no
21642	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And I think part of -	no
21643	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	because of uh	no
21644	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	the fact that the meetings are - are tending to become	no
21645	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	reasonably large now on days when everybody shows up and so,	no
21646	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	he figures he could help that out by	no
21647	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Mmm.	no
21648	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	out his own time.	no
21649	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	meeting that he's - he's -	no
21650	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So, uh in order -	no
21651	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I'd - I think that	no
21652	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	this is a	no
21653	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	uh things come up that are unanticipated and - and -	no
21654	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	But um,	no
21655	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Right.	no
21656	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	we could	no
21657	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	do another try at coming up with the agenda	no
21658	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	uh, at some point before the meeting,	no
21659	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	uh, say the day before.	no
21660	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Well maybe it would be a good idea for one of us to	no
21661	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
21662	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	O_K.	no
21663	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	You - you wanna volunteer to do that?	no
21664	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Sure.	no
21665	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	O_K.	no
21666	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Alright so we'll send out agenda request.	no
21667	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Uh.	no
21668	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Let me	no
21669	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	That'll be - I think that'll help -	no
21670	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I'll put that on my spare brain or it will not	no
21671	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	That'll help a lot, actually.	no
21672	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah, I have to tell you for the uh - for the admin meeting that we have, Lila does that um every time before an admin meeting.	no
21673	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And uh, she ends up getting the agenda requests uh, uh ten minutes before the meeting. But - but -	no
21674	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Uh.	no
21675	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	But we can	no
21676	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Maybe it'll work.	no
21677	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Mmm.	no
21678	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
21679	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Weirder things have happened.	no
21680	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
21681	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I'm wondering if he were to just, uh, specify particular topics, I mean.	no
21682	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Maybe we'd be able to meet that request of his a little more.	no
21683	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I would - I would also guess that as we get more into processing the data and things like that there'll be more things of interest to him.	no
21684	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Well then -	yes
21685	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I would - I would also guess that as we get more into processing the data and things like that there'll be more things of interest to him.	no
21686	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
21687	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Actually it -	no
21688	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	This - this maybe brings up another topic which is um -	no
21689	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So we're done with that topic.	no
21690	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	The other topic I was thinking of was	no
21691	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	the sta- status on microphones and channels, and all that.	no
21692	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah, actually I - I was going to say we need to	no
21693	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
21694	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Why - why don't we do that.	no
21695	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	O_K. Um, the new microphones, the	no
21696	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Um.	no
21697	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And I didn't bring my car today so I'm gonna pick them up tomorrow.	no
21698	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Um, and then the other	no
21699	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	well, a	no
21700	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	if the other headsets are a lot more comfortable, we should probably just go ahead and get them.	no
21701	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So we'll have to evaluate that when they come in,	no
21702	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	and get people's opinions on - on what they think of them.	no
21703	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Uh-	no
21704	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Um, then the	no
21705	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Another wireless setup. I mean it's	no
21706	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So how many channels do you get to have	no
21707	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	in a wireless setup?	no
21708	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Um,	no
21709	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	well,	no
21710	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I'm pretty sure that you can daisy-chain them together so what we would do is replace the wired mikes with wireless.	no
21711	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So we currently have one base station with six wireless mike,	no
21712	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	possibility of six wireless receivers, and apparently you	no
21713	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And so we could replace our wired mikes with wireless if we bought another base station and more wireless mikes.	no
21714	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So, um.	no
21715	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And -	no
21716	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So let's see we -	no
21717	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So, you know it's still, it's fifteen minus six.	no
21718	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Right? So we could have up to nine.	no
21719	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And right now we can have up to six.	no
21720	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Right.	no
21721	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And we	no
21722	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
21723	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And it's um, about nine hundred dollars for the base station,	no
21724	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	and then eight hundred per channel.	no
21725	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Oh. So yeah so the only -	no
21726	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Beyond the mike - the cost of the mikes the only thing is the base station that's nine hundred dollars.	no
21727	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Right.	no
21728	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Oh, we should do it.	no
21729	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	O_K.	no
21730	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
21731	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	O_K, so I'll look into how you daisy-chain them and - and then just go ahead and order them.	no
21732	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
21733	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I don't quite understand how that - how that works,. If -	no
21734	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So we're not	no
21735	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	No, we're just replacing the wired - the two wired that are still	no
21736	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	O_K. O_K. I see.	no
21737	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	along with a couple of the wired that	no
21738	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	with a wireless.	no
21739	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah. Basically we found -	no
21740	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Three wireds work, right?	no
21741	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I - I guess three wireds work, yeah.	no
21742	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah. Yeah.	no
21743	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah. But we've had more problems with that.	no
21744	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yep.	no
21745	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And that sort of bypasses the whole - the whole Jimbox thing and all that.	no
21746	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Right.	no
21747	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And so	no
21748	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	um,	no
21749	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	we - we seem to have uh, a reliable way of getting the data in, which is through the ra- Sony radio mikes, as long as we're conscious about the batteries.	no
21750	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	That seems to be the key	no
21751	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Right.	no
21752	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Everyone's battery O_K?	no
21753	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	issue.	no
21754	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I checked them this morning, they should be.	no
21755	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	O_K.	no
21756	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
21757	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Um,	no
21758	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Um I heard from U_W that they're - they're uh very close to getting their, uh setup purchased. They're - they're - they're buying something that you can just sort of buy off the shelf.	no
21759	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Well we should talk to them about it because I know that S_R_I is also in the process of looking at stuff,	no
21760	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	and so, you know, what we should try to keep everyone - on the same page with that.	no
21761	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
21762	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	S_R_I, really?	no
21763	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
21764	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Oh.	no
21765	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	They got sa- apparent-	no
21766	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Maybe	no
21767	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Uh, I don't know. Probably we shouldn't - probably we shouldn't talk about funding stuff.	no
21768	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I don't know how much of it's public.	no
21769	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Right.	no
21770	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
21771	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	But anyway there's - there's - there's uh, uh other activities that are going on there and - and uh - and NIST and U_W. So.	no
21772	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Um. But - but yeah I thin- I think that at least the message we can tell other people is that our experience is - is quite positive with the Sony, uh,	no
21773	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Right.	no
21774	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Now the	no
21775	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	which means some hand-soldering or something, right?	no
21776	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Uh, no, we're having the -	no
21777	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	No?	no
21778	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Oh.	no
21779	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	O_K.	no
21780	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So, they - they charge	no
21781	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Nothing against you and your	no
21782	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	You've never	no
21783	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	But uh,	no
21784	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Uh,	no
21785	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	O_K, so that's being done professionally and -	no
21786	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	a- as I said they're coming in.	no
21787	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I - I mean - Yeah. I mean.	no
21788	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
21789	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	As professionally as I guess you can get it done.	no
21790	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Well,	no
21791	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	it could - if they do a lot of it, it's -	no
21792	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I mean i- it's just their repair shop.	no
21793	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Right? Their maintenance people.	no
21794	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Well, we'll see what it - it's like. That - tha- that	no
21795	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yep.	no
21796	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Th- this - Yeah, O_K.	no
21797	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Good. Yeah. So let's go with that. Uh,	no
21798	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And, I mean we'll see,	yes
21799	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And, I mean we'll see,	no
21800	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
21801	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So, um,	no
21802	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	uh,	no
21803	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Dave isn't here but he was going to	no
21804	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	start working on some things with the digits.	no
21805	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Uh,	no
21806	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	so he'll be interested in what's going on with	no
21807	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	the uh transcribers were going to be doing stuff with the digits as well?	no
21808	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Mm-hmm. Yeah.	no
21809	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Has that started, or is that - ?	no
21810	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Uh, it would be to use his interface and I was going to meet with him today about that.	no
21811	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Right, so, the decision was that Jane did	no
21812	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So all the - all the	no
21813	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And uh, then I have a bunch of scripts that we'll read those and	no
21814	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	let the uh	no
21815	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So he has a nice set up that they -	no
21816	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	it w- it will be efficient for them to do that.	no
21817	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	O_K. So anyway -	no
21818	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I - I don't think it'll take too long.	no
21819	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So, you know, just uh, a matter of a few days I suspect.	no
21820	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So anyway I think we - we have at least one uh, user	no
21821	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	for the digits once they get done, which will be Dave.	no
21822	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Right.	no
21823	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	O_K.	no
21824	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I've already done five or six	no
21825	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So if he wanted to, you know, just have a few to start with, he	no
21826	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah, he might - he might be asking -	no
21827	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	You know, and I also have a bunch of scripts that will, like, generate P_files and run recognition on them also.	no
21828	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Right.	no
21829	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	O_K.	no
21830	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Uh, is Dave -	no
21831	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I don't know if Dave is on the list,	no
21832	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	if he's invited to these meetings, uh	no
21833	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	if he knows.	no
21834	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I don't tend to get an invitation	no
21835	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	No, no.	no
21836	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Uh, we don't have a active one but I'll make sure he's on the list.	no
21837	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
21838	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Should we	no
21839	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I don't know.	no
21840	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Should I call his office and see?	no
21841	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Uh, well i- it's uh -	no
21842	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	He	no
21843	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I mean, he's	no
21844	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
21845	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah, he was in	no
21846	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	He wasn't there at cof-	no
21847	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah, so this might be a conflict for him.	no
21848	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
21849	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	O_K.	no
21850	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
21851	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	O_K.	no
21852	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Uh, so.	no
21853	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah didn't he say his signal-processing class was like	no
21854	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I think he has a class. Yeah.	no
21855	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Tuesdays and Thursdays?	no
21856	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah. He might have.	no
21857	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Oh, O_K.	no
21858	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	You talking about David Gelbart?	no
21859	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Oh well, whatever.	no
21860	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
21861	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yes.	no
21862	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
21863	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
21864	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
21865	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah, I think he's taking two twenty-five A_ which is now.	no
21866	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	O_K.	no
21867	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So.	no
21868	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah. O_K.	no
21869	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
21870	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So, that's why we're not seeing him. O_K.	yes
21871	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Uh, transcriptions, uh, beyond the digits, where we are, and so on.	no
21872	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	O_K.	no
21873	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And the - and the recordings also, just where we are.	no
21874	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
21875	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Well,	no
21876	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	so um, should we - we don't wan- wanna do the recording status first, or - ?	no
21877	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Well, we have about thirty-two hours	no
21878	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	as of,	no
21879	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I guess a week and a half ago, so we probably now have about thirty-	no
21880	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And - and that's - that's uh - How much of that is digits?	no
21881	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	It's uh - that's including digits, right?	no
21882	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	That's including digits. I haven't separated it out so I have no clue how much of that is digits.	no
21883	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So -	no
21884	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
21885	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So anyway there's at least probably thirty hours, or something of -	no
21886	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	There's got to be more than thirty hour - i- it couldn't - of -	no
21887	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Of - of	no
21888	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Mmm.	no
21889	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Of non-digits.	no
21890	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah, absolutely. I mean, the digits don't take up that much time.	no
21891	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah, yeah.	no
21892	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	O_K.	no
21893	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	O_K, and the transcribers h- I, uh, don't have the exact numbers, but I	no
21894	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	think it would come to about eleven hours that are finished uh, transcribing from them right now.	no
21895	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	and then	no
21896	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	uh,	no
21897	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	systematic handling of numbers, and acronyms which I hadn't been specific about.	no
21898	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	"Um, for example, i- they'll say uh ""ninety-two"". And you know, so how - you could -"	no
21899	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Nine two, right.	no
21900	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	"e- Exactly. So if you just say ""nine two"", the - there are many s- ways that could have been expressed. An- and I just had them -"	no
21901	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I - I mean, a certain number of them	no
21902	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	but now we have a convention which also involves having it followed by, um, a gloss th- and things.	no
21903	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	You know, Jane?	no
21904	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Mm-hmm.	no
21905	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Um, one suggestion and you may already be doing this, but	no
21906	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I've noticed in the past that when I've gone	no
21907	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	through transcriptions and you know in - in order to build lexicons and things,	no
21908	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	if you um, just take all the transcriptions and separate them into words and then alphabetize them,	no
21909	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	a lot of times just scanning down that list you'll find a lot of	no
21910	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Misspelled.	no
21911	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
21912	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	You're talking about the type token frequency listings, and I use those too.	no
21913	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Y- you mean just uh	no
21914	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	It's one token from the - from the corpus.	no
21915	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.	no
21916	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah, those are e- extremely efficient and I- and I - I agree that's a very good use of it.	no
21917	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Oh so you already have that, O_K.	no
21918	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Well that's - that's a way - that's - You know, the	no
21919	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	basically	no
21920	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	you know colloquial spoken forms which aren't in the lexicon.	no
21921	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Mm-hmm. Cuz a lot of times they'll appear	no
21922	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
21923	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	and uh, i- in alphabetized	no
21924	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Absolutely. I agree.	no
21925	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	and - and so it makes it easier.	no
21926	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	That's a very good - that's a very good uh, suggestion.	no
21927	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And that was - that's	no
21928	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So there are numbers, then there are acronyms, and then um, there's a - he- she wants the uh, actually a -	no
21929	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	an explicit marker of what type of comment this is, so i- curly b- inside the curly brackets I'm gonna put either	no
21930	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	"""VOC"" for vocalized, like cough or like laugh or whatever,"	no
21931	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	"""NONVOC"" for door-slam, and ""GLOSS"" for things that have to do with - if they said a s- a spoken form with this - m- this pronunciation error. I already had that convention but I -"	no
21932	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Right.	no
21933	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Oh that's great.	no
21934	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I haven't been asking these people to do it systematically cuz I think it most - ha- most efficiently handled by uh - by a - a filter. That was what I was	no
21935	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	"you get a whole list of things that say ""curly bracket"	no
21936	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Mm-hmm.	no
21937	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	then y- you know it's - it's - You - you risk less error if you handle it by a filter,	no
21938	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	than if you have this transcriber ch- laboriously typing in	no
21939	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
21940	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So many ways that error prone.	no
21941	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Right.	no
21942	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Right.	no
21943	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So, um,	no
21944	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	and same thing with you know,	no
21945	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	when you do what	no
21946	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Mm-hmm.	no
21947	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Mm-hmm.	no
21948	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	You don't know what they could be.	no
21949	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah now TIMIT's clear um	no
21950	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
21951	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So how are you doing the -	no
21952	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I'd handle the numbers individually.	no
21953	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	How are you doing the uh, acronyms so if I say P_Z_M what would it appear on the transcript?	no
21954	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	O_K.	no
21955	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Mm-hmm.	no
21956	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Right.	no
21957	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I don't know if that's really necessary to do that.	no
21958	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	uh, a step away from i- indicating that it really is intentional that those spaces are there, and indicating why they're there to indicate that it's uh	no
21959	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Mm-hmm.	no
21960	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	you know,	no
21961	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Right. So it sounds good.	no
21962	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And so anyway, the clean - those are those things and then channelized is to then um, get it into this multichannel format.	no
21963	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And at	no
21964	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	But that's been my top priority - beyond getting it	no
21965	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Right.	no
21966	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And uh,	no
21967	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	uh s- s- speech-nonspeech segmentation um, up and running and I haven't - I haven't been able to use that yet cuz I'm working s- re- this is my top priority - get the data clean, and channelized.	no
21968	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I actually gave	no
21969	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Have you also been doing spot checks, Jane?	no
21970	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Okay, good.	no
21971	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	um actually um I have a segment of ten minutes that was transcribed by	no
21972	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Oh good. Good.	no
21973	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	and I went through it last night, it's - it's almost spooky how similar these are, word for word. And there are some differences in commas cuz commas I - I left them discretion at commas.	no
21974	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Right.	no
21975	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Uh - and so because it's not part of our st- of our ne-	no
21976	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Mm-hmm.	no
21977	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And um,	no
21978	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	and - so they'll be a difference in	no
21979	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	in - in	no
21980	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	"um, the one i- i- the colloquial speech person picked up ""gobbledy-gook"". And the other one didn't. And on"	no
21981	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Hmm.	no
21982	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Right.	no
21983	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	"When - for the person who missed ""gobbledy-gook"" what did they put?"	no
21984	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Oh.	no
21985	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So they tried to approximate it, but it was -	no
21986	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Oh good.	no
21987	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	it was spelled G_A_B_B_L -	no
21988	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Sort of how it sounds.	no
21989	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yes. More of an attempt to - I mean apparently it was very	no
21990	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
21991	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	It was a technical term that she didn't recognize,	no
21992	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
21993	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah. But she knew that she didn't know it. Maybe it was a technical ter- exactly. But she - even though her	no
21994	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	"courses in this area or if she's taken cognitive science courses then cuz ""neural nets"" and - oh she has some things that are - oh ""downsampled"", she got that right."	no
21995	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Right.	no
21996	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Hmm.	no
21997	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And some of these are rather	no
21998	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Obscure, yeah.	no
21999	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	But ch- ten solid uh - m- ch- s- chunk of ten solid minutes where they both coded the same data. And um -	no
22000	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And - and again the	no
22001	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yes exactly.	no
22002	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah, O_K.	no
22003	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And that's part of this -	no
22004	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Eleven hours.	no
22005	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Is that - is that - that including digits?	no
22006	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yes it is. Mm-hmm.	no
22007	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
22008	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So let's say roughly	no
22009	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I mean it's probably more than that but - but with - of - of non-digits.	no
22010	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	It'd be more than that because I - my recollection is the minutes - that da- digits don't take more than half a minute. Per person.	no
22011	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
22012	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Oh, O_K.	no
22013	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	But um	no
22014	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Oh, I see.	no
22015	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	But they haven't gotten to the end of that yet. So they're still working - some of them are - Two of them are still working on completing that.	no
22016	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Oh, I see.	no
22017	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
22018	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Boy,	no
22019	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah. They	no
22020	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
22021	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	There're some who have more hours that they devote to it than others. Yeah.	no
22022	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Mm-hmm.	no
22023	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Mm-hmm.	yes
22024	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So what - what - what's the deal with - with your -	no
22025	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	The channel u- thing?	no
22026	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
22027	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Oh, it's just uh, I ran the recognizer -	no
22028	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	it's just in uh - in this new multi-channel format and output, and	no
22029	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Oh, I see.	no
22030	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I just gave one - one meeting to - to Liz who wanted to - to try it for - for the recognizer	no
22031	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	as uh, apparently the recognizer had problems with those long chunks of speech, which took too much memory or whatever,	no
22032	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Right.	no
22033	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
22034	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	and so	no
22035	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Is this anything different than the H_M_M system you were using before?	no
22036	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
22037	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	No.	no
22038	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Uh,	no
22039	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I	no
22040	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Mm-hmm.	no
22041	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So there's still no -	no
22042	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	no knowledge using different channels at the same time. You know what I mean?	no
22043	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	There is some, uh as the energy is normalized across channels yeah.	no
22044	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Across all of them. O_K.	no
22045	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So. But basically that's one of the main changes.	no
22046	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Mm-hmm.	no
22047	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Mm-hmm.	no
22048	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	energy? You said you're trying some different features, or something.	no
22049	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Oh I just uh -	no
22050	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I just use um our loudness-based things now as they - before there were - they were some in - in the log domain and I - I changed this to the -	no
22051	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Cu- Cube root?	no
22052	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	to the -	no
22053	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
22054	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	To -	no
22055	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	No, I changed this to the - to the - to the loudness thingy with the - with the how do you call it? I'm not sure.	no
22056	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Hmm.	no
22057	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Ah.	no
22058	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	With the, uh -	no
22059	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Fletcher Munson?	no
22060	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	No.	no
22061	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I'm not sure about the term.	no
22062	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Oh, O_K.	no
22063	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Uh, I'll look it up.	no
22064	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah, alright.	no
22065	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Uh, O_K, and - Yeah. That's - that's basically the - the - the thing.	no
22066	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	O_K.	no
22067	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah, and I - and I tried t- to normalize uh -	no
22068	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	uh the features, there's loudness and modified loudness, um, within one channel,	no
22069	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	because they're,	no
22070	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	yeah to - to be able to distinguish between foreground and	no
22071	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And it works quite well. But, not always.	no
22072	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Uh-huh.	no
22073	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Uh-huh.	no
22074	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So.	no
22075	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	O_K.	no
22076	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Good.	no
22077	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Um, let's see.	no
22078	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I think the uh -	no
22079	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Were - were you basically done with the transcription part?	yes
22080	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Were - were you basically done with the transcription part?	no
22081	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So I guess the next thing is this uh - bleep editing.	no
22082	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Right. So the -	no
22083	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	The	no
22084	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	to give them an opportunity to bleep out sections they don't want. So I've written a bunch of tools that will generate web pages,	no
22085	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	uh	no
22086	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And then, it's a	no
22087	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And so, uh, some of the	no
22088	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
22089	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And so I thought about this a	no
22090	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And then each	no
22091	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And that way each	no
22092	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I - I can't help but wonder if this is maybe a little more elaborate than is needed. I mean if people have -	no
22093	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Uh, I mean, for	no
22094	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And then	no
22095	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Mm-hmm.	no
22096	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And, I -	no
22097	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	uh - I mean it depends how this really ends up working out, but I guess my thought was that the	no
22098	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	occasion of somebody wondering whether something was O_K or not and needing to listen to it	no
22099	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	was gonna be extremely rare.	no
22100	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	O_K.	no
22101	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And so that - that's a minor part of it, I just wanted some web interface so that people - you didn't actually have to send everyone the text.	no
22102	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So m- what my intention to do is that as the transcripts become	no
22103	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	um	no
22104	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	and just uh,	no
22105	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	"um, ""you need a password"". So th- th- question number one is how do we distribute the passwords,"	no
22106	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	and question number	no
22107	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I think what I was sort of saying is that if you just say	no
22108	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	"""here is a - here is -"""	no
22109	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I mean this maybe it sounds paleolithic but - but I just thought if you handed them some sheets of paper,	no
22110	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	"that said, uh, ""here's what was said in this transcription is it O_K with you?"	no
22111	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	and if it	no
22112	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I think that um there are a subset of people who will want printouts that we can certainly provide.	no
22113	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	But certainly	no
22114	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	ha- be able to just sit and leaf through it.	no
22115	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	You find it easier to go through a large - I mean how do you read books?	no
22116	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Well I certainly read books by hand. But for something like this, I think it's easier to do it on the web.	no
22117	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Really?	no
22118	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I mean, it -	no
22119	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Cuz you're gonna get, you know, if I - I'm - I'm in a	no
22120	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Going to a web site is easy, but flipping through a hundred pounds - a hundred pages of stuff is	no
22121	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Well, I don't think it's that much harder than, paper.	no
22122	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Really?	no
22123	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So.	no
22124	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So here's the way I was imagining it, and maybe I'm wrong, but the way I imagined it was that	no
22125	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
22126	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	"um, the largest set of people is gonna go ""oh yeah, I didn't say anything funny in that meeting just go ahead, where's the - where's the release?"""	no
22127	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And then there'll be a	no
22128	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	"who um, will say uh ""well, yeah, I really would like to see that."" And for them,"	no
22129	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	the easiest way to flip through, if it's a	no
22130	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I mean unless you're	no
22131	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
22132	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Um	no
22133	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	if - if uh	no
22134	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	you don't have search mechanisms you just sort of have this really, really long document, I mean whenever I've had a	no
22135	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I mean, so it's - it's - I mean, you - you're - you're not necessarily gonna be sitting at the desk all the time, you wanna figure you have a train ride,	no
22136	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	and there's all these situations where - where I -	no
22137	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I mean, this is how I was imagining it, anyway. And then I figured,	no
22138	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	that out of	no
22139	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	and then	no
22140	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	S- It seems like i- if I'm right in that,	no
22141	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	it seems like you're setting it up for	no
22142	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	the	no
22143	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So that uh, now we have to worry about privacy, we have to worry about all these passwords, for different people	no
22144	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Well, no fre- for the most -	no
22145	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	For the most frequent case they just say	no
22146	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And I think	no
22147	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Mm-hmm.	no
22148	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	The other thing too is it seems like - Go ahead.	no
22149	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Um,	no
22150	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	yeah, that's true.	no
22151	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I mean, cuz you don't	no
22152	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
22153	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I guess - Yeah, I guess we don't need their signature. I guess an email O_K is alright.	no
22154	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Oh that was another thing I - I had	no
22155	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	But	no
22156	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Are - are people going to be allowed to bleep out sections of a meeting where they weren't speaking?	no
22157	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yes.	no
22158	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I also - mm-hmm.	no
22159	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	If someone feels strongly enough about it,	no
22160	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	then I - I - I think they	no
22161	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Uh	no
22162	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So that means other people are editing what you say?	no
22163	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
22164	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I don't know about that.	no
22165	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I don't know if I	no
22166	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	"Well, the only other choice is that the person would say ""no, don't distribute this meeting at"	no
22167	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	But th-	no
22168	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	what they signed in the consent form,	no
22169	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	was something that said you can use	no
22170	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Well, but if -	no
22171	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Right?	no
22172	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	if someone is having a conversation, and you only bleep out one	no
22173	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
22174	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah, but that's	no
22175	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Um, I don't	no
22176	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I mean, because if I	no
22177	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	"""we were having a conversation, and I consider that conversation private,"""	no
22178	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	and I consider that your	no
22179	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	The - I agree that the consent forms were - uh, I cons- agree with what Adam's saying, that	no
22180	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	the consent form did leave open this possibility that they could edit things which they found offensive whe- whether they said them or didn't say them.	no
22181	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I see.	no
22182	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And the other thing is from the standpoint of the l- of the l- I'm not a law- lawyer, but it strikes me that	no
22183	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	O_K, well, if that's what it said.	no
22184	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So I think it's kind of nice to have this facility to	no
22185	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	by having a document they edited. But - but it seems to me that sometimes um,	no
22186	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	you know i- if a person had a bad day, and they had a tone in their voice that they didn't really like, you know it's nice - it's nice to be able to listen to it and be sure that that was O_K.	no
22187	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I mean I can certainly provide a printable version if people want it.	no
22188	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Um	no
22189	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Um.	no
22190	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	do their work primarily by sitting at the computer, flipping around the web, and others do	no
22191	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Others would consider it - this uh - a -	no
22192	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yep.	no
22193	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	a set of skills that they would have to gain.	no
22194	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	You know? It depends on what meetings.	no
22195	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Well I think most of the people in the meetings are the former.	no
22196	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	That's true.	no
22197	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So far.	no
22198	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So.	no
22199	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	In the meetings	no
22200	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yep.	no
22201	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	But we're trying to expand this, right?	no
22202	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So I - I - I actually think that paper is the more universal thing.	no
22203	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Right.	no
22204	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And that -	no
22205	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Mm-hmm. Yeah.	no
22206	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Well, but if they want to print it out that's alright. I think everyone in the meeting can access the web.	no
22207	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	No, I think	no
22208	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	O_K, so does that mean that I can't use email?	no
22209	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Or what?	no
22210	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Cuz you could send it through email you're thinking.	no
22211	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I - I th- well - we - there was this -	no
22212	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Well, I don't think I - well I don't think we can send the	no
22213	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Good. For security? Yeah, O_K good. Good point.	no
22214	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	No.	no
22215	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Right.	no
22216	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Um.	no
22217	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	"So giving them, you think a web site to say, ""if you wanna print it out here it is"", is not sufficient?"	no
22218	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
22219	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I-	no
22220	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Certainly for everybody who's been in the meetings so far it would be sufficient. I'm just wondering about -	no
22221	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah, I'm just thinking for people that that's not sufficient for, what - the only sufficient thing would be for me to walk up to them and	no
22222	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	You could mail it to them. Get an- a mailing address.	no
22223	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
22224	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Equivalent.	no
22225	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	But -	no
22226	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	But I think it's easier to drop in the box.	no
22227	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	"Just put the button on - on the web page which say ""please send me the - the scripts""."	no
22228	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Oh that's interesting.	no
22229	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	That's right.	no
22230	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
22231	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Mm-hmm.	no
22232	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And so can they bleep within an utterance?	no
22233	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	No. Whole utterances only.	no
22234	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Whole utterances.	no
22235	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And that was just convenience for my sake, that it's uh, uh	no
22236	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	it would end up being fairly difficult to edit the transcripts if we would do it at the sub-utterance level.	no
22237	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Because this way I can just delete an entire line out of a transcript file rather than have to do it by hand.	no
22238	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	There's another aspect to this which maybe -	no
22239	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	is part of why this is bothering me.	no
22240	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Um, I think you're really trying very hard to make this as convenient as possible for people to do this.	no
22241	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I mean that's why I did the web form, because for	no
22242	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Mmm.	no
22243	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I - I - I understand. I think	no
22244	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I know where you're going.	no
22245	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Oh.	no
22246	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Because nob- you know it -	no
22247	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	There was a - one or twi- once or twice, in the re- in the meetings we've heard, where somebody said something that they might be embarrassed by,	no
22248	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	but	no
22249	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	You know, this is - this - we're - we're covering - We're playing the lawyer's game, and we're playing- we're - we're - we're looking for the extreme case.	no
22250	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	If we	no
22251	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	That - I think that's -	no
22252	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I'm sort of psyching	no
22253	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I guess I don't see having a few phrases here and there in a meeting being that mu- much of a headache, bleeped out. So.	no
22254	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I think what Morgan's saying is the easier it is, the more is gonna be bleeped.	no
22255	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And - and it	no
22256	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I think some researchers who are gonna be working with this corpus years from now are really gonna be cursing the fact that there's a bunch of stuff in there	no
22257	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Mm-hmm.	no
22258	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	You know, it depends on the kind of research they're doing, but it might be, uh	no
22259	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
22260	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And, you know where it's	no
22261	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	we definitely want to allow the option of it being bleeped out. But I	no
22262	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And - and uh, I	no
22263	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	and they can bleep out stuff they don't	no
22264	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Well I don't see	no
22265	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
22266	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So that the -	no
22267	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	No, no, I - I - I don't -	no
22268	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	The	no
22269	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	You- you've talked me into	no
22270	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	The problem is if it's harder for them it's also harder for me.	no
22271	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Whereas this web interface, I just get email, it's all formatted, it's all ready to go and I can just insert it.	no
22272	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So maybe you don't give them access to the web interface unless they really need it.	no
22273	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Well I guess -	no
22274	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So - so - so I'm sorry - so -	no
22275	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah. Hmm.	no
22276	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	so -	no
22277	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So maybe this is a s- a way out of it.	no
22278	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	You've provided something that's useful for you to do -	no
22279	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	handle, and useful for someone else if they need it.	no
22280	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	But	no
22281	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Well -	no
22282	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I think the issue of privacy and ease and so forth should be that uh, they get access to this if they really need it.	no
22283	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So you're saying the - the sequence would be more like	no
22284	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	first Adam goes to the contact lists, contacts them via whatever their preferred method is, to see if they	no
22285	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Right.	no
22286	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And then if they	no
22287	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Well, to some extent I have to do that	no
22288	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	W- w-	no
22289	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	There's - there -	no
22290	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	y-	no
22291	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So,	no
22292	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	but you don't necessarily	no
22293	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Well, but -	no
22294	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So -	no
22295	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	what I'm	no
22296	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	No, no, no. But you aren't necessarily giving them -	no
22297	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So they have to	no
22298	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Right.	no
22299	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	But - we don't even necessarily need to end up distributing passwords at	no
22300	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Well, we do because of privacy. We can't just make it openly available on the web.	no
22301	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	No, no. You're missing the point.	no
22302	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	We're - We're trying i-	no
22303	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	We're trying to make it less of an obvious just l- l- l- l-	no
22304	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	uh fall off a log, to	no
22305	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Not everyone gets a password,	no
22306	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	unless they ask for it. Yeah.	no
22307	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Right?	no
22308	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So th- so what	no
22309	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	first you contact them and ask them if they would like to review it for to check for the - not just for fun,	no
22310	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	O_K? but to - to check this	no
22311	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	for uh things that they're worried about having said or if they're willing to just send an approval of it, at - from their memory.	no
22312	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Um - and, uh, and we should think carefully actually we should review - go through how that's worded, O_K?	no
22313	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Then, if someone uh - wants to review it,	no
22314	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	uh, and I know you don't like this, but I'm offering this as a suggestion, is that - is that we then give them a print out.	no
22315	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	"And then if they say that ""I have a potential problem with these things,"""	no
22316	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	"you - you say ""O_K well you might wanna hear this in context to s- think if you need that,"" you issue them a password, i- in the -"	no
22317	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	But the - the problem with what you're suggesting is it's not just inconvenient for them, it's inconvenient for me.	no
22318	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Because that means multiple contacts every time - for every single meeting every time anyone wants anything.	no
22319	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I would much	no
22320	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I know you'd	no
22321	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah. So I think you're thinking people are going to arbitrarily start bleeping and I just don't think that's gonna happen.	no
22322	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	that uh, it's - I th- I th- You know, if it turns out that something gets published in this corpus that someone really should have eliminated and didn't detect,	no
22323	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	then it could have been because of their own negligence that they didn't pursue that next level and get the password and do that, um,	no
22324	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	"but - but they might be able to argue ""oh well it was cumbersome, and I was busy and it was gonna take me too much time to trace it down"". So it could that the burden would come back onto us. So I'm a little bit worried about uh, making it harder for them, from the legal standpoint."	no
22325	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
22326	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	It seems to me that sending them email,	no
22327	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Uh-huh.	no
22328	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	"saying ""if you have an O_- O_K reply to this email and say O_K,"	no
22329	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	If you have a	no
22330	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	seems like is a perfectly, reasonable compromise. And if they want a printout they can print it out themselves.	no
22331	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
22332	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	um, my impression is that they - that we offered them at the very least that they definitely	no
22333	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
22334	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I mean I - I thought that you were - Maybe I misinterpreted what you said but it's -	no
22335	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Having it. Well the in - the consent form is right in there if anyone wants to look at it, so.	no
22336	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Giving it to	no
22337	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Alright. Fine. O_K. Fair enough.	no
22338	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
22339	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Sh- sh- well I could - I'm closer. I could -	no
22340	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	D- you want me to grab one?	no

22344	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I don't know -	no
22345	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I just meant that e- every - ev- any time you say anything to anyone there is in fact a - a bias that is presented, right? of - and -	no
22346	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Oh yeah yeah - oh I know.	no

22351	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Hmm.	no
22352	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Well that's more open than I realized.	no

22365	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah, O_K, so. wh- um - I think I have an idea that may be sat- may satisfy both you and me in this which is,	no
22366	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	um, it's a - it - we just go over carefully how these notes to people are worded.	no
22367	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So I - I just want it to be worded in such a way where it gives the strong impre- it gives very, I mean nothing	no
22368	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Right.	no
22369	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	That - that we really would	no

22371	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	if that is the	no
22372	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And I don't think there's anything in the legal aspects that - that is hurt by our expressing that bias.	no
22373	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Great. Great, great. Yeah. I agree.	no
22374	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And then - then my concern about - which - you know you might be right, it may be it was just paranoia on my part, uh but people just -	no
22375	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	See I'm	no
22376	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	It's just a check box next to the text, it's not any fun at all.	no
22377	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Well I don't know. I kind of had fun when you played me something that was bleeped out. You know.	no
22378	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	All - no because it doesn't automatically bleep it at the	no
22379	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Oh they won't?	no
22380	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Oh good. So you haven't made it so much fun.	no
22381	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Right.	no
22382	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Oh good. O_K,	no
22383	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	It just sends me the time intervals. And then at some point I'll incorporate them all and put bleeps.	no
22384	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I mean I don't wanna have t- ha- do that yet until we actually release the data because um, then we have to have two copies of every meeting and we're already short on disk space.	no
22385	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
22386	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no

22396	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Uh, fair enough.	no

22399	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
22400	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I'm - I'm - I'm - I thought - I - I thought about it with one of my background processes and I - uh it's - uh it's uh, it's fine to do the email.	no
22401	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I don't think so.	no
22402	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Ah.	no

22404	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	O_K.	no

22407	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah. And -	no
22408	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And so I	no
22409	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Well and furthermore I - it's now fairly routine in a lot of arrangements that I do with people on contracts and so forth that - that uh if it's - if it's that sort of thing where you're	no
22410	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	"you're saying uh ""O_K I agree, we want eighty hours of this person at such-and-such amount, and I agree that's O_K,"""	no
22411	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	uh if it's a follow up to some other agreement where there was a signature it's often done in email now so it's - it's O_K.	no
22412	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Right.	no
22413	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Great.	no
22414	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Um.	no
22415	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So I guess I probably should at the	no
22416	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	think about how to present it in a printed form.	no
22417	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I'm not really sure what's best with that. The problem is a lot of	no
22418	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	and so I don't necessarily wanna do one per line.	no
22419	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	But I don't know how else to do it.	no
22420	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I also have this - I - I think it's nice you have it uh, viewab- her-	no
22421	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	um, the non- nonverbal side, I mean I - I agree that our bias should be as - as expressed here, and - but	no
22422	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I - I think it's nice that a person could check. Cuz sometimes you know you - the words on a - on the page, come out soun- sounding different in terms of the	no

22424	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Mm-hmm.	no
22425	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Mm-hmm.	no
22426	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah I think actually - my opinion	no
22427	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	not good.	no
22428	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	You know, if - if there are lots of mumbles and parentheses and things like that.	no
22429	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Right.	no
22430	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	That was all mumbled? I think Microsoft is	no
22431	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
22432	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah exactly	no
22433	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Sorry transcribers.	no
22434	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Or - or	no

22440	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
22441	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah that's true.	no
22442	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Actually	no
22443	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yep, yep, that's right.	no
22444	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
22445	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So I don't know. I mean, I - I guess we're assuming that the transcript is a close enough approximation and that - that my double checking will be	no
22446	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Mm-hmm.	no
22447	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	But it - the - some- something might sometime, and they - uh - if - if it's something that they said, they might -	no
22448	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	i- i-	no
22449	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I mean, you might be very accurate in putting down what they	no
22450	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Mm-hmm.	no
22451	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	but, when	no
22452	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I don't know how to notate that.	no
22453	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah, that's right. Yeah that's right.	no
22454	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Sarcasm, how do you - how do you indicate sarcasm?	no
22455	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	No, I'm serious.	no
22456	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So - the - so - i- the - so we might - we might get some feedback from people that such-and-such was,	no
22457	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	you know, not - not really what I said.	no
22458	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
22459	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Well that would be good to get, definitely.	no
22460	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah, but,	no
22461	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah, sure.	no
22462	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Just for corrections.	no
22463	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
22464	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So um, in terms of password distribution, I think	no
22465	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
22466	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Or if for- leave it on their voice mail.	no
22467	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Any sub-word level thing.	no
22468	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Any sub-wor- Yeah, O_K.	no
22469	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I mean you could do it with P_G_P or things like that but it's too complex.	no
22470	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	You know I just realized something, which is of - e- th- this question about the - uh- the possible mismatch of -	no
22471	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I mean i- well, and actually also the lawyer saying that um, we shouldn't really have them - have the people	no
22472	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	believing that they will be cleared by our checks. You know?	no
22473	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I mean. So it's like i- in a way it's - it's nice to have the responsibility still on	no
22474	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Mm-hmm.	no
22475	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	listen to the tape and - and hear the transcript, to have that be the -	no
22476	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I mean,	no
22477	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	most people will not wanna take the time to do that, though.	no
22478	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah, O_K, fair enough.	no
22479	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And they're s- they're absorbing the responsibility themselves. So it's not - it's not um - Yeah, good.	no
22480	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And they - they have to -	no
22481	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	You probably won't listen to it.	no
22482	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
22483	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	It is true that tec- that the content is technical, I - and so i-	no
22484	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
22485	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	and we're not having these discussions which -	no
22486	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I - I mean, when	no
22487	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	in other people's speech or in my own.	no
22488	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah. You would think it would be rare, I mean we're not talking about the energy crisis or something, people have -	no
22489	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Just -	no
22490	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	It should be very rare.	no
22491	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah. Yeah, O_K.	no

22493	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no

22659	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Pre-crashed.	no
22660	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So it should be a really short meeting, I hope.	no
22661	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Uh, agenda items, number one, I wanna talk - since we were just discussing that - is microphone issues. What the heck are we gonna do about microphones?	no
22662	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So uh I got passed on that the E_D_U group doesn't like the	no
22663	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Oh.	yes
22664	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Oh.	no
22665	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	uh, Crown mikes.	no
22666	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Who does?	no
22667	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I do.	no
22668	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah, I do too.	no
22669	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So you guys need to start going to the E_D_U meetings.	no
22670	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I see.	no
22671	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah right.	no
22672	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	They don't work for me very well. I much prefer these.	no
22673	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	That's right.	no
22674	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yep. Um,	no
22675	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
22676	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Me too.	no
22677	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So do I.	no
22678	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I	no
22679	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Right.	no
22680	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Th- those are intimidating.	no
22681	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So apparently they - they like	no
22682	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	It has one good effect, that people are trying to get there early because the people who get there early get to pick the mike.	no
22683	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Interesting.	no
22684	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	People who show up late have to use	no
22685	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	um, we should probably get different mikes. So the question is, the easiest thing to do is certainly to just get two more, um,	no
22686	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Just two more of	no
22687	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	The other option is to try yet another mike.	no
22688	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Find one we like and potentially get	no
22689	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I have a question about this.	no
22690	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Are the auditory quality - Is it, uh, much different between this kind and the - the fancy ones?	no
22691	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Um,	no
22692	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	They are.	no
22693	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	O_K.	no
22694	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Those are better than the Sonys?	no
22695	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Have you -	no
22696	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
22697	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah, definitely.	no
22698	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Have you	no
22699	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
22700	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah?	no
22701	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
22702	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	O_K.	no
22703	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So, I mean, they're	no
22704	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Are they more directional, the microphones, as far as -	no
22705	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Um, they're more directional, a little better error - uh, noise cancellation, and also you can really get it right in front of your mouth, like this, whereas that one, to avoid breath noise, you really have to put it at - to the side.	no
22706	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	O_K.	no
22707	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So you seem to get better signal with this one.	no
22708	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	The other thing is, is it just a few people who don't like them in the E_D_U group? Cuz -	no
22709	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I don't know, but - you know, in - in sort of random polling	no
22710	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	L- Liz - Liz said something that leaves me believing that	no
22711	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	They are ver-	no
22712	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Gosh, cuz I	no
22713	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	It seems a shame t- to discard -	no
22714	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I mean, so s-	no
22715	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Right.	no
22716	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah, that's why I was saying if we could just unplug them and plug them in.	no
22717	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Well, I mean, that's the other option, is that we could switch the form so it's more obvious the distinction between channel and mike, um, and then get	no
22718	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	You know, pretty -	no
22719	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	duplicates. I mean, there's no problem with that. It's just - what -	no
22720	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Hmm.	no
22721	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Should we get just more	no
22722	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Which ones are those?	no
22723	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	b- the one you're wearing. Because it - it pinches -	no
22724	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	The one I'm wearing? Oh.	no
22725	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Those.	no
22726	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	pinches the	no
22727	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Oh.	no
22728	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I mean, so, if you	no
22729	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
22730	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I hate it because it's hard to adjust the	no
22731	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
22732	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	But I -	no
22733	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Right.	no
22734	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	reasonable, yeah.	no
22735	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Right.	no
22736	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So, I mean, we could try another mike.	no
22737	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	But then we have the wiring issue, and -	no
22738	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	But the problem is again the - the plug, or - ?	no
22739	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Wh-	no
22740	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	The plug is proprietary. So that's why I was saying getting more	no
22741	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	O_K.	no
22742	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	O_K.	no
22743	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	O_K.	no
22744	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
22745	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	O_K, n- now may- maybe I just don't know this but, um, are the only two possibilities from	no
22746	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yes.	no
22747	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So, the only possibilities from Sony are	no
22748	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I see. O_K.	no
22749	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	O_K.	no
22750	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Oh, I see.	no
22751	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So this isn't Sony. This is Crown. The one we're wearing.	no
22752	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Isn't that something. O_K.	no
22753	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	And so we had these wired for us.	no
22754	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Oh. I see. O_K.	no
22755	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Well, it s- It seems like right	no
22756	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	And so -	no
22757	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Huh, I remember that now.	no
22758	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I think that's probably the right first step is just get two more immediately, and have them available.	no
22759	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
22760	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	O_K.	no
22761	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	And then they can just unplug those from the -	no
22762	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Right.	no
22763	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	"And just make sure that you write down ""Crown"" or ""Sony"" on the mike number, which I'll change to mike type, or something like that."	no
22764	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	transmitter.	no
22765	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Mm-hmm.	no
22766	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Mm-hmm.	no
22767	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
22768	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	It might be good to double check at the end of the meeting too, cuz that would be an easy place for, uh, an error in the data.	no
22769	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yep.	no
22770	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	For it to be forgotten.	no
22771	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Well, it'll be me -	no
22772	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	It'll be whoever's setting up the meeting, who fills out the key file, so	no
22773	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	O_K, it's just - I'm just thinking that if - it'd be - yeah, but I know - but I mean to have the	no
22774	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	It has the same potential for error as everything else.	no
22775	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	No, no, we definitely would	no
22776	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Good, O_K.	no
22777	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Perfect.	no
22778	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Perfect, O_K.	no
22779	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	O_K, so we'll de- definitely go ahead and do that.	no
22780	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	How much is it just to buy the mike?	no
22781	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Couple hundred.	no
22782	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Really.	no
22783	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
22784	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Is that more or less than you thought?	no
22785	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	It depends on how good the mike is.	no
22786	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Oh that's	no
22787	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Oh, O_K.	no
22788	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
22789	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	For one of	no
22790	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Well the	no
22791	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	God.	no
22792	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Oops.	no
22793	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Wow!	no
22794	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	But.	no
22795	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Is there any educational discount?	no
22796	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah right.	no
22797	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	No.	no
22798	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Student discount.	no
22799	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah, good mikes are expensive. So.	no
22800	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	And when I was at Computer Motion we used Shure, the S_M-ten-A's, and I	no
22801	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Mm-hmm.	no
22802	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah, eighty or ninety for the Shures. So.	no
22803	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah. But they were - they seemed pretty good.	no
22804	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I mean, the	no
22805	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Oh.	no
22806	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Right, right.	no
22807	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So we should buzz	no
22808	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Ah, come on.	no
22809	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	We should keep a list of things we're gonna bleep out and the conditions under which -	no
22810	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Well, I'm just joking.	no
22811	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So, you do	no
22812	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Hmm.	no
22813	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Um.	no
22814	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Also, we're pro- I wanna double check with Morgan, he	no
22815	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So then all those red channels there would become wireless ones?	no
22816	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	And I'm -	no
22817	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
22818	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yep.	no
22819	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Cool.	no
22820	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yep.	no
22821	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Four more wireless.	no
22822	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Um.	no
22823	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	And also I'm gonna re-	no
22824	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	The Andrea mike?	no
22825	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
22826	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah, apparently it's had some problems.	no
22827	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	That's causing problems, yeah.	no
22828	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Which one is the Andrea mike?	no
22829	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	It was over here sometimes.	no
22830	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	A wired one?	no
22831	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	The - yeah a wired one.	no
22832	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah. It's uh -	no
22833	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Well, if you're gonna go to all wireless,	no
22834	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Oh, you mean in the meantime.	no
22835	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	This one.	no
22836	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	In the meantime, right, because uh -	no
22837	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Ah, I see.	no
22838	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
22839	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	it'll - it'll probably take a couple weeks to get it delivered from Sony anyway.	no
22840	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
22841	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I haven't - In the meetings that I recorded s-	no
22842	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So -	no
22843	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	It's always been at most six people, so I've never had to -	no
22844	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Oh really? Yeah.	no
22845	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Recently I haven't had to used any of the wired ones at all.	no
22846	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I guess cuz everyone's been out of town. Probably over the summer it'll be the same cuz it tends to be less,	no
22847	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
22848	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	fewer people.	no
22849	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Um,	no
22850	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	File -	no
22851	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Uh, done with microphone issues, I think?	no
22852	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Should we close the door?	no
22853	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	If you want.	no
22854	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Oh, I'm thinking - I don't know about the acoustics. That's - that's all I was wondering about.	no
22855	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	And this way we can get a door-slam in the uh - in the transcript file.	no
22856	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
22857	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah that's right, we gotta get the obligatory door-slam.	no
22858	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Oh well. No- not quite a slam.	no
22859	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	There's some knocks.	no
22860	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Get a special phone for that.	no
22861	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Mm-hmm.	no
22862	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Uh, the door-slam phone?	no
22863	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I guess, right, the door-slam phone.	no
22864	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
22865	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	You have a special phone?	no
22866	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	No, we could add one.	no
22867	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Oh, we could add one, yeah.	no
22868	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	And then we could have the	no
22869	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
22870	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	for - for when the phone rings.	yes
22871	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Um,	no
22872	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Uh, file reorganization.	no
22873	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	This is something we were talking about	no
22874	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	get ourselves a list of everything we wanna do to reorganize the file structure and anything else.	no
22875	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Can I - can I just mention something?	no
22876	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Sure.	no
22877	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Um, uh, I think the file regards reorganization. Also, um, another issue there is disk space probably, right? Um, so	no
22878	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Mm-hmm.	no
22879	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I know that the files that you've been cutting up for us	no
22880	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	f- for the recognition experiments, uh, one way - one really	no
22881	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Mm-hmm.	no
22882	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	brain -	no
22883	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	uh, brain-dead way of - of - of	no
22884	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	not causing any trouble, but saving disk space is to, uh, use the s- the	no
22885	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Sphere, the NIST, uh, W_encode program.	no
22886	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	to - to encode, you know, to compress them.	no
22887	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Shorten. Is that the same as shorten?	no
22888	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Uh, yeah, but it does it s- it happens so that the program that reads the waveforms does the unshortening transparently.	no
22889	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
22890	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Well, O_K, you mean it's built into the S_R_I, because we have the same thing with shorten in the	no
22891	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So.	no
22892	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Y- uh, I	no
22893	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	um,	no
22894	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So it's just a question of - of what decompression is built into your tools.	no
22895	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Well, it's -	no
22896	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	It's actually built into the Sphere library that NIST delivers, so - Right.	no
22897	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Oh really? I didn't know that.	no
22898	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	And actually, s- the sound tools	no
22899	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	For the -	no
22900	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	At least Feacalc doesn't.	no
22901	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	At least	no
22902	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Well, that's not a sound tool, right.	no
22903	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	But since - since these files are made to be used with the S_R_I recognizer,	no
22904	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	uh and the S_R_I front-end uses the Sphere library which in turn does this	no
22905	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	transparently	no
22906	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	um,	no
22907	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	uh, that will be a quick and -	no
22908	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	quick and easy way to just, uh, get you know, uh, be able to use more -	no
22909	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
22910	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Mm-hmm.	no
22911	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	The other thing I could do to relieve some of the pressure um is just move everything	no
22912	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	to my eighteen gig	no
22913	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	But that's gonna be only	no
22914	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Well,	no
22915	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I mean, I don't know -	no
22916	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I mean, you should do that too,	no
22917	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	probably, but - but as you do that you can also just run the -	no
22918	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah, it is kind of a temporary solution.	no
22919	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	To shorten everything.	no
22920	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	well, actually, the - th- what you do is you run -	no
22921	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Oh, now I have another use for the -	no
22922	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	The way I recently used it, and there might be better ways - So the program's called W_encode.	no
22923	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Mmm.	no
22924	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	And I think the type, y- you say um	no
22925	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I think dash T_ and then there are different -	no
22926	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	"different encoding methods, but if you wanna use the shorten one, you say d- ""minus T_ shorten"","	no
22927	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	and then the old	no
22928	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	uh wavefile and the	no
22929	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	wavefile, and then - Oops!	no
22930	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	"the shell ""AND"" operator or something."	no
22931	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Then I just move the	no
22932	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	new wavefile to the,	no
22933	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	you know, to the old	no
22934	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Right.	no
22935	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	wavefile, and then you have replaced the old one with one that behaves identically as long as your programs that use it know how to	no
22936	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Mm-hmm.	no
22937	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	decode it on the fly.	no
22938	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	And that -	no
22939	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	O_K.	no
22940	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	that just saved my butt because I actually was running - On a different experiment, I had	no
22941	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	segmented -	no
22942	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I was processing the whole Switchboard-two corpus, which is two hundred eighty hours of speech,	no
22943	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	and I was noticing, as I was	no
22944	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	almost finishing the processing, that I was running out of disk space.	no
22945	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Mm-hmm.	no
22946	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	And - and so	no
22947	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I uh had this flash of inspiration of just uh the same - the same disk had the segmented waveforms on them, so I -	no
22948	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Shortening everything on the fly.	no
22949	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	while this other thing was still going	no
22950	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	You had another process running that was shortening it. Yep.	no
22951	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Wow, wow!	no
22952	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	And low and behold I gained three g- three gig of space and um, you know -	no
22953	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Wow!	no
22954	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	"Did you have to re-nice one of the processes to make sure that ""shorten""?"	no
22955	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	No, no.	no
22956	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Wow.	no
22957	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	That must have been suspenseful.	no
22958	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	That was	no
22959	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	To be O_K.	no
22960	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	You know what would be a -	no
22961	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	u- I don't know if this would mess other things up, but -	no
22962	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	It seems like kind of a pain to have all these split up files around. What would be easier would be like pointers.	no
22963	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	The list, yep.	no
22964	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	"You know, lists like ""original wavefile, start, end""."	no
22965	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Start end.	no
22966	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	This is -	no
22967	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yep, the way	no
22968	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Right, the - the only reason we do this is because the - the S_R_I front-end doesn't have a way to - to um	no
22969	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	go into a l- a longer file with indices.	no
22970	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Um, so I - I suppose	no
22971	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	And segment on the fly.	no
22972	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	someone could try to put a hack like that into the -	no
22973	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	It would be easy.	no
22974	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	It wouldn't be hard at all. Someone just needs to d- sit down and do it who has some time.	no
22975	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So.	no
22976	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	But there's also some - I guess -	no
22977	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	And that way we wouldn't have multiple versions floating around. About the only difficulty with that is if it's	no
22978	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Then you really	no
22979	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	That's true.	no
22980	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Right? Because the pointers are -	no
22981	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Y- you don't know how much it's comp-	no
22982	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Well, is there - is there - is there a NIST routine which	no
22983	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	It doesn't compress it by a fixed amount.	no
22984	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Exactly. Right right right right right.	no
22985	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	can seek	no
22986	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	in a compressed file but with uncompressed indices?	no
22987	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I don't think so.	no
22988	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	And	no
22989	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	No, no. I mean, if you -	no
22990	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Th- the - the - the -	no
22991	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	If you can operate on the full -	no
22992	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	If you	no
22993	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Right.	no
22994	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	that extra	no
22995	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Right we - I mean the original	no
22996	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
22997	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Right.	no
22998	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Well, I mean, it just depends on how much disk space is a problem. I mean the - what you could do is decompress it to a temporary place and then operate on it and then delete it.	no
22999	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Right.	no
23000	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	But.	no
23001	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I mean, the segmentation also	no
23002	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Just silences, yeah.	no
23003	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	And if you have, you know, twenty channels and only five speakers, then it's -	no
23004	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	That's true.	no
23005	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Mm-hmm.	no
23006	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Well, assuming you'd - Yeah. Assuming that you then off-load the original	no
23007	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
23008	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Switchboard files.	no
23009	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So.	no
23010	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Mmm.	no
23011	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
23012	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Well, it seems like just shortening them is a good short-term solution so we don't have to do any coding.	no
23013	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah, yeah.	no
23014	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
23015	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	But I think - kind of - We've had - There was a big disk crash when you were gone and -	no
23016	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So.	no
23017	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	No, it was - I was still here. It was the day I left.	no
23018	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Oh was that the day you left?	no
23019	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	That's suspicious.	no
23020	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	He did it on purpose.	no
23021	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
23022	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Leave to Japan the day the disk crashes.	no
23023	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	No if I - if I had done it on purpose I would have timed it right	no
23024	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	But, um - Yeah so, Chuck helped me out in, uh, r-	no
23025	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	regenerating all the cha- the different channel files for like a few meetings - for like six meetings. So I think they're split up even further. It's kind of even more disorganized now since	no
23026	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Mm-hmm.	no
23027	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	we moved some of the meetings to different directories.	no
23028	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	They're on a different disk even, right?	no
23029	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Are they?	no
23030	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I think - you - didn't you expand them to X_E on Abbott?	no
23031	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	X_F.	no
23032	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	No, you - the ones that	no
23033	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Oh, different ones?	no
23034	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	You - the ones that you put them on when you put them on X_E.	no
23035	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I don't remember where I put them now.	no
23036	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I think you put them on X_E. So.	no
23037	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	O_K.	no
23038	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Well what we - what we found out was that um the disk that crashed	no
23039	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	was - it - w- with a - with a meta disk allocation, you had both c- t- transcripts and the shortened files and the expanded files were all on X_E - were on the same - sorry, different partitions of the same physical disk.	no
23040	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Physical disk.	no
23041	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Mmm.	no
23042	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	And it's conceivable I mean, I - I don't - I mean, so um, I was told that it's	no
23043	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Well, I think there was something else going on, because uh Dave Johnson said that D_D was getting accessed	no
23044	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Hmm.	no
23045	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Oh. Uh-huh.	no
23046	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Right? That data never gets touched, because we write it once and then we never touch it again.	no
23047	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Well, why not?	no
23048	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Oh sure it does.	no
23049	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah, after each meeting we copy the data to -	no
23050	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Except that -	no
23051	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Well, I mean, so the wavefiles, or - or anything at all, because the transcripts are there as well.	no
23052	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	The wave files.	no
23053	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I mean, he was saying gigabytes.	no
23054	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Oh, gigabytes. I see.	no
23055	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	And so, it has to be the wave files.	no
23056	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah, there	no
23057	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah, that's right.	no
23058	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah, so I asked Dave about it and he hasn't looked into it yet, but we should definitely double check on it.	no
23059	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah like - like the same	no
23060	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	meeting - shortened, files that we pull off of Popcorn when we're done doing the recording,	no
23061	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
23062	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	looked,	no
23063	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	to the	no
23064	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	you know, every single	no
23065	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Every night.	no
23066	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Is that right.	no
23067	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	i- for - f- you know, a week in a	no
23068	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	That's	no
23069	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Wow.	no
23070	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So at any rate, so for file reorganization we need to	no
23071	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
23072	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So I'm not sure who isn't involved with that. I mean, certainly me, Chuck and Jane. Anyone else	no
23073	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	And I - and I'd like, in terms of the conventions, to also, uh, you know, s- send a bit to Dan Ellis to see if it's - if there's any - get his input on it. I don't think - I don't think that'll be - Yeah.	no
23074	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	No.	no
23075	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Right.	no
23076	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So, maybe we should do that	no
23077	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
23078	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
23079	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
23080	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
23081	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Maybe n- next week if we	no
23082	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	O_K.	no
23083	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah sure. I'd like to -	no
23084	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So just update all the naming conventions and	no
23085	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	put all the files where they really belong, on one disk,	no
23086	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	That sounds like a good idea.	no
23087	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	and then leave - leave everything in place until the back-up - until the next full back-up and then delete the old ones.	no
23088	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Mm-hmm.	no
23089	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	O_K, now - and you're just - you're not talking about the s- the X_ disks - the X_ uh partitions, just the backed up space, or - ?	no
23090	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So.	no
23091	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Well,	no
23092	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	O_K.	no
23093	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So um,	no
23094	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	various paths, th- I mean this is why we have to do it in a synchronized way, because um	no
23095	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I think we should also at the same time try to, uh, convert over to your new naming conventions.	no
23096	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yes,	no
23097	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	exactly. That too.	no
23098	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	That'd be good.	no
23099	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So that's what I was saying. We need to get a list of all that stuff that we wanna do.	no
23100	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
23101	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	O_K.	no
23102	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	And so	no
23103	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I didn't really get any responses from the naming conventions that I sent out, so I assume that's alright with everyone.	no
23104	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I actually haven't looked at it yet. I haven't had a chance, so.	no
23105	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	No.	no
23106	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Hmm.	no
23107	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I haven't either. Sorry.	no
23108	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Oh.	no
23109	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I will by next	no
23110	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Uh, I don't know about the naming, I mean,	yes
23111	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I will by next	no
23112	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Uh, I don't know about the naming, I mean,	no
23113	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	O_K.	no
23114	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Then I should have made that as an agenda item.	no
23115	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Th- so these names that we've been using so far are with uh	no
23116	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	uh	no
23117	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	uh	no
23118	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I wouldn't just wanna change them	no
23119	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	you know, without some advance notice.	no
23120	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Right.	no
23121	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I mean, th- that's all these	no
23122	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
23123	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah, I'm -	no
23124	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	until we have some closure on some of the things we are currently	no
23125	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Right.	no
23126	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	dealing with, so -	no
23127	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Well, I mean, how	no
23128	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Right.	no
23129	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Well,	no
23130	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So.	no
23131	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	You're talking about different files.	no
23132	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I mean, it should probably be -	no
23133	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yep.	no
23134	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	yeah, I kind of agree with Andreas, like I'm a little bit -	no
23135	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I mean, these -	no
23136	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I	no
23137	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Well, if we -	no
23138	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	If	no
23139	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	This -	no
23140	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	No but I think just to be consistent we should also, I mean, have the same conventions, just in case you want -	no
23141	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Right.	no
23142	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah. So you - but you can switch that any time you want, right?	no
23143	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's only gonna affect my work. So.	no
23144	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah, it's not gonna -	no
23145	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I mean, if we -	no
23146	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I assume you're not gonna go, like, into, you know,	no
23147	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Right.	no
23148	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I - Actually I was gonna do a global search-replace on all entries at -	no
23149	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	at ICSI to change M_R to M_R_M at all places at ICSI.	no
23150	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah, that'd be great.	no
23151	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Really enjoy that.	no
23152	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	With no - with no advance warning.	no
23153	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Y- you -	no
23154	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Well, maybe I shouldn't say that on re- record.	no
23155	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	O_K.	no
23156	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	There was a	no
23157	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	typo in some of the contracts that Morgan got that someone,	no
23158	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	"one of our sponsors, did a global sear- search and replace for - between ""sponsor"" and"	no
23159	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Mm-hmm.	no
23160	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	And so, it - it was saying, uh -	no
23161	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Well, anyway, I won't -	no
23162	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah, one - one can imagine that that might be problematic.	no
23163	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I'm not sure whether that's right.	no
23164	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah, one can imagine the problems that that would	no
23165	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	But this - this name change affects a subset, doesn't need to reflect everything, yeah.	no
23166	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So.	no
23167	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Right.	no
23168	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Right.	no
23169	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Um,	yes
23170	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Thilo, you had - you wanted to talk about the -	no
23171	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah, I had one - one short point. I have just installed a Transcriber version on one of our N_T machines so it's available under Windows now.	no
23172	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Oh great. Actually someone - I just got an email this week from someone as-	no
23173	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Isn't that great?	no
23174	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah I re- responded to sh- I have already responded to him. I - I don't know what - what - what he - what the problem was. It was really straightforward, really easy.	no
23175	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	To Anant?	no
23176	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	And this is not - Mm-hmm.	no
23177	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Oh, I'm sorry, I - I just - So, who did you talk to?	no
23178	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	There was some - some guy from S_R_I who wanted to - to install - Yeah.	no
23179	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Anant?	no
23180	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Anant Venkataraman? O_K.	no
23181	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
23182	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	And he sent an email that he couldn't - couldn't install it and I - I just described him, well, what I did and it was really straightforward, so.	no
23183	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah, O_K. Great.	no
23184	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah, O_K.	no
23185	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Great. Great. Thanks. Thanks.	no
23186	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	And this is not just the Transcriber, this is the Channeltrans, right?	no
23187	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah, it's the Channeltrans, so the -	no
23188	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
23189	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah, excellent.	no
23190	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	the	no
23191	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Cool.	no
23192	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	things that Dave Gelbart -	no
23193	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Excellent.	no
23194	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So you should probably talk to a Sys Admin and get it put in some central place.	no
23195	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So that it'll work on all the N_T machines.	no
23196	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Well, I mean, as it stands, I - I guess - yeah I see what you mean. It'll - it'll be on the - on the UNIX side but accessible through the H_drive. Yeah.	no
23197	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	O_K.	no
23198	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I've -	no
23199	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Right.	no
23200	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	O_K. Yeah. I could do that.	no
23201	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So I assume Tcl-T_K wasn't already on the machine, so you had to install it. Yeah.	no
23202	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I had i- to install it, yeah.	no
23203	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Huh. Yeah.	no
23204	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Uh	yes
23205	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Huh. Yeah.	no
23206	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So Andreas, would it be appropriate to ask how the experiments are going?	no
23207	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Uh -	no
23208	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Oh, well, yeah I - I - I actually wasn't sure whether this is the right meeting for it, because it has uh very little to do with - with	no
23209	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Hmm.	no
23210	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	um some recognition experiments with ICSI	no
23211	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Um	no
23212	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Uh, and - and you know, this is the j- joint work with Chuck, and uh,	no
23213	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	um.	no
23214	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So, first,	no
23215	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	uh, you know, we had -	no
23216	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	we figured out sometime last week how to	no
23217	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	um -	no
23218	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	and - and Chuck wrote this really nice little	no
23219	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	script - Perl script that	no
23220	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	takes a uh waveform, runs the feature calculation	no
23221	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	and then dumps it out into the - into um	no
23222	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	a f- c- so-called	no
23223	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	uh cepstra file, which is what the S_R_I system uses to read features. It's essentially uh	no
23224	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	uh NIST headered	no
23225	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	uh waveform. You know, it looks like a waveform except instead of samples you have	no
23226	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Hmm.	no
23227	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Mm-hmm.	no
23228	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	And um that's all done	no
23229	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	um	no
23230	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	by the script, and it works great. And	no
23231	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	uh I first trained up two	no
23232	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	systems, because it's gender-dep- you know, the S_R_I system is gender-dependent so to be comparable, I trained uh um on a sh- on a so-called short training set	no
23233	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	um	no
23234	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	a male system and a female system,	no
23235	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	and	no
23236	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	uh also for debugging purposes, and for the heck of it, I trained um -	no
23237	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	trained uh on the same training set uh a standard system with the	no
23238	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	um, and compared the two -	no
23239	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So, w- what features did you use?	no
23240	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Well, we used, uh, twelve P_L_P uh, uh -	no
23241	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So not RASTA, just P_L_P.	no
23242	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Just P_L_P.	no
23243	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Just P_L_P and actually that - uh, one of the questions I had was what the RASTA would possibly buy us. But um, we'll	no
23244	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	talk about that later. So, the uh - so the baseline system - w- the S_R_I system was - uh used - uh also uh uh used t- twelve uh mel - uh mel cepstra	no
23245	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	um	no
23246	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	um analysis.	no
23247	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Um	no
23248	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I do	no
23249	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	know what - So the f- the bandwidth of the um	no
23250	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Thirty-seven fifty.	no
23251	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	And I do not know what the um	no
23252	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	ICSI um	no
23253	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	front-end would do. I mean, what the bandwidth is.	no
23254	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Um,	no
23255	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	but the results are such that uh, let's see -	no
23256	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	There's one other slight difference, right? Or two -	no
23257	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Oh yeah. So the S_R_I system also does um	no
23258	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	vocal tract length normalization and we couldn't figure out how to do that yet with the ICSI features. So that's one difference. And the other difference is that	no
23259	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	in the, uh -	no
23260	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	in the S_R_I system,	no
23261	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	the uh th- the first - the C_zero, the energy uh feature is normalized slightly differently from the rest. And what they do is	no
23262	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Huh.	no
23263	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	they d- they subtract the maximum -	no
23264	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	For each waveform segment	no
23265	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	they subtract the maximum of - of th- over that waveform segment from	no
23266	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	from the values of - for that waveform.	no
23267	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Which is a kind of automatic gain control, that is localized -	no
23268	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Do they subtract the max from each i- one or do they subtract each one from the max?	no
23269	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	They subtract -	no
23270	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Doesn't matter?	no
23271	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	No, just would be a sign change.	no
23272	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Except you get a lot of negatives the other way.	no
23273	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Right,	no
23274	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So it's their kind of two stage normalization.	no
23275	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Oh!	no
23276	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Oh!	no
23277	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Um now, I understand that the common practice	no
23278	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Um.	no
23279	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	For the C_zero.	no
23280	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Right. But in what	no
23281	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	conversation side.	no
23282	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So	no
23283	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	um since both S_R_I and ICSI use this sort of local normalization for C_zero that's presumably, you know, someone has done some experiments to - and found out that that works better.	no
23284	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Um, so that's another difference, and that might account for some of the	no
23285	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	discrepancies in the results. Um, but you know. So the	no
23286	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	the	no
23287	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Where should I start? Uh	no
23288	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	the -	no
23289	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So there's a two -	no
23290	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Oh. I tried it	no
23291	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So	no
23292	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	and with	no
23293	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	How many iterations?	no
23294	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	For the adaptation?	no
23295	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Mm-hmm.	no
23296	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Well, y- we always do three E_M iterations to	no
23297	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	O_K.	no
23298	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	and it's - it's this - it's this quick and dirty -	no
23299	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	the	no
23300	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	idea of what you could gain with it.	no
23301	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	And then, you know, so we have the	no
23302	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	the S_R_I front-end	no
23303	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	and the ICSI front-end	no
23304	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	and other than that the system configuration was identical. So it was the same -	no
23305	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	They came up with um	no
23306	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	you know, same number of uh Gaussians per state cluster	no
23307	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Um, same - The clustering used the same information loss threshold, which actually led to roughly the same number of Gaussians overall. So that the system configuration is - is comparable.	no
23308	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Um, and the -	no
23309	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Uh, so	no
23310	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	you had forty-nine p-	no
23311	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	That's error rate or recognition rate?	no
23312	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	This is error rate	no
23313	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	in percent.	no
23314	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	And	no
23315	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	with adaptation	no
23316	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	it's forty-seven point one	no
23317	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	and	no
23318	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	this - this was fifty-two point six.	no
23319	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	and	no
23320	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	fifty-one point three	no
23321	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Hmm.	no
23322	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	and then, when I combined them - I can actually combine them with	no
23323	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	something like ROVER. It's actually more sophisticated than ROVER but it's -	no
23324	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Um, here I got	no
23325	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	forty-eight point five	no
23326	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	and here I got forty-six point five.	no
23327	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So this is just combination at the utterance level.	no
23328	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Um.	no
23329	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	At the utterance level, right.	no
23330	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Why do you think the ICSI front-end is so much	no
23331	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Good	no
23332	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	That seems really odd to me.	no
23333	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Um, so, one percent I would attribute to the lack of V_T_L, about one percent. O_K.	no
23334	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Oh right. Right, right, right.	no
23335	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	O_K. Ah O_K.	no
23336	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	And then maybe another up - I don't know how much the C_zero normalization business really matters I can't it see, I mean can't see it - the	no
23337	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Ca- can you run the S_R_I - Just as an experiment, run the S_R_I front-end without vocal tract norma- normalization, and see how much difference it makes?	no
23338	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I	no
23339	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I could certainly do that. Yeah.	no
23340	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Um.	no
23341	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	We could	no
23342	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
23343	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	If we could figure out how.	no
23344	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
23345	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	and just try them with the ICSI	no
23346	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	uh front-end. Because we already have the capability to apply the warping to the um -	no
23347	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	to the P_L_P c-	no
23348	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah, Dan added that in, but -	no
23349	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah, but the -	no
23350	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So.	no
23351	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	They won't -	no
23352	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	they don't correspond one-to-	no
23353	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	No, but they	no
23354	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I mean the -	no
23355	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Anyway. But I can certainly try the S_R_I front-end without uh V_T_L. That sh- that's - that's certainly quick to do.	no
23356	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
23357	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Um	no
23358	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	and so -	no
23359	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah, and - and then there's all these um -	no
23360	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	You know, the number of um -	no
23361	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	You know, this	no
23362	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	u- had a fair amount of experimentation going into it. You know, how many	no
23363	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Mm-hmm.	no
23364	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	filter banks do you use, what - what bandwidth do you use, and stuff like that. And uh we could play the same kind of games with the	no
23365	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Right.	no
23366	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Uh, actually, the	no
23367	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	uh	no
23368	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	uh that hurt us. So this is, um - And this is - We've now used roughly what everybody else is using. So	no
23369	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Hmm.	no
23370	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	um, there's some room for improvements, I figure, in this - in the ICSI front-end.	no
23371	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Um.	no
23372	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So.	no
23373	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	But the good news is that even with this - with the ICSI system being that much	no
23374	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So that gives some hope for the future.	no
23375	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Um.	no
23376	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Unfortunately however this seems to be reduced with adaptation, so.	no
23377	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Um.	no
23378	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Also interestingly	no
23379	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	the -	no
23380	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Um, the difference actually	no
23381	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	um, for instance,	no
23382	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	um	no
23383	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	remove some of the um -	no
23384	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	You know, som- If you - if you have some - some difference in the front-end processing that	no
23385	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	uh is suboptimal, but can be possibly remedied by you know moving the	no
23386	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	um	no
23387	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	moving the models around. But - but apparently that doesn't -	no
23388	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	doesn't really - actually the difference becomes larger, so.	no
23389	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Um. Anyway. So right now what I'm doing is um -	no
23390	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Uh well, there's several things going on. One is that Chuck is working on uh getting the tandem features um into a form that we can train the tandem - the system on the tandem features. So that would actually be the	no
23391	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	more	no
23392	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Um, the other thing is I'm training	no
23393	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	uh retraining the models on the large training set that we usually use to build our evaluation models and then we can -	no
23394	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Right.	no
23395	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	And I actually	no
23396	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	do the	no
23397	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	um	no
23398	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Uh and um -	no
23399	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	What about ta-	no
23400	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	concatenating the two feature vectors into a single one?	no
23401	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	It gets pretty big.	no
23402	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	It	no
23403	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Hmm.	no
23404	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	And m- my experience with that in Broadcast News was usually combining at other levels works better.	no
23405	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Hmm.	no
23406	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So.	no
23407	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	For - for whatever that's worth.	no
23408	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Oh, you tried that on Broadcast News? Concatenating	no
23409	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Oh yeah.	no
23410	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
23411	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So w- Yep.	no
23412	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	different feature sets? Yeah.	no
23413	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Did you try uh -	no
23414	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	It was mostly M_S_G, P_L_P, RASTA.	no
23415	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I see.	no
23416	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So, you know, the feature sets we had available. And it was almost always better to combine at the probability level. You know, so we'd run the neural nets and combine the probabilities.	no
23417	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I see.	no
23418	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	O_K.	no
23419	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Alright.	no
23420	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Oh.	no
23421	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah, and it	no
23422	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yep.	no
23423	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	blow up the	no
23424	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	You'd also have to do some sort of normalization afterwards	no
23425	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	uh -	no
23426	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	so that they're uh orthogonal.	no
23427	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Right.	no
23428	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So you'd wanna do a linear transform also.	no
23429	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Right.	no
23430	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Um	no
23431	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	so	no
23432	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	the - Yeah, and then we could start experimenting a little bit to try to get the ICSI front-end to perform better.	no
23433	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Um. And - and as a preliminary just sort of diagnostic experiment we can - I can certainly run a S_R_I system without V_T_L	no
23434	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yep.	no
23435	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	just uh to get -	no
23436	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Wi- without what? Without V_T_L. O_K.	no
23437	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Just -	no
23438	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Vocal tract thing, yeah.	no
23439	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Wh- Yeah.	no
23440	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	And that - that's quick to do.	no
23441	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So.	no
23442	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I was thinking about	no
23443	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	tandem system - Well, let's not talk about it here, but I had some thoughts about the tandem system.	no
23444	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	yeah so but things are moving ahead, so	no
23445	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	O_K, should we do digits?	yes
23446	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Digits. Sure.	no
23447	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Do we have any other topics?	no
23448	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	O_K, let's do them one at a	no
23449	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Poetic reading of digits.	no

23512	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Sorry, start over.	no
23513	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	one eight one four two eight two four five four	yes
23514	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	You can really tell from the prosody where it goes.	no
23515	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	s- meeting. I actually have one more thing that - I don't know if it's - i- if - if it's allowed to - to bring up after the dis-	no
23516	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	After digits, I don't know.	no
23517	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Anyway.	no
23518	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	But it might be important. For um - So Liz remarked that she had recorded a meeting where	no
23519	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Go ahead.	no
23520	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	it was later found that several of the	no
23521	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	s- microphones were turned off, um	no
23522	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Mm-hmm.	no
23523	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	and this must become a problem especially with non-speech-meetings.	no
23524	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So um	no
23525	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	is there a way that the software could warn you if it gets zeros from	no
23526	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	some of the channels, or - ?	no
23527	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Probably. We could probably build that in to the front-end.	no
23528	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Because it - you know it's really annoying if you go through all that trouble and then basically the meetings aren't useable because uh even -	no
23529	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	What are people doing, they're switching their mikes off or something?	no
23530	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I don't	no
23531	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I don't know, uh eh. Fff.	no
23532	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	What would you like it to	no
23533	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Well, no, if - if you um - I mean obviously you always -	no
23534	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I mean, there's never gonna be a signal from all the channels, right? because - or	no
23535	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Um.	no
23536	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	But uh.	no
23537	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Well if an unblacked out channel is zero, is actually spitting out zeros, you can be pretty sure it's	no
23538	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Right.	no
23539	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Because it doesn't spit out zeros, it spits out epsilons.	no
23540	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Right? Cuz there's little background noise. The question is, when the software	no
23541	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Exactly.	no
23542	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	That's a good	no
23543	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I mean, it - it - it -	no
23544	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	We - we	no
23545	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Right.	no
23546	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Right. So maybe it's just to admonish people to actually look at the screen at the beginning of the meeting to make sure they get a signal.	no
23547	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yep.	no
23548	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Test -	no
23549	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Turn off the screen saver during the meeting.	no
23550	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Tell them to test their mikes, or -	no
23551	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah, something.	no
23552	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I think they sh-	no
23553	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah, I d- I don't know what to do other than -	no
23554	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	It - it can beep if one of the channels dies while recording.	no
23555	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	There's no sound out right now.	no
23556	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Oh.	no
23557	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Never mind.	no
23558	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	It should give the electric shock to the person recording the meeting.	no
23559	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yep. Yep. Yeah yeah. That would be good. Well, we can think about what to do about it, but it -	no
23560	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Oh yeah. That's a good one.	no
23561	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Wow, that's not a bad idea.	no
23562	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah. O_K.	no
23563	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	It's pretty clear we	no
23564	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah. Alright.	no
23565	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	O_K. Are we done?	no
23566	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	yes
23567	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Oh.	no
23568	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So, uh -	no
23569	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Alright.	no
23570	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Um, so I wanted to discuss digits briefly,	no
23571	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Oh good.	no
23572	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	but that won't take too long.	no
23573	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
23574	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K, agenda items,	no
23575	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Uh, we have digits,	no
23576	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	What else we got?	no
23577	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	New version of the presegmentation.	no
23578	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	New version of presegmentation.	no
23579	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Um,	no
23580	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	do we wanna say something about the,	no
23581	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah, why don't you summarize the -	no
23582	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	an update of the, uh, transcript?	no
23583	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Update on transcripts.	no
23584	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And I guess that includes some -	no
23585	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	the filtering for the,	no
23586	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	the A_S_I refs, too.	no
23587	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Mmm.	no
23588	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Filtering for what?	no
23589	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	For the references that we need to go from the -	no
23590	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	the	no
23591	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	It'll - it'll be - basically it'll be a re-cap of a meeting that we had jointly this morning.	no
23592	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Uh-huh.	no
23593	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	With Don, as well.	no
23594	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Mm-hmm.	no
23595	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Got it.	no
23596	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Anything else more pressing than those things? So -	yes
23597	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Anything else more pressing than those things? So -	no
23598	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So, why don't we just do those. You said yours was brief, so -	no
23599	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K.	no
23600	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K well, the, w- uh	no
23601	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	as you can see from the numbers on the digits we're almost done.	no
23602	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	The digits goes up to	no
23603	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Um,	no
23604	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	and so, uh,	no
23605	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	we probably will be done with the T_I-digits in,	no
23606	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	um, another couple weeks.	no
23607	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	um, depending on how many we read each time.	no
23608	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So there were a bunch that we skipped.	no
23609	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	You know, someone fills out the form and then they're not at the meeting and so it's blank.	no
23610	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Um, but those are almost all filled in as well.	no
23611	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And so, once we're - it's	no
23612	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So we'll have a corpus that's the size of T_I-digits?	no
23613	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And so -	no
23614	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	One particular test set of T_I-digits.	no
23615	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Test set, O_K.	no
23616	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So, I - I extracted,	no
23617	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Ther- there was a file sitting around which people have used here as a test set.	no
23618	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	It had been randomized and so on and that's just what I used to generate the order.	no
23619	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Oh! Great.	no
23620	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	of these particular ones.	no
23621	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Great.	no
23622	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Um -	no
23623	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So, I'm impressed by what we could do,	no
23624	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Is take the standard training set for T_I-digits, train up with whatever, you know,	no
23625	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	great features we think we have, uh for instance,	no
23626	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	and then test on uh this test set.	no
23627	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And presumably uh it should do reasonably well on that, and then, presumably, we should go to the distant mike, and it should do poorly.	no
23628	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
23629	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
23630	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And then we should get really smart over the next year or two, and it - that should get better.	no
23631	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And inc- increase it by one or two percent, yeah.	no
23632	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah,	no
23633	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
23634	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Um, but,	no
23635	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	in order to do that we need to extract out the actual digits.	no
23636	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
23637	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Um,	no
23638	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	so that - the reason it's not just a transcript is that there're false starts, and misreads, and miscues and things like that.	no
23639	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And so I have a set of scripts and X_Waves where you just select the portion,	no
23640	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	hit R_,	no
23641	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	um, it tells you what the next one should be,	no
23642	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	and you just look for that.	no
23643	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	You know, so it - it'll put on the screen,	no
23644	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	"""The next set is six nine,"	no
23645	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	"nine two two""."	no
23646	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And you find that,	no
23647	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	and,	no
23648	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	hit the key and it records it in a file in a particular format.	no
23649	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So is this -	no
23650	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And so the -	no
23651	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	the	no
23652	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Well, some of us. I've been do- I've done,	no
23653	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	eight meetings, something like that,	no
23654	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	just by hand.	no
23655	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Just myself, rather.	no
23656	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So it will not take long.	no
23657	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Um -	no
23658	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Uh, what - what do you think?	no
23659	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	My feeling is that- we discussed this right before coffee and I think it's a - it's a fine idea partly because, um, it's not un- unrelated to their present skill set,	no
23660	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	but it will add, for them, an extra dimension, it might be an interesting break for them. And also it is contributing to the, uh,	no
23661	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	c- composition of the transcript cuz we can incorporate those numbers directly and it'll be a more complete transcript. So I'm - I think it's fine, that part.	no
23662	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	There is - there is -	no
23663	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So you think it's fine to have the	no
23664	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Mm-hmm.	no
23665	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah, O_K.	no
23666	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	There's one other small bit, which is just entering the information which at s- which is at the top of this form,	no
23667	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Good.	no
23668	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	onto the computer,	no
23669	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	to go along with the - where the digits are recorded automatically.	no
23670	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
23671	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And so it's just,	no
23672	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	you know, typing in name, times - time, date, and so on.	no
23673	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Um, which again either	no
23674	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	but it is, you know,	no
23675	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	firing up an editor,	no
23676	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	or,	no
23677	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	again, I can do.	no
23678	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Or someone else can do.	no
23679	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And, that, you know, I'm not,	no
23680	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	that - that one I'm not so sure if it's into the - the,	no
23681	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	things that,	no
23682	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I,	no
23683	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	wanted to use the hours for, because the,	no
23684	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	the time that they'd be spending doing that they wouldn't be able to be putting more words on.	no
23685	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Mmm.	no
23686	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	But that's really your choice, it's your -	no
23687	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So are these two	no
23688	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Or do they have to happen at the same time before -	no
23689	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	No they don't have - this -	no
23690	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	you have to enter the data	no
23691	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	you do the second task, but they don't have to happen at the same time.	no
23692	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So it's - it's just I have a file whi- which has this information on it,	no
23693	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K.	no
23694	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	and then when you start using my scripts,	no
23695	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	for extracting the times,	no
23696	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	it adds the times at the bottom of the file.	no
23697	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And so, um,	no
23698	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I mean, it's easy to create the files and leave them	no
23699	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Oh, O_K.	no
23700	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Um,	no
23701	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	it's - it's	no
23702	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	to make sure you're entering for the right person.	no
23703	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	But,	no
23704	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	either way.	no
23705	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
23706	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah just by way of uh, uh, a uh,	no
23707	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	order of magnitude, uh,	no
23708	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	um, we've been working with this Aurora, uh data set.	no
23709	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And, uh, the best score,	no
23710	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	on the,	no
23711	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh, is about, uh -	no
23712	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I think the best score was something like five percent,	no
23713	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh, error, per digit.	no
23714	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So, that -	no
23715	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Per digit.	no
23716	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Per digit.	no
23717	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	You're right. So if you were doing	no
23718	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh, recognition,	no
23719	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Mm-hmm.	no
23720	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So - So the -	no
23721	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	The point there, and this is uh car noise uh, uh things, but - but real -	no
23722	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	"real situation, well, ""real"","	no
23723	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Um, the - uh there's one microphone that's close, that they have as - as	no
23724	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Uh but in a	no
23725	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Uh but it wasn't artificially added to get some - some artificial signal-to-noise ratio. It was just people driving around in a car.	no
23726	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So, that's - that's an indication, uh that was with,	no
23727	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	many sites competing, and this was the very	no
23728	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Although the models weren't,	no
23729	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	More typical numbers like	no
23730	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	that good, right? I mean,	no
23731	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	the models are pretty crappy?	no
23732	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	You're right. I think that we could have done better on the models, but the thing is that we got - this - this is the kind of typical number,	no
23733	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	for all of the, uh, uh,	no
23734	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	things in this task, all of the, um,	no
23735	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	languages.	no
23736	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And so I - I think we'd probably - the models would be better in some than in others. Um,	no
23737	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Hmm.	no
23738	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	so, uh.	no
23739	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Hmm.	no
23740	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	It's gonna be fun to see how we,	no
23741	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	compare at this.	no
23742	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
23743	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Very exciting.	no
23744	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Well the	no
23745	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	strange.	no
23746	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I mean the prosodics are not the same as T_I-digits, for example.	no
23747	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
23748	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So I'm - I'm not sure how much of effect that will have.	no
23749	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	H- how do -	no
23750	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	What do you mean, the prosodics?	no
23751	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Um, just what we were talking about with grouping.	no
23752	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	That with these, the grouping,	no
23753	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	there's no grouping at all, and so it's just -	no
23754	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	the only sort of	no
23755	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	discontinuity you have is at the beginning and the end.	no
23756	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So what are they doing in Aurora, are they reading actual phone numbers, or,	no
23757	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Aurora I don't know.	no
23758	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I don't know what they do in Aurora.	no
23759	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	a - a digit at a time, or - ?	no
23760	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Uh, I'm not sure how - no, no I mean it's connected - it's connected, uh,	no
23761	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Cuz it's -	no
23762	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Connected.	no
23763	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	digits, yeah.	no
23764	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So there's also the -	no
23765	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	But.	no
23766	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	But -	no
23767	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	not just the prosody but the cross -	no
23768	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	the cross-word modeling is probably quite different.	no
23769	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
23770	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	But in T_I-digits,	no
23771	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	H-	no
23772	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	they're reading things	no
23773	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
23774	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	How do we do on T_I-digits?	no
23775	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I don't remember. I mean, very good, right?	no
23776	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah, I mean we were in the.	no
23777	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	One and a half percent, two percent, something like that?	no
23778	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Uh, I th- no I think we got under a percent, but it was - but it's - but I mean.	no
23779	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Oh really? O_K.	no
23780	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	s-	no
23781	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	The	no
23782	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Alright.	no
23783	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Uh, but.	no
23784	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Hmm.	no
23785	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	But, uh, sort of pulling out all the stops. But I think a	no
23786	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
23787	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	But that - I mean it's really - it's - it's close-talking mikes, no noise, clean signal,	no
23788	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	just digits, I mean,	no
23789	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
23790	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	every- everything is good.	no
23791	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	It's the beginning of time in speech recognition.	no
23792	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yes, exactly.	no
23793	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
23794	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And we've only recently got it to anywhere near human.	no
23795	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	It's like the,	no
23796	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	single cell,	no
23797	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Pre-	no
23798	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	you know,	no
23799	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	prehistory.	no
23800	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	it's the beginning of life, yeah.	no
23801	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And it's still like an order of magnitude worse than what humans do.	no
23802	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
23803	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
23804	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So.	no
23805	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	When - When they're wide awake, yeah.	no
23806	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
23807	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Um,	no
23808	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	After coffee.	no
23809	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Not after lunch.	no
23810	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K, so, um,	no
23811	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	what I'll do then is I'll go ahead and enter,	no
23812	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	this data.	no
23813	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And then, hand off to Jane,	no
23814	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	and the transcribers to do the actual extraction of the digits.	no
23815	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
23816	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
23817	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	One question I have that -	no
23818	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	that- I mean, we wouldn't know the answer to now but might,	no
23819	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Hmm.	no
23820	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	do some guessing, but I was talking before about doing some model- modeling of arti- uh,	no
23821	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh,	no
23822	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	features,	no
23823	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	with overlap and so on.	no
23824	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And,	no
23825	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	and,	no
23826	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	um,	no
23827	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	On some subset.	no
23828	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	One thought might be to do this uh, on - on the digits, or some piece of the digits. Uh, it'd be easier,	no
23829	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh, and so forth. The only thing is I'm a little concerned that maybe the	no
23830	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	in w- i- i-	no
23831	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	The reason for doing it is because the - the argument is that certainly with conversational speech, the stuff that we've looked at here before,	no
23832	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	um, just doing the simple mapping,	no
23833	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	from, um,	no
23834	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	the phone,	no
23835	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	to the corresponding features that you could look up in a book,	no
23836	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh, isn't right.	no
23837	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	It isn't actually right. In fact there's these overlapping	no
23838	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	"some nasality is - comes in here, and so forth. And you do this gross thing saying ""Well I guess it's this phone starting there""."	no
23839	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So,	no
23840	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh, that's the reasoning.	no
23841	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	It could be that when we're reading digits, because it's - it's for such a limited set,	no
23842	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	that maybe -	no
23843	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	maybe that phenomenon doesn't occur as much. I don't know.	no
23844	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Di- an- anybody - ?	no
23845	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	It s- strikes me that there are more - each of them is more informative because it's so,	no
23846	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	random, and that people might articulate more, and you that might end up with more - a closer correspondence.	no
23847	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Mm-hmm.	no
23848	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah - that's - I - I agree. That - it's just -	no
23849	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
23850	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Sort of less predictability, and -	no
23851	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Mm-hmm.	no
23852	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
23853	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Well it's definitely true that, when people are,	no
23854	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	It's a -	no
23855	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	reading,	no
23856	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	even if they're re-reading what,	no
23857	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	they had said spontaneously, that they have very different patterns. Mitch showed that, and some,	no
23858	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
23859	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	dissertations have shown that.	no
23860	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So the fact that they're reading, first of all, whether they're reading in a room of,	no
23861	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	people, or rea- you know, just the fact that they're reading will make a difference.	no
23862	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
23863	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And,	no
23864	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Well -	no
23865	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	depends what you're interested in.	no
23866	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Would,	no
23867	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	this corpus really be the right one to even try that on?	no
23868	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	See, I don't know. So, may- maybe the thing will be do - to take some very small subset,	no
23869	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I- mean not have a big,	no
23870	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	program, but take a small set,	no
23871	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh, subset of the conversational speech and a small subset of the digits,	no
23872	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	and	no
23873	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	and - and just get a feeling for it.	no
23874	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Um, just take a look.	no
23875	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Really.	no
23876	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	H-	no
23877	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Cuz I don't think anybody is, I- at least, I don't know,	no
23878	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	of anybody, uh,	no
23879	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	well, I don't know,	no
23880	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	That could - could be an interesting design, too, cuz then you'd have the com- the comparison of the,	no
23881	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	You hafta -	no
23882	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	the	no
23883	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Hey.	no
23884	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh, predictable speech versus the less predictable speech and maybe you'd find that it worked in,	no
23885	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
23886	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	in the,	no
23887	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	case of the pr- of the, uh, non-predictable.	no
23888	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
23889	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Hafta think about,	no
23890	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	the particular acoustic features to mark, too, because,	no
23891	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Mm-hmm.	no
23892	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I mean,	no
23893	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	they wouldn't be able to mark, like,	no
23894	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh,	no
23895	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	you know, uh, tense lax.	no
23896	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Some things are really difficult.	no
23897	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	You know,	no
23898	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	just listening.	no
23899	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	M- I think we can get Ohala in to,	no
23900	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Well.	no
23901	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	give us some advice on that.	no
23902	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
23903	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Also I thought you were thinking of a much more restricted set of features, that -	no
23904	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah, but I - I - I - I was,	no
23905	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	like he said,	no
23906	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah, sure.	no
23907	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Sure.	no
23908	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
23909	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
23910	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	But I mean you want - you want it be restrictive but you also want it to - to - to have coverage.	no
23911	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
23912	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	You know i- you should.	no
23913	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah	no
23914	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	It should be such that if you,	no
23915	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	if you, uh,	no
23916	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	if you had o- um,	no
23917	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	all of the features,	no
23918	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	determined that you - that you were uh ch- have chosen,	no
23919	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	that that would tell you,	no
23920	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh,	no
23921	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	in the steady-state case, uh, the phone.	no
23922	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So,	no
23923	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K.	no
23924	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	um.	no
23925	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Even,	no
23926	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I guess with vowels that would be pretty hard,	no
23927	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	wouldn't it?	no
23928	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	To identify actually, you know, which one it is?	no
23929	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	It would seem to me that the points of articulation would be m- more,	no
23930	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	g- uh, I mean that's - I think about articulatory features, I think about,	no
23931	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	points of articulation, which means,	no
23932	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh, rather than vowels.	no
23933	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
23934	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So, is it, uh, bilabial or dental or is it, you know,	no
23935	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	palatal.	no
23936	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Mm-hmm.	no
23937	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Which - which are all like where - where your tongue comes to rest.	no
23938	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Uvular.	no
23939	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Place of ar- place of articulation.	no
23940	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Place.	no
23941	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Place. Thank you, what - whatev- whatever I s- said, that's - I really meant place.	no
23942	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
23943	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K.	no
23944	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
23945	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K, I see.	no
23946	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
23947	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K we got our jargon then, O_K.	no
23948	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
23949	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Uh.	no
23950	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Well it's also, there's,	no
23951	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	really a difference between,	no
23952	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	the pronunciation models in the dictionary, and,	no
23953	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	the pronunciations that people produce.	no
23954	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And, so,	no
23955	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	You get,	no
23956	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	some of that information from Steve's work on the -	no
23957	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
23958	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	on the labeling and it really,	no
23959	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
23960	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I actually think that data should be used more. That maybe,	no
23961	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	although I think the meeting context is great, that he has transcriptions that give you the actual phone sequence.	no
23962	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And you can go from -	no
23963	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	not from that to the articulatory features, but that would be a better starting point for marking,	no
23964	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	the gestural features, then,	no
23965	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	data where you don't have that, because,	no
23966	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	we - you wanna know,	no
23967	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	both about the way that they're producing a certain sound,	no
23968	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	and what kinds of,	no
23969	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	phonemic,	no
23970	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	differences you get between these,	no
23971	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	transcribed,	no
23972	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	sequences and the dictionary ones.	no
23973	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Well you might be right that mi- might be the way at	no
23974	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	what I was talking about,	no
23975	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	but the particular reason why I was interested in doing that was because I	no
23976	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	when that happened, and,	no
23977	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	John Ohala	no
23978	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Uh, he didn't know what to say,	no
23979	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	about,	no
23980	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	what is the sequence of phones there.	no
23981	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	They came up with some compromise.	no
23982	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Because that really wasn't what it look like. It didn't look like a sequence of phones it look like this blending thing happening here and here and here.	no
23983	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
23984	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
23985	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
23986	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah, so you have this feature here, and,	no
23987	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	There was no	no
23988	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
23989	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	But -	no
23990	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	overlap, yeah.	no
23991	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right. But it still is - there's a -	no
23992	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
23993	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	there are two steps. One -	no
23994	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	you know, one is going from a dictionary pronunciation of something,	no
23995	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And -	no
23996	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
23997	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	like,	no
23998	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	"""gonna see you tomorrow"", it could be ""going to"" or ""gonna"" or """	no
23999	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
24000	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
24001	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	"Or """	no
24002	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And,	no
24003	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	yeah.	no
24004	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	"""Gonna see you tomorrow"", uh,"	no
24005	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	""""	no
24006	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And,	no
24007	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	that it would be nice to have these,	no
24008	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	intermediate, or these - some - these reduced pronunciations that those transcribers had marked or to have people mark those as well.	no
24009	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Mm-hmm.	no
24010	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Because, it's not,	no
24011	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	um,	no
24012	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	that easy to go from the,	no
24013	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	dictionary,	no
24014	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	word pronuncia- the dictionary phone pronunciation,	no
24015	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	to the gestural one without this intermediate or a syllable level kind of,	no
24016	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	representation.	no
24017	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Well I don't think Morgan's suggesting that we	no
24018	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Do you mean,	no
24019	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
24020	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah, I mean, I- I- I'm jus- at the moment of course we're just talking about what,	no
24021	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	to provide as a tool for people to do research who have different ideas about how to do it.	no
24022	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So for instance,	no
24023	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	you might have someone who just has a wor- has words with states,	no
24024	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	and has uh - uh,	no
24025	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	comes from articulatory gestures to that.	no
24026	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And someone else,	no
24027	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	might actually want some phonetic uh intermediate thing.	no
24028	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So I think it would be - be best to have all of it if we could.	no
24029	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	But	no
24030	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	But -	no
24031	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	What I'm imagining is a score-like notation,	no
24032	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
24033	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	where each line is a particular	no
24034	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right, so you would say, you know, it's voiced through here, and so you have label here, and you have nas- nasal here, and,	no
24035	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
24036	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	they - they could be overlapping in all sorts of bizarre ways that don't correspond to the timing on phones.	no
24037	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I mean this is the kind of reason why - I remember when at one of the Switchboard,	no
24038	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	workshops, that uh when we	no
24039	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	"Dave Talkin said, ""can't be done""."	no
24040	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
24041	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	He was - he was, what - what he meant was that this isn't,	no
24042	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	you know, a sequence of phones, and when you actually look at Switchboard that's,	no
24043	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	not what you see, and, you know.	no
24044	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And in - in fact the inter-annotator	no
24045	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And.	no
24046	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	On the harder ones?	no
24047	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	It, yeah I mean it was-	no
24048	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	It depends how you look at it, and I - I understand what you're saying about this,	no
24049	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
24050	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	kind of transcription exactly, because I've seen - you know, where does the voicing bar start and so forth.	no
24051	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
24052	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	All I'm saying is that,	no
24053	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	it is useful to have that -	no
24054	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	the transcription of what was	no
24055	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Uh, if you're gonna add the features it's also useful to have some level of representation which is,	no
24056	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	is a reduced -	no
24057	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	it's a pronunciation variant,	no
24058	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	that currently the dictionaries don't give you because if you add them to the dictionary and you run recognition, you,	no
24059	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Mm-hmm.	no
24060	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
24061	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	you add confusion.	no
24062	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So people purposely don't add them.	no
24063	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
24064	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So it's useful to know which variant was -	no
24065	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	was produced, at least at the phone level.	no
24066	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So it would be - it would be great if we had,	no
24067	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	either these kind of,	no
24068	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	labelings on,	no
24069	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	the same portion of Switchboard that Steve marked, or,	no
24070	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Steve's type markings on this data,	no
24071	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
24072	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	That's all,	no
24073	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Exactly.	no
24074	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	with these.	no
24075	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
24076	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Exactly.	no
24077	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah, no I - I don't disagree with that.	no
24078	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And Steve's type is fairly - it's not that slow,	no
24079	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh,	no
24080	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh, I dunno exactly what the,	no
24081	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	timing was, but.	no
24082	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah u- I don't disagree with it the on- the only thing is that,	no
24083	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	What you actually will end - en- end up with is something,	no
24084	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	i- it's all compromised, right, so,	no
24085	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	the string that you end up with isn't,	no
24086	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	actually,	no
24087	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	what happened.	no
24088	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	But it's - it's the best	no
24089	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Mm-hmm.	no
24090	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And it's more accurate than,	no
24091	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	But.	no
24092	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And it's more accurate than the - than the dictionary or,	no
24093	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	The word.	no
24094	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
24095	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	if you've got a pronunciation uh lexicon that has three or four, this might be have been the fifth one that you	no
24096	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So it's like a continuum. It's - you're going all the way down, yeah.	no
24097	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
24098	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
24099	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
24100	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	That's what I meant is - an- and in some places it would fill in,	no
24101	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
24102	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
24103	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Well -	no
24104	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So - the kinds of gestural features are not everywhere.	no
24105	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So there are some things that you don't have access to either from your ear	no
24106	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
24107	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Mm-hmm.	no
24108	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	but you know what phone it was and that's about all you can -	no
24109	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	all you can say. And then there are	no
24110	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
24111	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	It's basically just having,	no
24112	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	nasality, voicing -	no
24113	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	multiple levels of -	no
24114	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	of,	no
24115	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	information and marking,	no
24116	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
24117	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
24118	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	on the signal.	no
24119	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Well the other difference is that the - the	no
24120	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	are not synchronous, right. They overlap each other in weird ways.	no
24121	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Mm-hmm.	no
24122	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Mm-hmm.	no
24123	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So it's not a strictly one-dimensional signal.	no
24124	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
24125	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So I think that's sorta qualitatively different.	no
24126	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right. You can add the features in,	no
24127	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh, but it'll be underspecified. Th-	no
24128	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Hmm.	no
24129	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Well not with our current system but you could imagine designing a system,	no
24130	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And i- if you're -	no
24131	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	that the states were features, rather than phones.	yes
24132	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Well,	no
24133	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	That's -	no
24134	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	we - we've probably have a	no
24135	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	um,	no
24136	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
24137	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	discussion of, uh - of whether you can do that.	no
24138	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Well,	no
24139	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	well but that - wasn't that kinda the direction? I thought	no
24140	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah, so I mean, what,	no
24141	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	what - where this is, I mean,	no
24142	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I- I want- would like to have something that's useful to people other than those who are doing the specific kind of research I have in mind,	no
24143	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	so it should be something broader. But,	no
24144	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	The -	no
24145	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	we're coming off of stuff that	no
24146	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh,	no
24147	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh, have, um,	no
24148	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	a m- a multi-band system that is, uh, trained through a combination of gradient learning an- and E_M,	no
24149	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	to	no
24150	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	estimate, uh,	no
24151	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	the,	no
24152	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh, value for m- for - for a particular feature.	no
24153	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K.	no
24154	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And this is part of a larger,	no
24155	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	image that	no
24156	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	individual frequency channels are coming up with their own estimate,	no
24157	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	of - of these,	no
24158	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	these kinds of - something like this. Might not be, you know, exact features that,	no
24159	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Jakobson thought of or something. But I mean you know some,	no
24160	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	something like that.	no
24161	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Some kind of low-level features, which are	no
24162	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	fully, you know, phone classification.	no
24163	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And the - the - th- this particular image,	no
24164	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	of how	no
24165	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	is that,	no
24166	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	then given all of these estimates at that level,	no
24167	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	there's a level above it,	no
24168	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	then which is - is making,	no
24169	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	some kind of sound unit classification such as, you know, phone and - and, you know.	no
24170	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	You could argue what,	no
24171	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	what a sound unit should be, and - and so forth. But that - that's sort of what I was imagining doing,	no
24172	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	um, and -	no
24173	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	but it's still open within that whether you would have an intermediate level in which it was actually phones, or	no
24174	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	You wouldn't necessarily have to.	no
24175	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Um, but,	no
24176	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Again, I wouldn't wanna,	no
24177	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	wouldn't want what we - we produced to be so, know, local in perspective that it - it was matched,	no
24178	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	what we were thinking of doing one week,	no
24179	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And - and,	no
24180	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	and, you know, what you're saying is absolutely right. That,	no
24181	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	that if we,	no
24182	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	can we should put in,	no
24183	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh, another level of,	no
24184	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	of description there if we're gonna get into some of this low-level stuff.	no
24185	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Well, you know, um - I mean if we're talking about,	no
24186	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	having the,	no
24187	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	annotators annotate these kinds of features, it seems like,	no
24188	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	You know, you -	no
24189	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	The - the question is,	no
24190	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	do they do that on,	no
24191	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	meeting data?	no
24192	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Or do they do that on,	no
24193	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Switchboard?	no
24194	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	That's what I was saying, maybe meeting data	no
24195	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Well it seems like you could do both. I mean, I was thinking that it would be interesting,	no
24196	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Mm-hmm.	no
24197	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	to do it with respect to,	no
24198	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	parts of Switchboard anyway, in terms of, uh - partly to see,	no
24199	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Mm-hmm.	no
24200	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	if you could,	no
24201	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	generate first	no
24202	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	But also in terms of comparability of, um,	no
24203	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Mm-hmm.	no
24204	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Well cuz the- yeah, and then also, if you did it on Switchboard, you would have,	no
24205	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	what you gain	no
24206	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	the full continuum of transcriptions. You'd have it,	no
24207	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yep.	no
24208	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	from the lowest level, the ac- acoustic features, then you'd have the,	no
24209	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	you know, the phonetic level that Steve did, and,	no
24210	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Mm-hmm.	no
24211	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah that - that's all I was thinking about. it	no
24212	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	yeah.	no
24213	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And you could tell that -	no
24214	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	It'd be a	no
24215	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And you get the relative gain	no
24216	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	the bandwidth might be -	no
24217	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	set then.	no
24218	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	It's so it's a little different.	no
24219	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
24220	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So I mean i- we'll see wha- how much we can,	no
24221	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Mm-hmm.	no
24222	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh,	no
24223	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	get the people to do, and how much money we'll have and all this sort of thing, but,	no
24224	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Mm-hmm.	no
24225	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	But it - it might be good to do what Jane was saying uh, you know,	no
24226	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Might be do both.	no
24227	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	guesses about what we think the features are, based on,	no
24228	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	you know, the phone or Steve's transcriptions or something.	no
24229	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	to make it quicker.	no
24230	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Alright, so based on the phone transcripts they would all be synchronous, but then you could imagine,	no
24231	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Adjusting? Yeah, exactly.	no
24232	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	nudging them here and there.	no
24233	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Scoot the voicing over a little, because -	no
24234	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
24235	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
24236	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Well I think what - I mean I'm - I'm a l- little behind in what they're doing,	no
24237	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	now, and, uh, the stuff they're doing on Switchboard now. But I think that,	no
24238	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Steve and the gang are doing,	no
24239	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	As I re- as I recall.	no
24240	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So I mean that's probably the right way to go anyway, is to - is to start off with an automatic system with a pretty rich pronunciation dictionary that,	no
24241	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	that,	no
24242	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	um,	no
24243	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	you know,	no
24244	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	tries,	no
24245	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	to label it all.	no
24246	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And then,	no
24247	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	people go through and fix it.	no
24248	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So in - in our case you'd think about us s- starting with maybe the regular dictionary entry, and then?	no
24249	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Well,	no
24250	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Or	no
24251	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	regular dictionary, I mean, this is a pretty rich dictionary. It's got,	no
24252	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	got a fair number of pronunciations in it	no
24253	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Or you could start from the - if we were gonna,	no
24254	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	But -	no
24255	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	do the same set,	no
24256	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	of sentences that Steve had,	no
24257	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	done, we could start with those transcriptions.	no
24258	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Mm-hmm.	no
24259	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
24260	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	That's actually what I was thinking, is	no
24261	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So I was thinking -	no
24262	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
24263	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
24264	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh, if you run a regular dictionary,	no
24265	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	um,	no
24266	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	even if you have variants,	no
24267	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	in there,	no
24268	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
24269	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	which most people don't, you don't always get,	no
24270	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	out,	no
24271	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	the actual pronunciations, so that's why the human transcriber's giving you the -	no
24272	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
24273	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	that pronunciation, and so y-	no
24274	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Actually maybe they're using phone recognizers.	no
24275	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Oh.	no
24276	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	they - they - I thought that they were - we	no
24277	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	They are.	no
24278	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Is that what they're doing?	no
24279	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Oh, O_K.	no
24280	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
24281	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah, so I think that i- i- we also don't have, I mean,	no
24282	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	we've got a good start on it, but we don't have a really good,	no
24283	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	meeting,	no
24284	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	recorder or recognizer or transcriber or anything yet, so.	no
24285	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
24286	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So, I mean another way to look at this is to,	no
24287	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	is to, uh,	no
24288	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	do some stuff on Switchboard which has all this other,	no
24289	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	stuff to it.	no
24290	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And then, um,	no
24291	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	As we get,	no
24292	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	further down the road and we can do more things ahead of time, we can,	no
24293	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Mm-hmm.	no
24294	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K.	no
24295	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	do some of the same things to the meeting data.	no
24296	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
24297	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And I'm - and these people might - they - they are, s-	no
24298	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah	no
24299	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	most of them	no
24300	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Are they busy for the next couple years, or - ?	no
24301	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Well, you know, I mean they,	no
24302	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	they - they're interested in continuing working with us, so - I mean - I,	no
24303	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	and this would be up their alley, so, we could - when the - when you d-	no
24304	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	meet with,	no
24305	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	with John Ohala and find,	no
24306	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	taxonomy you want to apply, then,	no
24307	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	they'd be,	no
24308	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
24309	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	good to train onto it.	no
24310	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
24311	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Anyway, this is,	no
24312	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
24313	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	not an urgent thing at all, just it came up.	no
24314	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	It'd be very interesting though, to have	no
24315	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
24316	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I wonder, how would you do a forced alignment?	no
24317	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I think so, too.	no
24318	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Might -	no
24319	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	To - to - I mean, you'd wanna iterate, somehow.	no
24320	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah. It's interesting thing to think about.	no
24321	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	It might be -	no
24322	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Hmm.	no
24323	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I was thinking it might be n-	no
24324	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I mean you'd - you'd want models for spreading.	no
24325	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Of the f- acoustic features?	no
24326	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
24327	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Mm-hmm.	no
24328	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Mm-hmm.	no
24329	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
24330	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Well it might be neat to do some,	no
24331	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	phonetic,	no
24332	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	features on these,	no
24333	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	and the uh -	no
24334	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	These k- No, I'm	no
24335	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh, elements. I don't know what you call	no
24336	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	But not just fill pauses but all kinds of ways of	no
24337	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Uh-huh.	no
24338	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And some of them are,	no
24339	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	"""hmm!"""	no
24340	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	"""hmm"""	no
24341	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	"""O_K"", ""uh"""	no
24342	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Grunts, uh,	no
24343	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	He's got lip -	no
24344	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	In the meetings.	no
24345	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	We should move on.	no
24346	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	yes
24347	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Uh,	no
24348	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	new version of, uh, presegmentation?	no
24349	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Uh, oh yeah, um,	no
24350	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I worked a little bit on the - on the presegmentation to - to get another version which does channel-specific, uh, speech-nonspeech detection.	no
24351	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And, what I did is I used some normalized features which, uh, look in- into the - which is normalized energy, uh,	no
24352	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	energy normalized by the mean over the channels and by the,	no
24353	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	minimum over the,	no
24354	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	within each channel.	no
24355	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And to - to, mm,	no
24356	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	to, yeah, to normalize also loudness and - and modified loudness and things and that those special features	no
24357	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Oh.	no
24358	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And, and,	no
24359	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	therefore to be able to, uh, somewhat distinguish between foreground and background speech in - in the different - in - each channel.	no
24360	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And,	no
24361	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	eh, I tested it on - on three or four meetings and it seems to work, well yeah, fairly well, I - I would say.	no
24362	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	There are some problems with the lapel mike.	no
24363	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Of course.	no
24364	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Uh, yeah.	no
24365	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Wow that's great.	no
24366	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And.	no
24367	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So I - I understand that's what you were saying about your problem with,	no
24368	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
24369	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	minimum.	no
24370	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And.	no
24371	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah, and - and I had - I had, uh, specific problems with.	no
24372	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I get it.	no
24373	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So new- use ninetieth quartile, rather than,	no
24374	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
24375	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
24376	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	minimum.	no
24377	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Wow.	no
24378	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah - yeah, then - I - I did some - some - some things like that,	no
24379	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Interesting.	no
24380	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	as there - there are some - some problems in,	no
24381	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	when,	no
24382	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	in the channel, there -	no
24383	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Then,	no
24384	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	the,	no
24385	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	yeah, there are - there are some problems with - with - with n- with normalization, and,	no
24386	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	then, uh, there the system doesn't work at all.	no
24387	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So, I'm - I'm glad that there is the - the digit part, where everybody is forced to say something,	no
24388	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
24389	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	so,	no
24390	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	that's - that's great for - for my purpose.	no
24391	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And,	no
24392	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	the thing is I - I,	no
24393	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	then the evaluation of - of the system is a little bit hard, as I don't have any references.	no
24394	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Well we did the hand - the one by hand.	no
24395	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah, that's the one - one wh- where I do the training on so I can't do the evaluation on	no
24396	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So the thing is, can the transcribers perhaps do some,	no
24397	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Uh.	no
24398	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	some - some meetings in - in terms of speech-nonspeech in - in the specific channels?	no
24399	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Well won't you have that from their transcriptions?	no
24400	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Well, I have -	no
24401	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Well, O_K, so, now we need - so, um,	no
24402	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	No, cuz we need is really tight.	no
24403	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
24404	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I think I might have done what you're requesting, though I did it in the service of a different thing.	no
24405	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Oh, great.	no
24406	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I have thirty minutes that I've more tightly transcribed with reference to individual channels.	no
24407	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K.	no
24408	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K, that's great.	no
24409	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	That's great for me. Yeah, so.	no
24410	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And I could - And -	no
24411	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Hopefully that's not the same meeting that we did.	no
24412	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And -	no
24413	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	No, actually it's a different meeting.	no
24414	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Good.	no
24415	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So, um, e- so the, you know, we have the,	no
24416	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K.	no
24417	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	th- they transcribe as if it's one channel with these - with the slashes to separate the overlapping parts. And	no
24418	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
24419	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
24420	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	all these things split across according to channel, and then that means that,	no
24421	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	if a person contributed more than once in a given,	no
24422	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	overlap during that time bend that -	no
24423	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	that two parts of the utterance end up together, it's the same channel,	no
24424	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	and then I took his tool, and last night for the first thirty minutes of	no
24425	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K.	no
24426	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	one of these transcripts, I,	no
24427	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	tightened up the, um,	no
24428	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	boundaries on individual speakers' channels, cuz his - his interface	no
24429	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K.	no
24430	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
24431	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
24432	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And	no
24433	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So, current -	no
24434	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	so, yeah - yeah, that - that - that's great, but what	no
24435	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	so.	no
24436	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yes.	no
24437	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Might not be what you need.	no
24438	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	there is a system,	no
24439	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah, so if we could get a couple meetings done with that level of precision I think that would be a good idea.	no
24440	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K.	no
24441	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Oh, O_K.	no
24442	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
24443	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Uh, how - how m- much time - so the meetings vary in length, what are we talking about in terms of the number of minutes you'd like to have as your - as your training set?	no
24444	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	It seems to me	no
24445	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	a few minutes from - from different meetings, so.	no
24446	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	But I'm not sure about how much.	no
24447	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K, now you're saying different meetings because of different	no
24448	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Both - both. Different - different number of speakers, different speakers, different	no
24449	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K.	no
24450	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah, we don't have that much variety in meetings yet, uh, I mean we have this	no
24451	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	meeting and the feature meeting and we have a couple others that we have uh,	no
24452	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah, m-	no
24453	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	couple examples of.	no
24454	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
24455	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Mm-hmm.	no
24456	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	But -	no
24457	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	but, uh,	no
24458	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Even probably with the gains	no
24459	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Uh, not really as - uh, because of the normalization, yeah. Yeah.	no
24460	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Poten- potentially.	no
24461	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Oh, cuz	no
24462	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Oh, O_K.	no
24463	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	We can try running - we haven't done this yet because,	no
24464	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	um,	no
24465	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh, Andreas an- is - is gonna move over the S_R_I recognizer. i- basically I ran out of machines at S_R_I,	no
24466	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	cuz we're running the evals	no
24467	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K.	no
24468	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	But, once that's moved over,	no
24469	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh, hopefully in a -	no
24470	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	a couple days,	no
24471	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	then, we can take,	no
24472	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	um,	no
24473	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	what Jane just told us about as,	no
24474	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Oh, shoot!	no
24475	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	the presegmented,	no
24476	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	the - the segmentations that you did,	no
24477	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
24478	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
24479	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	at level eight or som-	no
24480	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	The pre- presegment-	no
24481	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	threshold that Jane,	no
24482	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
24483	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	tha-	no
24484	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	and try doing,	no
24485	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	forced alignment.	no
24486	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	um,	no
24487	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	With the recognizer? Yeah.	no
24488	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	on the word strings. And	no
24489	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	then we're - we're fine, but,	no
24490	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah. M-	no
24491	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I don't know yet whether these,	no
24492	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	segments that contain a lot of pauses around the words,	no
24493	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I -	no
24494	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	will work or not.	no
24495	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I would quite like to have some manually transcribed references for - for the system, as I'm not sure if - if it's really good to compare with - with some other automatic,	no
24496	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
24497	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
24498	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	found boundaries.	no
24499	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Well, no, if we were to start with this and then tweak it h- manually, would that - that would be O_K?	no
24500	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
24501	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
24502	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah	no
24503	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	They might be O_K. It - you know it really depends on a lot of things, but,	no
24504	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K.	no
24505	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
24506	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I would have maybe a transcriber,	no
24507	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh, look at the result of a forced alignment and then adjust those. That might save some time.	no
24508	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
24509	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	To a- adjust them, or, yeah.	no
24510	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah, yeah.	no
24511	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	If they're horrible it won't help at all, but they might not be horrible.	no
24512	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah, great.	no
24513	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
24514	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So - but I'll let you know when we,	no
24515	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K, great.	no
24516	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh, have that.	no
24517	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	How many minutes would you want from - I mean, we could	no
24518	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	get a section, you know, like say a minute or so, from every meeting that we have so f- from the newer ones that we're working on,	no
24519	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	everyone that we have.	no
24520	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And then,	no
24521	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	should provide this.	no
24522	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	If it's not the	no
24523	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Often there are some - some strange things going on which - which aren't really,	no
24524	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	well, for, which - which aren't re- re- really good.	no
24525	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So.	no
24526	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	What - what I'd quite like, perhaps, is,	no
24527	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	to have,	no
24528	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	some five minutes of - of - of different	no
24529	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Somewhere	no
24530	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
24531	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And, then I wanted to ask you just for my inter- information, then,	no
24532	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	would you,	no
24533	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	be trai-	no
24534	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	cuz I don't quite unders- so, would you be training then,	no
24535	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	um,	no
24536	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	the segmenter so that,	no
24537	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	it could, on the basis of that, segment the rest of the meeting?	no
24538	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So, if I give you like	no
24539	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh, to,	no
24540	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I - I could do a - a retraining with that, yeah.	no
24541	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	providing tighter time	no
24542	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Wow, interesting.	no
24543	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	That's - but - but I hope that I - I don't	no
24544	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K.	no
24545	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So, uh it c- can be do in an unsupervised way.	no
24546	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Uh-huh.	no
24547	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Excellent.	no
24548	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So.	no
24549	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I'm - I'm not sure,	no
24550	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	but, for - for - for those three meetings whi- which I - which I did,	no
24551	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	it seems to be,	no
24552	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	quite well, but,	no
24553	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	there are some - some - as I said some problems with the lapel mike, but,	no
24554	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	perhaps we can do something with - with cross-correlations to,	no
24555	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	to get rid of the - of those.	no
24556	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And.	no
24557	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah. That's - that's what I - that's my	no
24558	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	false overlaps.	no
24559	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Wonderful.	no
24560	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Are the, um, wireless,	no
24561	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	different than the wired,	no
24562	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	mikes, at all? I mean, have you noticed any difference?	no
24563	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I'm - I'm not sure, um,	no
24564	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	if - if there are any wired mikes in those meetings, or, uh, I have - have to loo- have a look at them but, I'm - I'm - I think there's no difference between,	no
24565	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So it's just the lapel versus everything else?	no
24566	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
24567	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
24568	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K, so then, if that's five minutes per meeting we've got like twelve minutes,	no
24569	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	twelve meetings,	no
24570	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	roughly, that I'm - that I've been working with, then -	no
24571	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Of - of - of the meetings that you're working with, how many of them are different,	no
24572	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	No.	no
24573	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	tha- are there any of them that are different than,	no
24574	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	these two meetings?	no
24575	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Well - oh wa- in terms of the speakers or the conditions or the?	no
24576	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah, speakers. Sorry. So.	no
24577	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Um,	no
24578	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah, that -	no
24579	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	we have different combinations of speakers. I mean, just from what I've seen, uh, there are some where,	no
24580	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	um,	no
24581	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	you're present or not present, and,	no
24582	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	then - then you have the difference between the networks group and this group	no
24583	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah, I know, some of the N_S_A meetings, yeah.	no
24584	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah. So I didn't know in the group you had if you had - so you have the networks meeting?	no
24585	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
24586	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yep, we do.	no
24587	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
24588	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Do you have any of Jerry's meetings in your,	no
24589	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	pack, er,	no
24590	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Um, no.	no
24591	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	No?	no
24592	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	We	no
24593	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yep.	no
24594	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	This week.	no
24595	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	We're gonna be recording them every	no
24596	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	u-	no
24597	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
24598	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Cuz I think he really needs variety, and - and having as much variety for speaker certainly would be a big part of that I think.	no
24599	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	so -	no
24600	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Great.	no
24601	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
24602	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
24603	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K, so if I,	no
24604	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K, included - include,	no
24605	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K, then, uh, if I were to include all together samples from twelve meetings that would only take an hour and I could get the transcribers to do that right - I mean, what I mean is,	no
24606	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	that would be an hour	no
24607	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
24608	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And.	no
24609	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right. Ye- But you're - y-	no
24610	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	That's - that's.	no
24611	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I don't mean transcribe I mean - I mean adjust. So they get it into the multi-channel format and then adjust the timebands so it's precise.	no
24612	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So that should be faster than the ten times kind of thing, yeah.	no
24613	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Absolutely. I did - I did, um,	no
24614	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh, so,	no
24615	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	last night I did,	no
24616	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh,	no
24617	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Oh gosh,	no
24618	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	well, last night, I did about half an hour in,	no
24619	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	three hours,	no
24620	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
24621	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	which is not,	no
24622	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	terrific, but, um,	no
24623	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah. Well, that's probably.	no
24624	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	anyway, it's an hour and a half per -	no
24625	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So.	no
24626	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Well,	no
24627	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I can't calculate on my,	no
24628	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Do the transcribers actually start wi- with, uh, transcribing new meetings, or	no
24629	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Well, um they're still working - they still have enough to finish that I haven't assigned a new meeting, but the next,	no
24630	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K.	no
24631	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	m- m- I was about to need to assign a new meeting and I was going to take it from one of the new ones, and I could easily give them Jerry Feldman's meeting, no problem.	no
24632	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K.	no
24633	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And,	no
24634	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K.	no
24635	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	then -	no
24636	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So they're really running out of,	no
24637	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	data, prett- I mean that's good.	no
24638	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Mm-hmm. Uh, that first set.	no
24639	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Um,	no
24640	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K.	no
24641	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	They're running out of data unless we s- make the decision that we should go over and start,	no
24642	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So -	no
24643	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh, transcribing the other set.	no
24644	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	There - the first - the first half.	no
24645	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And so I was in the process of like editing them but this is	no
24646	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
24647	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K.	no
24648	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Alright.	no
24649	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	We funded the experiment with, uh - also we were thinking maybe applying that that to getting the,	no
24650	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah, that'll be,	no
24651	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	very useful to getting the overlaps to be more precise all the way through.	no
24652	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So this, blends nicely into the update on transcripts.	no
24653	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yes, it does.	no
24654	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So, um,	no
24655	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	um,	no
24656	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah, please. Go ahead.	no
24657	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Liz, and - and Don, and I met this morning,	no
24658	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	in the BARCO room,	no
24659	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	with the lecture hall,	no
24660	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And this afternoon.	no
24661	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	and this afternoon, it drifted into the afternoon,	no
24662	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh, concerning this issue of,	no
24663	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	um,	no
24664	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	the,	no
24665	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	well there's basically the issue of the interplay between the transcript format and the processing that,	no
24666	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	they need to do for,	no
24667	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	the S_R_I recognizer.	no
24668	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And, um,	no
24669	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	well, so, I mentioned the process that I'm going through with the data, so, you know, I get the data back from the transcri- Well, s-	no
24670	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh, metaphorically, get the data back from the transcriber, and then I,	no
24671	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	check for simple things like spelling errors and things like that.	no
24672	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And, um,	no
24673	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I'm going to be doing a more thorough editing,	no
24674	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	with respect to consistency of the conventions.	no
24675	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	But they're - they're generally very good.	no
24676	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And,	no
24677	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	then,	no
24678	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I run it through, uh, the channelize program to get it into the multi-channel format,	no
24679	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K.	no
24680	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And	no
24681	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	what we discussed this morning,	no
24682	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I would summarize as saying that,	no
24683	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	um,	no
24684	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	these units that result,	no
24685	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	in a - a particular channel and a particular timeband,	no
24686	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	at - at that level,	no
24687	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	um,	no
24688	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	vary in length.	no
24689	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And,	no
24690	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	um,	no
24691	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	their recognizer would prefer that the units not be overly long.	no
24692	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	But it's really an empirical question,	no
24693	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	whether the units we get at this point through,	no
24694	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	just that process I described might be sufficient for them. So,	no
24695	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	as a first pass through, a first chance without having to do a lot of hand-editing,	no
24696	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	what we're gonna do,	no
24697	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	is, I'll run it through channelize,	no
24698	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	give them those data after I've done the editing process and be sure it's clean.	no
24699	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And I can do that,	no
24700	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	pretty quickly,	no
24701	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Mm-hmm.	no
24702	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	with just,	no
24703	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	that minimal editing,	no
24704	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	without having to hand-break things.	no
24705	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And then we'll see if the units that we're getting,	no
24706	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh,	no
24707	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	with the - at that level,	no
24708	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	are sufficient.	no
24709	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And maybe they don't	no
24710	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And if they do need to be further broken down then maybe it just be piece-wise, maybe it won't be the whole thing.	no
24711	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So, that's - that's what we were discussing,	no
24712	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	this morning as far as I -	no
24713	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
24714	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Among - also we discussed some adaptational things, so it's like,	no
24715	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Then lots of -	no
24716	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
24717	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh -	no
24718	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	You know I hadn't, uh, incorporated,	no
24719	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	a convention explicitly to handle acronyms, for example,	no
24720	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	but if someone says,	no
24721	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	P_Z_M	no
24722	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	it would be nice to have that be directly interpretable from,	no
24723	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	the transcript what they said, or Pi- uh	no
24724	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Mm-hmm.	no
24725	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	y- it's - and so,	no
24726	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	um,	no
24727	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I've - I've incorporated also convention,	no
24728	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	with that but that's easy to handle at the post editing phase, and I'll mention it to,	no
24729	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	transcribers for the next phase but that's O_K. And then,	no
24730	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	a similar conv- uh, convention for	no
24731	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Um,	no
24732	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	and also I'll be, um,	no
24733	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	encoding, as I do my post-editing, the,	no
24734	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	things that are in curly brackets, which are clarificational material.	no
24735	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And eh to incorporate, uh, keyword,	no
24736	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	at the beginning. So,	no
24737	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	it's gonna be either a gloss or it's gonna be a vocal sound like a,	no
24738	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	laugh or a cough,	no
24739	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	or, so forth.	no
24740	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Or a non-vocal sound like a doors- door-slam, and that can be easily done with a,	no
24741	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	you know, just a - one little additional thing in the,	no
24742	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	in the general format.	no
24743	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah we j- we just needed a way to,	no
24744	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	strip, you know, all the comments, all the things th- the - that	no
24745	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	linguist wants but the recognizer can't do anything with.	no
24746	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Um,	no
24747	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	but to keep things that we mapped to like reject models, or, you know,	no
24748	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh, mouth noise, or,	no
24749	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	cough.	no
24750	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And then there's this interesting issue Jane brought up which I hadn't thought about before but I was,	no
24751	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	realizing as I went through the transcripts, that there are some noises like,	no
24752	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	um, well the - good example was an inbreath, where a transcriber working from,	no
24753	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	the mixed,	no
24754	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	signal,	no
24755	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	doesn't know whose breath it is, and they've been assigning it to someone that may or may not be correct.	no
24756	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
24757	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And what we do is, if it's a breath sound, you know, a sound from the speaker, we map it,	no
24758	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	to,	no
24759	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	a noise model, like a mouth-noise model in the recognizer, and,	no
24760	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	yeah, it probably doesn't hurt that much once in a while to have these, but,	no
24761	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	if they're in the wrong channel, that's,	no
24762	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	not a good idea.	no
24763	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And then there's also,	no
24764	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	things like door-slams that's really in no one's channel, they're like -	no
24765	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	it's in the room.	no
24766	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
24767	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
24768	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And	no
24769	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	idea of having,	no
24770	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	like an extra,	no
24771	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	An extra channel.	no
24772	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh couple tiers, yeah.	no
24773	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah. I've been - I've been adding that to the ones I've been editing.	no
24774	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And we were thinking,	no
24775	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	that is useful also when there's uncertainties. So if they hear a breath and they don't know who breath it is it's better to put it in that channel than to put it in the speaker's channel because maybe it was someone else's breath, or -	no
24776	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Uh, so I think that's a good - you can always clean that up, post-processing.	no
24777	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
24778	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So a lot of little details, but I think we're,	no
24779	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	coming to some kinda closure,	no
24780	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	on that. So the idea is then,	no
24781	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh, Don can take,	no
24782	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh, Jane's post-processed channelized version,	no
24783	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	and,	no
24784	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	with some scripts, you know, convert that to -	no
24785	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	to a reference for the recognizer and we can,	no
24786	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	can run these.	no
24787	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So	no
24788	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	ready - you know, as soon as that's ready, and as soon as the recognizer is here we can get,	no
24789	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	twelve hours of force-aligned and recognized data.	no
24790	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And, you know,	no
24791	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	start,	no
24792	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	working on it, so we're,	no
24793	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And -	no
24794	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I dunno a coup- a week or two away I would say from,	no
24795	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh, if - if that process is automatic once we get your post-process,	no
24796	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	transcript.	no
24797	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Mm-hmm.	no
24798	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And that doesn't - the amount of editing that it would require is not very much either. I'm just	no
24799	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	will be sufficient cuz I would save a lot of, uh,	no
24800	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	time,	no
24801	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	dividing things.	no
24802	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah, some of them are quite long.	no
24803	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Just from - I dunno how long were - you did one?	no
24804	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I saw a couple,	no
24805	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	and that was just without looking too hard for it, so,	no
24806	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
24807	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Well n-	no
24808	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I would imagine that there might be some that are longer.	no
24809	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	One question, e- w- would that be a single speaker or is that multiple speakers overlapping?	no
24810	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	No.	no
24811	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	No, but if we're gonna segment it, like if there's one speaker in there,	no
24812	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	"that says ""O_K"" or something,"	no
24813	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	right in the middle, it's gonna have a lot of dead time	no
24814	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right. It's not the -	no
24815	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	it's not the fact that we can't process a twenty second segment, it's the fact that,	no
24816	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	there's twenty seconds in which to place one word in the wrong place-	no
24817	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
24818	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	You know, if -	no
24819	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
24820	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	if someone has a very short utterance there, and that's where,	no
24821	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	we,	no
24822	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	might wanna have this individual, you know,	no
24823	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yep.	no
24824	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	ha- have your pre- pre-process input.	no
24825	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
24826	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Sure.	no
24827	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I - I - I thought that perhaps the transcribers could start then from the - those mult- multi-channel,	no
24828	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And I just don't know, I have to run it.	no
24829	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	That's very important.	no
24830	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh, speech-nonspeech detections, if they would like to.	no
24831	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
24832	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	In - in doing the hand-marking? Yeah that's what I was thinking, too.	no
24833	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
24834	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
24835	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So that's probably what will happen, but we'll try it this way and see.	no
24836	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
24837	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
24838	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I mean it's probably good enough for force-alignment.	no
24839	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	If it's not then we're really -	no
24840	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	then we def- definitely	no
24841	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
24842	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh, but for free recognition I'm - it'll probably not be good enough. We'll probably get lots of errors because of the cross-talk, and,	no
24843	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yep.	no
24844	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	noises and things.	no
24845	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Good	no
24846	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	probably our agenda, or starting up there.	yes
24847	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	probably our agenda, or starting up there.	no
24848	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Oh I wanted to ask one thing,	no
24849	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah?	no
24850	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	the microphones - the new microphones, when do we get, uh?	no
24851	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Uh, they said it would take about a week.	no
24852	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Oh, exciting.	no
24853	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	K_.	no
24854	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	K_.	no
24855	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	You ordered	no
24856	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Mm-hmm.	no
24857	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Great.	no
24858	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So what happens to our old microphones?	no
24859	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	They go where old microphones go.	no
24860	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Um -	no
24861	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Do we give them to someone,	no
24862	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Well the only thing we're gonna have extra,	no
24863	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	We don't have more	no
24864	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	for now,	no
24865	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right, we don- so the only thing we'll have extra now is just the lapel.	no
24866	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
24867	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Not - not the,	no
24868	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	just the lapel.	no
24869	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Just the lapel itself.	no
24870	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Um, and then one of the - one of those.	no
24871	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Since, what I decided to do, on Morgan's suggestion, was just get two,	no
24872	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	new microphones,	no
24873	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	um, and try them out.	no
24874	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Mm-hmm.	no
24875	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And then, if we	no
24876	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K.	no
24877	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
24878	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Since they're - they're like two hundred bucks a piece, we won't, uh,	no
24879	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	at least try	no
24880	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So it's a replacement for this headset mike?	no
24881	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yep.	no
24882	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yep.	no
24883	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
24884	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And they're gonna do the wiring for us.	no
24885	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	What's the, um, style of the headset?	no
24886	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	It's, um,	no
24887	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	it's by Crown, and it's one of these sort of mount around the ear thingies,	no
24888	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	and,	no
24889	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh, when I s- when I	no
24890	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And this is how apparently a lot of people are getting around it.	no
24891	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Hmm.	no
24892	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And I checked on the web, and	no
24893	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	raved about this particular mike.	no
24894	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	It's apparently comfortable and stays on the head well, so we'll see if it's any good.	no
24895	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	But, uh,	no
24896	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I think it's promising.	no
24897	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	You said it was used by aerobics instructors?	no
24898	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yep.	no
24899	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yep, so it was -	no
24900	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Hmm.	no
24901	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	That says a lot.	no
24902	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	it was advertised for performers and -	no
24903	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	For the recor- for the record Adam is not a paid employee or a consultant of Crown.	no
24904	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Excuse me?	no
24905	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Oh.	no
24906	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Excuse me?	no
24907	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
24908	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	"I said ""For the record Adam is - is not a"	no
24909	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	That's right.	no
24910	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	However, he may be solicited after these meetings are distributed.	no
24911	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Well we're using the Crown P_Z_Ms. These are Crown aren't they?	no
24912	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Don't worry about finishing your dissertation.	no
24913	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
24914	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	The P_Z_Ms	no
24915	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah, I thought they were.	no
24916	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	You bet. You bet.	no
24917	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And they work	no
24918	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yes.	no
24919	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So if we go to a workshop about all this - this it's gonna be a meeting about meetings about meetings.	no
24920	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K.	no
24921	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And then it - we have to go to the planning session for that workshop.	no
24922	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Oh, yeah, what - Which'll be the meeting about the meeting about the meeting. Yeah?	no
24923	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Oh, god.	no
24924	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Cuz then it would be a meeting about the meeting about the meeting about meetings.	no
24925	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Ooo.	no
24926	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	"Just start saying ""M_ four"". Yeah, O_K."	no

24928	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	M_ to the fourth.	yes
24929	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Should we do the digits?	no

25086	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Up high - high as you can get.	no
25087	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Channel one one one.	no
25088	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K, so for - for -	no
25089	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	This is - chan-	no
25090	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	For people wearing the wireless mikes, like - like this one, I find the easiest way to wear it is sorta this - this sorta like that. It's actually a lot more comfortable then if you try to put it over your temples, so -	no
25091	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	channel channel	no
25092	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Channel five, channel five.	no
25093	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no

25095	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Mm-hmm.	no
25096	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Test, test test.	no
25097	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	What do you do, you do it higher? Mm-hmm.	no
25098	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Adam's just trying to generate good uh data for the recognizer there.	no
25099	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah, I think we're supposed to - that's right.	no
25100	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	And then also, for - for all of them, if your boom is adjustable, the boom should be towards the corner of your mouth, and about a- uh a thumb to a thumb and a half distance away from your mouth, so about like I'm wearing it now.	no
25101	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Test test.	no
25102	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	By the way, there was a bug. Yeah, i- it wasn't using the proper	no
25103	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Oh.	no
25104	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	It's not always possible.	no
25105	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	so- so Jane, you could actually do even a little closer to your mouth, but -	no
25106	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Hmm?	no
25107	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I could - can this be adjuste- like this? Is that	no
25108	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Why didn't you get the same results and the unadapted?	no
25109	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Oh, because when it estimates the transformer pro- produces like a single matrix or something.	no
25110	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yep.	no
25111	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Adam, I'm not - uh, looks kinda low on channel five - no? Maybe not. Hello? It's O_K? Is this O_K?	no
25112	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O- Oh oh I see. I see, I see.	no
25113	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K.	no
25114	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Channel five, s- speak again. Yeah, that's alright. I mean, we could - we could up the gain slightly if you wanted to.	no
25115	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Hello.	no
25116	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Basically there were no counts	no
25117	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
25118	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I see what you mean.	no
25119	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Who's channel B_?	no
25120	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	but -	no
25121	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Uh, channel B_ is probably Liz.	no
25122	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Uh channel B_ - I am channel B_. No, channel B_. Yeah, yeah.	no
25123	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Uh oh.	no
25124	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Channel eight, eight.	no
25125	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	You wanna close this, or	no
25126	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	No I- yeah, yeah, you're channel B_. So can you talk a bit? I thought it might be too	no
25127	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Thank you.	no
25128	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Hello, hello.	no
25129	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K, yeah, channel B_, one two three four five.	no
25130	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah, it's alright. So, the gain isn't real good.	no
25131	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	We're recording, right? Yeah.	no
25132	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K, so we are recording.	no
25133	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K.	no
25134	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Ah.	no
25135	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Oh.	no
25136	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K.	no
25137	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Um everyone should have at least two forms possibly three in front of you depending on who you are.	no
25138	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Um we - we're doing a new speaker form and you only have to spea- fill out the speaker form once but everyone does need to do it.	no
25139	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	And so that's the name, sex, email, et cetera.	no
25140	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Mm-hmm.	no
25141	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	We - we had a lot of discussion about the variety of English and so on so	no
25142	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	if you don't know what to put just leave it blank.	no
25143	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Um	no
25144	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I - I designed the form and I don't know what to put for my own region,	no
25145	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Mmm.	no
25146	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	California.	no
25147	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I think -	no
25148	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	California.	no
25149	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	California.	no
25150	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Um may I make one suggestion? Instead of age put date of - uh year of birth because age will change, but	no
25151	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Sure.	no
25152	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Oh.	no
25153	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	The year of birth changes, you know, stays the same, usually.	no
25154	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Although on -	no
25155	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	A- actually, wait a minute, shouldn't it be the other way around?	no
25156	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Birth year?	no
25157	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	course on the other - on the other hand you could -	no
25158	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	On the other side, yeah.	no
25159	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	you view it as the age at the time of the -	no
25160	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well the thing is, if ten years from now you look at this form knowing that -	no
25161	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yes, but what we care about is the age at - at the recording date rather than the -	no
25162	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	But there's no other date on the form.	no
25163	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O- yeah.	no
25164	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	W- we don't care how they - old they really are.	no
25165	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well - well I don't know.	no
25166	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yes.	no
25167	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well I guess it depends on how long the corpus is gonna be collected for.	no
25168	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Anyway.	no
25169	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah, that's true.	no
25170	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I still don't see the problem.	no
25171	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Either way	no
25172	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	yeah I think - I think age is alright and then	no
25173	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K.	no
25174	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	If you have the date	no
25175	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	um there will be attached to this a point or two these forms	no
25176	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Mm-hmm.	no
25177	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	uh so that you'll be able to extract the date off that	no
25178	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	so, anyway.	no
25179	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	And so then you also have a digits form	no
25180	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	which needs to be filled out every time, the speaker form only once, the digit form every time even if you don't read the digits you have to fill out the digits form so that we know that you were at the meeting.	no
25181	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K? And then also if you haven't filled one out already you do have to fill out a consent form.	no
25182	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	And that should just be one person whose name I don't know.	no
25183	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K?	no
25184	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Do you want this	no
25185	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Uh sure.	no
25186	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Thank you.	yes
25187	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So uh	no
25188	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K so	no
25189	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	should we do agenda items?	no
25190	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Uh oh that's a good idea.	no
25191	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I shouldn't run the meeting.	no
25192	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Uh well I have - I wanna talk about new microphones and wireless stuff.	no
25193	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Mmm.	no
25194	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	And I'm sure	no
25195	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Liz and Andreas wanna talk about recognition results.	no
25196	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Anything else?	no
25197	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I guess - what time do we have to leave?	no
25198	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Three thirty?	no
25199	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
25200	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Why don't you go first then.	yes
25201	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Three thirty?	no
25202	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
25203	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Why don't you go first then.	no
25204	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah, so.	no
25205	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah, good idea.	no
25206	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K.	no
25207	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Um	no
25208	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well, I - I sent out an email	no
25209	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	s- couple hours ago so	no
25210	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	um	no
25211	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	with Andreas' help um Andreas put together a sort of no frills recognizer which is uh	no
25212	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	gender-dependent but like no adaptation, no cross-word models, no trigrams - a bigram recognizer	no
25213	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	and that's trained on Switchboard which is telephone conversations.	no
25214	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Um	no
25215	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	and thanks to Don's help wh- who - Don took	no
25216	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	the first meeting that Jane had transcribed	no
25217	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	and um	no
25218	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	and uh Don sampled that so -	no
25219	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	so eight K_	no
25220	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	um and then we ran up to I guess the first twenty minutes, up to synch time of one two zero zero	no
25221	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Um yeah because I guess there's some, and Don can talk to Jane about this, there's some bug in the actual synch time file that	no
25222	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Or so.	no
25223	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	ah uh I'm - we're not sure where it came from but stuff after that was a little messier.	no
25224	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Anyway so it's twenty minutes and I actually um	no
25225	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Hmm.	no
25226	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I -	no
25227	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	was that - did that - did that recording have the glitch in the middle?	no
25228	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I'm puzzled by that.	no
25229	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I - oh - oh, I see. Oh there was a glitch somewhere.	no
25230	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	There's - there's a -	no
25231	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	yeah, so that actually um	no
25232	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Was it twenty minutes in, I thought -	no
25233	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I forgot about that.	no
25234	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	if it was twenty minutes in then I don't know	no
25235	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well it was interesting, suddenly -	no
25236	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well, I mean, they - but I was able to can- transcribe	no
25237	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I don't remember when it is.	no
25238	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	the - the overall error rate when we first ran it was like eighty percent	no
25239	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	but i- looking at - the first sentences looked much better than that	no
25240	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	and then suddenly it turned very bad and then we noticed that the	no
25241	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	reference was always one off with the -	no
25242	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah, that might be - that might be - that might be my fault. I'm not -	no
25243	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Oh no.	no
25244	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Wel-	no
25245	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Wow.	no
25246	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Oh so that was just a parsing	no
25247	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K.	no
25248	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	No actually it was -	no
25249	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	mismatch.	no
25250	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	yeah i- it was a complicated bug because they were sometimes one off and then sometimes totally random so	no
25251	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Oh.	no
25252	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	yeah, I was pretty certain that it worked up until that time, so	no
25253	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	That's not good.	no
25254	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	um	no
25255	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah so that's what we have but that - that will be completely gone if this synch time problem	no
25256	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K.	no
25257	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Alright.	no
25258	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
25259	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	The -	no
25260	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So - so we have everything recognized but we scored only the first uh whatever, up to that time to	no
25261	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	And the only glitch -	no
25262	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	the glitch	no
25263	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	yeah.	no
25264	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	yeah.	no
25265	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So you guys know.	no
25266	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
25267	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	S-	no
25268	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Th- the	no
25269	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	The - the -	no
25270	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	sorry I haven't seen the email, what was the score?	no
25271	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So here's the	no
25272	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	well -	no
25273	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	wait we should say something about the glitch. He - he can say something about the glitch. Cuz it's - it's - it's - h- it's - it's very small - very small.	no
25274	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	yeah.	no
25275	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	oh O_K so does this glitch occur at other -	no
25276	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	There -	no
25277	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	there - there's an acoustic glitch that occurs where um the channels get slightly asynchronized	no
25278	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yep.	no
25279	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Oh.	no
25280	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Mmm.	no
25281	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Right.	no
25282	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	so the - that - that problem has gone away in the original driver	no
25283	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	believe it or not when the S_S_H key gen ran the driver paused for a fraction of a second	no
25284	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Hmm.	no
25285	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Hmm.	no
25286	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	and so the channels get a little asynchronous and so if you listen to it in the middle there's a little part where it starts doing - doing click sounds.	no
25287	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	And is it only once that that happens?	no
25288	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So -	no
25289	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	But	no
25290	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	yeah it - right once in the middle.	no
25291	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K.	no
25292	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	There's - the previous page has some more information about sort of what was wrong but	no
25293	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	so -	no
25294	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	so un- unsurprisingly Adam is the golden voice, you see this here?	no
25295	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Um	no
25296	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	S-	no
25297	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K so that's actually	no
25298	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	and it -	no
25299	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	But that shouldn't affect anything	no
25300	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	"yeah yeah ""bah"""	no
25301	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	It - y- it's - O_K no -	no
25302	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	What happens is it actually affects the script that Don - I mean if we know about it then I guess it could always be checked for it but they	no
25303	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Huh.	no
25304	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well the acoustic one shouldn't do anything.	no
25305	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I agree. I agree.	no
25306	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah, I don't know exactly what affected it but I'll - I'll talk to you about it, I'll show you the point.	no
25307	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I - I have -	no
25308	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	But	no
25309	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah. It - it had no effect on my transcription, you know, I mean I - I had no trouble hearing it and - and having time bins but	no
25310	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
25311	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
25312	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I - I do remember -	no
25313	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Mmm.	no
25314	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I do remember seeing once the transcriber produce an incorrect X_M_L file where one of the synch numbers was incorrect.	no
25315	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	there was a -	no
25316	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Oh.	no
25317	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	That's what happened.	no
25318	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well, the - the synch time - the synch numbers have more significant digits than they should, right? There's things that are l- in smaller increments than a frame.	no
25319	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
25320	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Oh.	no
25321	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	There was -	no
25322	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Where - where they weren't monotonic.	no
25323	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	yeah, I mean -	no
25324	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
25325	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Oh, interesting.	no
25326	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Oh O_K so that's	no
25327	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	And so then, I mean you look at that and it's got you know more than three significant digits in a synch time then that can't be right so	no
25328	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Hmm.	no
25329	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Oh. Yeah.	no
25330	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	yeah sounds like a bug.	no
25331	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Mmm.	no
25332	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	anyway it's - it's just - that's why we only have twenty minutes but there's a significant	no
25333	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Non-zero?	no
25334	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	amount of -	no
25335	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Um there are like more -	no
25336	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	The other one I saw was that it	no
25337	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	cuz there's a lot of zeros I tacked on just because of the way the script ran, I mean but there were- there was a point.	no
25338	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	yeah.	no
25339	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah that was fine. That - that was O_K.	no
25340	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	The other one I saw was non- non-monotonic synch times and that definitely indicra- indicates a bug.	no
25341	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K.	no
25342	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Uh.	no
25343	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well that would really be a problem, yeah. So anyway these are just the ones that are the prebug	no
25344	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
25345	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	for one meeting.	no
25346	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	um and what's -	no
25347	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So that's very encouraging.	no
25348	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	which - this is really encouraging cuz this is free recognition, there's no	no
25349	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
25350	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Cool.	no
25351	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Mmm.	no
25352	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I mean the language model for Switchboard is totally different so you can see some like	no
25353	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Trent Lott.	no
25354	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	this Trent Lott which um I mean these are sort of funny ones, there's a lot of perfect ones and good ones and all the references, I mean you can read them and	no
25355	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	It'll get those though.	no
25356	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	when we get more results you can look through and see but	no
25357	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I	no
25358	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Mm-hmm.	no
25359	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	and as I said I would like to look at the lattices because it sounded like even the ones it got wrong it sort of got it right?	no
25360	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	um it's pretty good.	no
25361	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well so I guess we can generate	no
25362	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Sounds likes?	no
25363	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Mm-hmm.	no
25364	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	There are a fair number of errors that are, you know where - got the plural S_ wrong or the inflection on the verb wrong.	no
25365	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	um	no
25366	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	"Yeah, and who cares? And - and there were lots of - of course the ""uh uh""-s, ""in on""-s"	no
25367	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Mmm, so if -	no
25368	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	there's -	no
25369	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	No those are actually	no
25370	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	"""of uh""-s."	no
25371	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
25372	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	a lot of the errors I think are out of vocabulary, so is it like P_Z_M is three words, it's P_Z_M, I mean there's nothing	no
25373	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Mm-hmm.	no
25374	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Mm-hmm.	no
25375	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Right.	no
25376	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	There's no language model for P_Z_M	no
25377	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Ri- ri- right.	no
25378	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	or um	no
25379	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Did you say there's no language for P_Z_M?	no
25380	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	No language model, I mean those -	no
25381	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Do you mean - so every time someone says P_Z_M it's an error?	no
25382	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Maybe we shouldn't say P_Z_M in these meetings.	no
25383	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well - well there's all kinds of other stuff like Jimlet and	no
25384	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah, that's right, Jimlet.	no
25385	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I mean	no
25386	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	um anyway there -	no
25387	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well, we don't even know what that means, so I	no
25388	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	so	no
25389	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah, that's right.	no
25390	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	so, I mean the bottom line is even though it's not a huge amount of data	no
25391	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	um	no
25392	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	it should be	no
25393	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	uh reasonable to actually run recognition and be like within the scope of -	no
25394	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	of r- reasonable s- you know Switchboard this is like h- about how well we do	no
25395	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	on Switchboard-two data with the Switchboard-one trained - mostly trained recognizer and	no
25396	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Right.	no
25397	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Excellent.	no
25398	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	got sort of a different population of speakers	no
25399	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	and a different topic and they're talking about things in the news that happened after Switchboard-one so there was	no
25400	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
25401	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah so we're in better shape than we were say when we did - had the ninety-three workshop	no
25402	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Um	no
25403	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	and we were all getting like seventy percent error on Switchboard.	no
25404	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Mm-hmm.	no
25405	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Oh yeah I mean this is really, and thanks to Andreas who, I mean this is a	no
25406	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Mmm.	no
25407	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well	no
25408	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Mmm.	no
25409	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
25410	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	especially for the very first run, I mean	no
25411	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Oh it's the -	no
25412	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	eh um	no
25413	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	yeah	no
25414	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
25415	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	you - the first run I ran of Switchboard I got a hundred twenty percent word error but	no
25416	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So and what al- also this means is that um	no
25417	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Right.	no
25418	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Not Switchboard, uh Broadcast News.	no
25419	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well it's -	no
25420	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I mean there's a bunch of things in this note to various people especially I guess	no
25421	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	um with Jane that - that would help for - since we have this new data now	no
25422	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	uh in order to go from the transcripts	no
25423	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	more easily to	no
25424	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	um just the words that the recognizer would use for scoring.	no
25425	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I had to deal with some of it by hand but I think a lot of it	no
25426	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	can be automated s- by -	no
25427	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Oh one thing I guess I didn't get so	no
25428	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	you know the language model was straight from - from bigram from Switchboard	no
25429	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	the acoustic models were also from Switchboard or - or	no
25430	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
25431	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
25432	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	That's amazing.	no
25433	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So they didn't have anything from this acoustic data in yet? O_K.	no
25434	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah, so that's great.	no
25435	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	No.	no
25436	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	And actually - we actually um used Switchboard telephone bandwidth models	no
25437	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	That's amazing.	no
25438	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I was just gonna say, yeah.	no
25439	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	which I guess	no
25440	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
25441	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well that's - those are the only we- ones there are, I mean	no
25442	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	so that's the on- that's the only acoustic training data that we have a lot of and I guess	no
25443	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
25444	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Right.	no
25445	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	um there's not a huge amount of difference	no
25446	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	going from - it's - it's not like we probably lose a huge amount but we won't know because we don't have any full band models for s- conversational speech.	no
25447	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Right.	no
25448	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	It's probably not as bad as going f- using full band models on	no
25449	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So.	no
25450	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	telephone band speech right?	no
25451	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Oh yeah. Yeah.	no
25452	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Right. Right, so it's - so	no
25453	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah, but for Broadcast News when we - we played around between the two there wasn't a huge	no
25454	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Right, it was not a big deal.	no
25455	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah so I wou- so that's good.	no
25456	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I should - I should say that -	no
25457	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	loss.	no
25458	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Although combining em worked well.	no
25459	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	the language model is not just Switchboard it's also -	no
25460	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I mean there's uh	no
25461	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	actually more data is from Broadcast News but with a little less weight	no
25462	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
25463	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Uh-huh.	no
25464	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Like Trent Lott must have been from	no
25465	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	uh because	no
25466	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	mm-hmm, right.	no
25467	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Um	no
25468	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	By the way just -	no
25469	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	for fun we also ran, I mean our complete system starts by doing ge- a gender detection	no
25470	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Mm-hmm.	no
25471	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	so just for the heck of it I ran that	no
25472	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	And it said a hundred percent male?	no
25473	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	um and it might be reassuring for everybody to know that it got all the genders right. Yeah so	no
25474	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	The j-	no
25475	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Oh it did?	no
25476	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Oh that's - I'm glad.	no
25477	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	It got all two genders?	no
25478	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah	no
25479	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	but you know Jane and Adam have you kn- about equal performance and uh	no
25480	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	and that's interesting cuz I think the - their language models are quite different so	no
25481	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	and I - I'm pretty sure from listening to Eric	no
25482	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	that, you know given the words he was saying and given his pronunciation that the reason that he's so much worse	no
25483	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	is the lapel.	no
25484	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Right.	no
25485	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	That makes a lot of sense, yeah.	no
25486	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
25487	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So it's nice now if we can just sort of eliminate the lapel one when -	no
25488	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Very possible.	no
25489	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah I - I - I would bet on that too cuz he certainly in that - when as a - as a burp user he was - he was a pretty uh strong one.	no
25490	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	when we get new microphones that would be worth it um	no
25491	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Sheep.	no
25492	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah he - he - he sounded to me just from - he sounded like a, what's it a sheep or a goat?	no
25493	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
25494	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	A sheep. Baah.	no
25495	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Sheep.	no
25496	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Sheep, right.	no
25497	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah. Sheep is good.	no
25498	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Sounded good.	no
25499	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
25500	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Right so um	no
25501	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Mm-hmm.	no
25502	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	so I guess the good news is that	no
25503	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	and - and again this is without	no
25504	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	a lot of the sort of bells and whistles that we c- can do with the S_R_I system	no
25505	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	and we'll have more data and we can also start to	no
25506	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	maybe adapt the language models once we have enough meetings. So this is only twenty minutes of one meeting with no - no	no
25507	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I mean clearly there are um with just a small amount of uh actual	no
25508	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	tailoring at all.	no
25509	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	meeting transcriptions uh thrown into the language model you can probably do quite a bit better because	no
25510	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
25511	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Or just dictionary.	no
25512	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	the -	no
25513	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	The voca- the vocabulary especially yeah.	no
25514	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah, so.	no
25515	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Not that much the vocabulary actually I think - um well we have to see but -	no
25516	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
25517	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	it's uh -	no
25518	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	It's pretty good um	no
25519	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Have to add P_Z_M and so on but	no
25520	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	so then	no
25521	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	And I have to try it on the far field mike yeah.	no
25522	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	P_Z_M and then there's things like	no
25523	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	for the transcription I got when someone has a digit in the transcript I don't know if they said, you know one one or eleven and I don't know if they said	no
25524	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	there's things like that where, you know the	no
25525	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	um we'll probably have to ask the transcribers to indicate some of those kinds of things but	no
25526	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	in general it was really good and I'm hoping - and this is -	no
25527	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	this is good news because that means the force alignments should be good and if the force alignments, I mean it's good news anyway but if the force alignments are good we can get all kinds of information.	no
25528	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	For example about, you know prosodic information and speaker overlaps and so forth directly from the aligned times.	no
25529	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Um so that'll be something that	no
25530	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	actually in order to assess the forced alignment	no
25531	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	um we need s- some linguists or some people to look at it and say are these boundaries in about the right place.	no
25532	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Because it's just gonna give us time marks so.	no
25533	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	But you know -	no
25534	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well we've done that for one meeting.	no
25535	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	For forced alignment.	no
25536	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Uh oh oh f- not for words I'm sorry just for overlaps is we did it for not - not for words.	no
25537	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Ye- right.	no
25538	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Right.	no
25539	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So this would be like if you take the words	no
25540	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	um you know and force align them on all the individual close talk uh close talking mikes	no
25541	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	then how good are these sort of in reality and then I was thinking it -	no
25542	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Right.	no
25543	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So we might want to take twenty minutes and do a closer word level transcription.	no
25544	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Maybe actually mark the word boundaries.	no
25545	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Oh or - i- have someone look at the alignments uh maybe a linguist who can say	no
25546	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	um	no
25547	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	you know roughly if these are O_K and how far away they are.	no
25548	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
25549	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Um but I think it's gotta be pretty good because otherwise the word recognition would be really b- crummy.	no
25550	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Right, right.	no
25551	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	It wouldn't necessarily be the other way around, if the wor- word recognition was crummy the alignment might be O_K	no
25552	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	but if the word recognition is this good	no
25553	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	the alignment should be pretty good.	no
25554	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So	no
25555	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	that's about it.	no
25556	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I wonder if this is a good thing or a bad thing though, I mean if we're pr-	no
25557	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I r-	no
25558	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	That we're starting so well?	no
25559	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	yeah if we're producing a database that everybody's gonna do well on	no
25560	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Oh	no
25561	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Don't worry about it w- d- that's	no
25562	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	that's the close talking mikes. Try it on the P_Z_Ms and - and	no
25563	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah, which - I would - which - well n- n- n- n-	no
25564	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.	no
25565	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So the real value of the database is	no
25566	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah, abso- well no but	no
25567	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I mean there's still just the w- the percentages and, I mean they're not - a- as we've talked about before there's probably overlaps	no
25568	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	This i- yeah. This is not that good.	no
25569	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	there's probably overlaps in - in	no
25570	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	uh in fair number in Switchboard as well so	no
25571	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	but -	no
25572	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	but there's other phenomena, it's a meeting, it's a different thing and there's lots of stuff to learn with the close talking mikes	no
25573	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	but uh yeah certainly I'd like to see as soon as we could, I mean maybe	no
25574	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	get some of the glitches out of the way but soon as we could how well it does with say	no
25575	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	with the P_Z_Ms or maybe even one of the	no
25576	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Right.	no
25577	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	and uh see if it's, you know is it a hundred twenty percent or maybe it's not maybe if	no
25578	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	with some adaptation you get this down to fifty percent or forty-five percent or something and - and then if for the P_Z_M it's seventy or something like that that's actually something we could sort of	no
25579	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	work with a little bit	no
25580	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah. No I think it's really, I mean this way we least have a baseline we know that for instance the transcripts are very good so once you can get to the words that the recognizer which is a total subset of the things you need to understand the - the text	no
25581	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	so	no
25582	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	um yeah they're pretty good so and - and it's	no
25583	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	converting automatically from the X_M_L to the	no
25584	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	chopping up the wave forms and so forth it's not the case that	no
25585	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	the end of one	no
25586	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	utterance is in the next segment and things like that which we had more problems with in Switchboard	no
25587	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	so that's good.	no
25588	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	And um	no
25589	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	let's see there was one more thing I wanted to -	no
25590	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	to mention - I can't remember um	no
25591	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Sorry can't remember.	no
25592	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	anyway it's - well it was, I mean I really didn't do this myself so Andreas set up this recognizer and - by the way the recognizer all the files I'm moving to S_R_I and running everything there so	no
25593	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Congratulations	no
25594	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
25595	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	is really great.	no
25596	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah, it's really good.	no
25597	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I brought back just these result files and people can look at them um	no
25598	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	so	no
25599	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	We - we talked about setting up the	no
25600	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	S_R_I recognizer here.	no
25601	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	That's -	no
25602	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	you know if - if there are more machines	no
25603	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	um	no
25604	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	uh here plus people can - could	no
25605	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	run their own	no
25606	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	uh you know variants of - of - of the recognition	no
25607	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Um.	no
25608	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah and - well certainly if the recognition as opposed to training, yeah.	no
25609	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Seems reasonable.	no
25610	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I need t- Hmm.	no
25611	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
25612	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I need to ask one question.	no
25613	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
25614	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Which is um	no
25615	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	so this issue	no
25616	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	of the uh legalistic aspects of the pre-sent- you know pre-adapted -	no
25617	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah, well, so what I mean is um	no
25618	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	the -	no
25619	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	uh the data that you take into S_R_I, first - first question, you're maintaining it in - in a place that wouldn't be publicly readable that - that kind of stuff, right?	no
25620	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	U- um	no
25621	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	From the outside world or	no
25622	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	By uh people uh who are not associated with this project.	no
25623	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	It's human subjects issues, I told you about that.	no
25624	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Oh.	no
25625	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Exactly.	no
25626	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Um oh. Well O_K we have n- no names.	no
25627	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Although I sh- um	no
25628	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	That - that's not the issue, it's just the audio data itself, until people have a chance to	no
25629	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	de- audio data itself?	no
25630	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Mm-hmm, exactly.	no
25631	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	edit it.	no
25632	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Uh so well I can - I can protect my directories through there. Right now they're not - they're in the speech group directories which - so I will - I didn't know that actually.	no
25633	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
25634	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Great.	no
25635	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah so we just have to go through this process of having people approve the transcriptions, say it's O_K.	no
25636	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah O_K.	no
25637	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah, we had to get them to approve em and then i- cuz - cuz the other question I was gonna ask is if we're having um you know it's	no
25638	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Right O_K.	no
25639	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	but this - this meeting that you have, no problem cuz I - I well I mean I - I speak for myself but - but I think that we didn't do anything that but	no
25640	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	It's us.	no
25641	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	well anyway so	no
25642	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	uh haven't had the chance to be reviewed by the subjects and I don't know how that stands, I mean if you - if you get fantastic results and it's involving	no
25643	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	That's true.	no
25644	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	which later end up being	no
25645	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	lessened by, you know certain elisions, then I don't know but I wanted to raise that issue, that's all.	no
25646	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well we, I mean once we get all this streamlined it may be sh- it - hopefully it will be fairly quick but	no
25647	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	we get the transcriptions, people approve them and so on it's just that we're	no
25648	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Alright we need to work at a system for doing that approval so that we can send people the transcripts and get back any bleeps that they want	no
25649	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Great.	no
25650	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Mmm.	no
25651	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
25652	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah actually the bleeps are also an issue I thought.	no
25653	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	It's gonna be a rare thing that there's a bleep for the most part.	no
25654	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	U- uh actually I had a question about the downsampling, um I don't know who, I mean how this was done but	no
25655	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Don did this.	no
25656	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	is -	no
25657	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	is there - are there any um	no
25658	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	issues with downsampling because I know that	no
25659	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	the recognizer	no
25660	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	um	no
25661	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	that we use h- can do it sort of on the fly um so we wouldn't have to have it eh you know do it uh	no
25662	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	explicitly beforehand.	no
25663	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	And is there any um i- are there other d- sev- uh-	no
25664	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	is there more than one way to do the downsampling where one might be better than another?	no
25665	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	There are lots of w-	no
25666	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K.	no
25667	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	put on, like anti-aliasing stuff.	no
25668	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Right.	no
25669	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K.	no
25670	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So - so the - th-	no
25671	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I don't think we even know which one	no
25672	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I assume you're using syncat to do it?	no
25673	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	No, I'm using uh S_N	no
25674	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Or sound resample?	no
25675	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	S_N_D uh	no
25676	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Re- re- ref- yeah.	no
25677	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Resample. Yeah and Dan's archaic acronyms.	no
25678	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	are resample.	no
25679	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	R_S_M_P.	no
25680	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah, I don't really.	no
25681	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Missing all the vowels.	no
25682	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I just - yeah I found it.	no
25683	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Not all of them.	no
25684	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Some of the vowels, almost all the vowels, that's the hard part.	no
25685	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So - so the other thing we should try is to just take the original wave forms, I mean segment them but not downsample them.	no
25686	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	And a few of the consonants.	no
25687	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah we could - we could try that and - and	no
25688	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah, that's -	no
25689	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	And - and feed them to - feed them to the S_R_I recognizer and see if - if the S_R_I front-end does something.	no
25690	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	compare	no
25691	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
25692	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I suspect that's sort of premature optimization, but	no
25693	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Sure.	no
25694	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	We can try it. I - I only downsampled them first cuz I was	no
25695	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I mean that's just one line - that's one line of code to comment at so	no
25696	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well -	no
25697	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	yeah	no
25698	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Right and - and it doesn't - is no more work	no
25699	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Mm-hmm.	no
25700	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
25701	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well they're just bigger to transfer, that's why I s- downsampled them before but	no
25702	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	you know for us.	no
25703	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well but they're only twice as big so	no
25704	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well I mean that was - if it's the same then we can downsample here but if it's -	no
25705	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I mean it's - it's just a	no
25706	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Although those eighty meg files take a while to copy into my directories so, but no, I mean it's not - i- it wouldn't be a problem if you're interested in it - it would -	no
25707	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
25708	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	We could try that.	no
25709	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah I mean it would be uh you know it would probably take uh about um	no
25710	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	you know minus the transfer time it would - it would take uh	no
25711	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
25712	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	you know ten minutes to try and - and - and	no
25713	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	It's about a fifty minute drive, right?	no
25714	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well it takes more disk space too so I was just -	no
25715	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	And - and if for some reason we see that it works better then we might investigate why and, you know, what -	no
25716	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Mmm. In the front-end we could do that.	no
25717	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah. Yeah.	no
25718	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So you just train - just different filters and so you're just wondering whether the filter is	no
25719	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah, I -	no
25720	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah, I can imagine it would be -	no
25721	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Right. Right.	no
25722	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I mean I guess there's some -	no
25723	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So we could try that with this particular twenty minutes of speech and sort of see if there's any differences.	no
25724	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	You know a- at some point someone might have optimized whatever filtering is done for the actual recognition	no
25725	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Hmm.	no
25726	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	um performance.	no
25727	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So in other words	no
25728	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Right.	no
25729	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	right, so	no
25730	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	It just seems to me that, you know small changes to the language model and the vocabulary will so swamp that that it may be premature to worry about that.	no
25731	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I mean so one is a half a percent better than the other	no
25732	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I don't think that gives you any information.	no
25733	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well it's just as easy to - to give you the sixteen K_ individual, it was just more disk space you know for storing them so	no
25734	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yep.	no
25735	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Are you -	no
25736	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	are you using uh	no
25737	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	uh mel cepstrum or P_L_P over there?	no
25738	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Mel cepstrum.	no
25739	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So probably doesn't matter.	no
25740	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well we could try.	no
25741	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	There's - there's your answer.	no
25742	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	But - but it wouldn't hurt to try, yeah.	no
25743	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	That's what I would assume but you never know, you know.	no
25744	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	so	no
25745	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Sure.	no
25746	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Just - Mm-hmm.	no
25747	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	No the reason I say this P_L_P uses uh auto-regressive filtering and uh modeling and so	no
25748	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Mm-hmm.	no
25749	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	it can be sensitive to the kind of filtering that you're doing but uh uh mel cepstrum	no
25750	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	uh	no
25751	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	might not - b- you wouldn't expect to be so much but	no
25752	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well we can try it if you generate like the same set of files just up to that point where we stopped anyway and just sti- stick them somewhere and I'll rerun it with	no
25753	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah, it's - it's really not a problem.	no
25754	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Actually, no. Don't stop.	no
25755	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Keep going.	no
25756	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	we're actually using the entire conversation to estimate the speaker parameters, so	no
25757	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
25758	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	shouldn't use - you should s- you know, get	no
25759	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah, I mean I'll - I have to do is eh e- the reference file would stay the same, it's just the individual segments would be approximately twice as long and I could just replace them with the bigger ones in the directory, that's not a problem.	no
25760	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K.	no
25761	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
25762	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Right.	no
25763	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Mmm.	no
25764	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Right.	no
25765	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Right.	no
25766	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
25767	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Right.	no
25768	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I mean I corrected all - I mean I hand-edited the whole - the whole meeting so that can be run it's just -	no
25769	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Once we get the - the bug out.	no
25770	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Mmm.	no
25771	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	One - one question which is I - I had the impression	no
25772	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
25773	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Mm-hmm.	no
25774	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	that w- that I transcribed that	no
25775	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	um that there was already automatic downsampling occurring, is that	no
25776	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I thought that in order to	no
25777	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yep.	no
25778	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	so it was -	no
25779	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	There's one level that's already happening right here.	no
25780	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	so it's like there's already down	no
25781	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K.	no
25782	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	This is being recorded at forty-eight kilohertz.	no
25783	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Oh.	no
25784	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Right. And it gets downsampled to sixteen.	no
25785	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K.	no
25786	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Which is more that anybody needs so	no
25787	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	And that's actually said in your meeting, that's how I know that.	no
25788	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Hmm.	no
25789	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Oh O_K.	no
25790	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	That's exactly, and that's how I know it.	no
25791	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
25792	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	It's a digital audio orientation for the board it's in the monitor so it's	no
25793	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Right.	no
25794	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Mmm.	no
25795	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Thank God it's not	no
25796	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So -	no
25797	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Is eight kilohertz -	no
25798	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
25799	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	And I have no idea what filter it's using, so	no
25800	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	is - is eighty kilohertz generally accepted as like standard for voice?	no
25801	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Telephone.	no
25802	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	For telephone stuff.	no
25803	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Telephone.	no
25804	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah that's what I was gonna say, I mean like -	no
25805	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	so	no
25806	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So it's - it's - it's just that	no
25807	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	they were operating from Switchboard which was a completely telephone database and so that was a standard for that	no
25808	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Oh, I see, so. O_K.	no
25809	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So sixteen seems to be pretty typical for	no
25810	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	sixteen s-	no
25811	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Right.	no
25812	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Sixteen is more common for - for uh	no
25813	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	with this sort of thing.	no
25814	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	broadband stuff that isn't -	no
25815	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	That isn't music.	no
25816	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	that isn't music and isn't telephone, yeah.	no
25817	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	And I guess if you're comparing like -	no
25818	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	uh if you wanna run recognition on the P_Z_M stuff you would want	no
25819	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	you don't want to downsample the wh- that right?	no
25820	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Why is that?	no
25821	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I don't know.	no
25822	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well I don- I mean if it's any better	no
25823	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	No actually I would think that you would - you would get better - you'd get better high frequencies in the local mike.	no
25824	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	All the way around I'd think.	no
25825	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Uh but who knows? I mean we do-	no
25826	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah well we could try it.	no
25827	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
25828	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	We're gonna have plenty of low frequency on the P_Z_Ms with the fans.	no
25829	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K.	no
25830	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
25831	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Uh yeah.	no
25832	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	yes
25833	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
25834	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Oh yeah there was just one more thing I wanted to say which is totally unrelated to the recognition except that um	no
25835	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	well -	no
25836	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	well it's sort of related but um good news also	no
25837	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	uh I got - well Chuck Fillmore agreed to record meetings but he had too many people in his meetings and that's too bad cuz they're very animated and	no
25838	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	but uh Jerry also agreed so uh we're starting on - on	no
25839	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	They're less animated.	no
25840	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Dot E_D_U?	no
25841	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	and um so that's gonna start Monday and one of the things that I was realizing is um	no
25842	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	it would be really great if anyone has any ideas on some kind of	no
25843	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	time synchronous way that people in the meeting can make a comment to the person whose gonna transcribe it	no
25844	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	or - or put a	no
25845	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	push a button or something	no
25846	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	"when they wanna make a note about ""oh boy you should probably erase those last few"" or"	no
25847	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	"uh ""wait I want this not to be recorded now"" or"	no
25848	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Weren't we gonna	no
25849	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	uh something like that s-	no
25850	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	do something with a pad at one point?	no
25851	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	The cross pads?	no
25852	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah, we could do it with the cross pads.	no
25853	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Cuz I was thinking you know if - if the person who sets up the meeting isn't there and it's a group that we don't know	no
25854	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	"um and this came up talking to - to Jerry also that you know is there any way for them to indicate - to make sure that the qu- request that they have that they make explicitly get addressed somehow so I don't know if anyone has ideas or - you could even write down ""oh it's about three twenty five and"" -"	no
25855	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
25856	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well what I was just suggesting is - is we have these - this cross pad	no
25857	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah, and use that. Not a bad idea.	no
25858	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	just for this purpose and just use that and if we sink it in -	no
25859	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	That would be great.	no
25860	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	That be great.	no
25861	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	The other thing is eh I don't know if you know this or if it's a question for the mail to Dan but	no
25862	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	is this thing of two eight channel boards a maximum for this setup	no
25863	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I don't know.	no
25864	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	or could we go to a third board?	no
25865	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I don't know.	no
25866	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I'll send mail to Dan and ask. I - I think	no
25867	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	that it's the maximum we can do without a lot of effort because it's one board with two	no
25868	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Oh it is one board.	no
25869	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	digital channels.	no
25870	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	E- eight each. So it - it takes two fibers in to the one board.	no
25871	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	And so w- I think if we wanna do that - more than that	no
25872	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	we'd have to have two boards, and then you have the synchronization issue.	no
25873	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	But that's a question because that would - if it was possible	no
25874	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	cuz it is i- you know already we have a - a - a group of people in this room that cannot all be miked	no
25875	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Right.	no
25876	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	and it's not just cuz we haven't been to the store, right it's -	no
25877	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	What is the limit on each of those f- fiber channels, is it the	no
25878	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Eight.	no
25879	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	It just - it's eight channels come in, does it have do with the sampling rate?	no
25880	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	It's eight.	no
25881	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I have no idea.	no
25882	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	But each - each fiber channel has eight - eight	no
25883	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	channels	no
25884	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	and	no
25885	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	there are two ch- two fibers that go in to the card.	no
25886	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	It might be a hard limitation, I mean one thing is it - the whole thing as I said is - is all structured in terms of forty-eight kilohertz sampling so that pushes	no
25887	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So	no
25888	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	requirements up a bit but	no
25889	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
25890	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I was just wondering if - if that could change.	no
25891	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I mean then we'd also have to get another A_D_D and another mixer and all that sort of stuff.	no
25892	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	If we could drop that.	no
25893	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
25894	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So I - I'll send a mail to Dan and ask him.	no
25895	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	yes
25896	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
25897	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K on the uh are we done with that?	no
25898	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So the oth- topic is uh getting more mikes and different mikes, so I got a quote um	no
25899	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	We can fit - we have room for one more wireless	no
25900	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	and the wireless, this unit here is three fifty - three hundred fifty dollars, it - I didn't realize but we also have to get a tuner - the receiver - the other end, that's uh four thirty	no
25901	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	um	no
25902	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Wow.	no
25903	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	For - for each? I mean the tuner is four thirty for each.	no
25904	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	and then also	no
25905	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yep.	no
25906	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Wow.	no
25907	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	And we just need one more so - so	no
25908	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah at least w- we got the good ones.	no
25909	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
25910	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So that's you know something like seven hundred eighty bucks for one more of these.	no
25911	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
25912	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K.	no
25913	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Um and then also um	no
25914	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	It turns out that the connector that this thing uses is proprietary of Sony	no
25915	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Oh.	no
25916	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	believe it or not and Sony only sells this headset.	no
25917	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Mmm.	no
25918	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So if we wanna use a different set - headset the solution that the guy suggested and they - apparently lots of people have done	no
25919	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	is Sony will sell you the jack	no
25920	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	with just wires coming out the end	no
25921	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	and then you can buy a headset that has pigtail and solder it yourself.	no
25922	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	And that's the other solution and so the jacks are forty bucks apiece	no
25923	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	and the - he recommended um	no
25924	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	a crown C_M three eleven A_E	no
25925	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	headset for two hundred bucks apiece.	no
25926	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	There isn't this some sort of thing that plugs in, you actually have to go and do the soldering yourself?	no
25927	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Becau- the reason is	no
25928	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	the only - only thing you can get that will plug into this is this mike	no
25929	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	No I understand.	no
25930	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	or just the	no
25931	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	The reason I ask is these sort of handmade	no
25932	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	connector.	no
25933	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	uh wiring jobs fall apart in use	no
25934	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	so the other thing is to see if we can uh get them	no
25935	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	to do a custom job and put it together for this.	no
25936	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Oh I'm sure they would, they would just charge us, so.	no
25937	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well, and they'd probably want quantity too, they'd	no
25938	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well	no
25939	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	no they'll just charge us more, so it's - this	no
25940	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Mmm.	no
25941	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So - so my question is should we go ahead and get na- nine identical head-mounted crown mikes?	no
25942	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Not before having one come here and have some people try it out.	no
25943	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K.	no
25944	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Because there's no point in doing that if it's not gonna be any better.	no
25945	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So why don't we get one of these with the crown with a different headset?	no
25946	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
25947	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	And - and see if that works.	no
25948	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	And see if it's preferable and if it is then we'll get more.	no
25949	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Comfort.	no
25950	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
25951	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
25952	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Cuz I mean I think the microphones are O_K it's just the - the	no
25953	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Right, it's just they're not comfortable to wear.	no
25954	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Right.	no
25955	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Could make our own handbands and	no
25956	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Um, and he said they don't have any of these in stock but they have them in L_A and so it will take about a week to get here.	no
25957	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah well it's -	no
25958	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Um so O_K to just go order?	no
25959	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	We're in this for the long term, yeah. Just order it.	no
25960	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K and who is the contact if I wanna do an invoice cuz I think that's how we did it before.	no
25961	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	It's a lot of money for a handband.	no
25962	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
25963	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Uh we'll do this off-line, yeah.	no
25964	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	It's a long time to get from L_A.	no
25965	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K.	no
25966	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	And then nine channels is the maximum we can do, so.	no
25967	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Uh y- right cuz - so one is for the daisy chain so that's fifteen instead of sixteen and there's six on the table so that's nine.	no
25968	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Without getting more stuff.	no
25969	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Right.	no
25970	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Can I ask a really dumb question?	no
25971	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
25972	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Probably.	no
25973	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Is -	no
25974	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	you know the extra people for the times they wanna talk	no
25975	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	that -	no
25976	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I mean -	no
25977	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	That's a good idea.	no
25978	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	That's not a dumb question, it's a good idea, yeah.	no
25979	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well I mean -	no
25980	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Like uh	no
25981	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I'm just not sure how we would handle that in the	no
25982	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	That's like the Conch.	no
25983	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	like you know Jerry Springer thing, you know r-	no
25984	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well but -	no
25985	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Like at conferences	no
25986	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	well but there might be a way to say that there are gonna be these different people	no
25987	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	so nail the chairs down.	no
25988	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	um	no
25989	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	and I don't know identifying somehow? You know I was just thinking of Jerry Springer.	no
25990	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
25991	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah, somehow. It's not a bad idea.	no
25992	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	No that -	no
25993	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	no - no that's a very - if we can't get another board and even if we can I have a feeling they'll be some work.	no
25994	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I mean for the few times that you might wanna have that.	no
25995	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	The Springer mike.	no
25996	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Let's figure that we have eight which are set up and then there's a ninth which is passed around to -	no
25997	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	A hand-held, yeah.	no
25998	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	that's a good idea	no
25999	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Infinite expansion.	no
26000	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Right.	no
26001	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Kind of rules out overlap but -	no
26002	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well or also for you know if people are not	no
26003	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
26004	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well we could just hand around the lapel.	no
26005	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Uh no - no that's -	no
26006	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Rather than get a - do you want a handset?	no
26007	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	No not the lapel.	no
26008	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	No.	no
26009	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well I mean is the - is the hand-held really any better?	no
26010	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yes.	no
26011	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K.	no
26012	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I don't know but I d- I know the lapel is really suboptimal.	no
26013	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	No it -	no
26014	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Is awful?	no
26015	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	no it depends on the hand-held but hand - many hand-helds are built wi- with sort of uh anti-shock sort of things so that it - it is less	no
26016	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	uh susceptible to hand noises.	no
26017	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Mm-hmm.	no
26018	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	If you hold the lapel mike i- you just get all k- sorts of junk.	no
26019	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Right.	no
26020	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I mean the ones they really pass around must be sort of O_K.	no
26021	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K.	no
26022	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	so	no
26023	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So I wonder if they have one that will hook up.	no
26024	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
26025	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	They have -	no
26026	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	What?	no
26027	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I wonder if they have one that will hook up to this or whether again we'll have to wire it ourselves.	no
26028	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well, you wouldn't want it to hook there you'd just want it to hook into the receiver in the other room, right?	no
26029	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	No that's uh - you need a transmitter.	no
26030	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	What?	no
26031	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Is th- isn't that built into the mike?	no
26032	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Oh I see. Get a - get a different radio, yeah.	no
26033	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah just these ones that they	no
26034	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
26035	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	pass around with no you know wireless	no
26036	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	But you need a ra- but it has to correspond to the receiver.	no
26037	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Have a little antenna coming out the bottom.	no
26038	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	It's gonna be much easier to get one of these and just plug in a mike, isn't it?	no
26039	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	But then the mike has to h-	no
26040	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Do you have to hand it around and if you have two pieces of	no
26041	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
26042	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	No no -	no
26043	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Right.	no
26044	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	so right, so this is a good point, so yeah you have these - these mikes with a little antenna on the end right?	no
26045	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K. And do you think you would be able to use the same receiver?	no
26046	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I don't know. You'll have to check with them, yeah.	no
26047	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K I'll - I'll ask. Yeah.	no
26048	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	It's just a frequency.	no
26049	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	But that's - that's a great idea and then just sort of have that as the - and then you can have groups of twenty people or whatever and - and uh	no
26050	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah because there's only I mean as Andreas pointed out actually I think in the large - the larger the group the less	no
26051	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Pretty soon.	no
26052	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	interaction - the less people are talking	no
26053	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Mmm, yeah.	no
26054	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	um over each other - it just - there might be a lot of people that speak once or twice and	no
26055	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Right.	no
26056	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Um	no
26057	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Off you go, yeah.	no
26058	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Gotta go.	no
26059	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K so I guess people who have to leave can leave and do we have anything else to discuss or should we just do digits?	yes
26060	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K so I guess people who have to leave can leave and do we have anything else to discuss or should we just do digits?	no
26061	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I - I thought of some extra - a couple of extra things I'd like to mention.	no
26062	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K.	no
26063	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	One of them is to give you a status in terms of the transcriptions so far.	no
26064	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So um as of last night	no
26065	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	uh	no
26066	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	um I'd assigned twelve hours and they'd finished nine and my goal was to have eleven done by the end of the month, I think that by tomorrow we'll have ten.	no
26067	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So they're still working.	no
26068	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Uh it's great - I j- and this - I got this email from Jane at like two in the morning or something so it's really great	no
26069	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Pretty close, that's good.	no
26070	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yep, that's good.	no
26071	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Wow.	no
26072	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	It's working out, thanks.	no
26073	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	It's really great.	no
26074	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Thanks.	no
26075	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	And then um	no
26076	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	also an idea for another meeting, which would be to have the transcribers talk about the data	no
26077	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	That's a great idea.	no
26078	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yep, that'd be very interesting. I'd love to hear what they have to say.	no
26079	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Super idea.	no
26080	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
26081	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	That's a great idea cuz I'd like to g- have it recorded so that we can remember all the little things, that's a great idea.	no
26082	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
26083	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So if we got them to talk about this meeting, it would be a meta - meta meeting.	no
26084	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
26085	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah, exa-	no
26086	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Now you have eight transcribers and there's ten of us so how do we do this, is the only thing.	no
26087	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Or just have them talk amongst themselves.	no
26088	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Have them have their own meeting.	no
26089	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well that's what I'm thinking, yeah.	no
26090	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	And have	no
26091	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Have them talk about the data	no
26092	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Oh.	no
26093	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	that would be great.	no
26094	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	and they - and they've made observations to me like they say	no
26095	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	uh you know this meeting that we think has so much overlap, in fact it does	no
26096	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	but there are other groups of similar size that have very little, you know it's part of it's - it's the norm of the group and all that and they have various observations that would be fun, I think.	no
26097	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	That's a great idea.	no
26098	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
26099	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah, I'd like to hear what they s- say.	no
26100	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Be great.	no
26101	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K.	no
26102	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So maybe we could - they could have a meeting	no
26103	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	more or less without us that - to do this and we should record it	no
26104	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	and then maybe one or two of them could come to one of these meetings and - and could you know could tell us about it.	no
26105	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
26106	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Give us a status.	no
26107	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
26108	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Oh good. O_K.	no
26109	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
26110	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	What - what	no
26111	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	That would be weird.	no
26112	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	yeah that's right.	no
26113	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah exactly, yeah.	no
26114	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
26115	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Great.	no
26116	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Um that's a great idea. I'm really sorry I have to g-	no
26117	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Great.	no
26118	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Super.	no
26119	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	no I have to go as well.	no
26120	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K.	yes
26121	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K.	no
26122	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	And then I wanted to also um say something about the Fiscus uh uh John - John Fiscus visit tomorrow.	no
26123	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	And	no
26124	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Which is to say that w- it'll be from nine to one	no
26125	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	that I'm going to	no
26126	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	uh uh offer the organization - allow him to uh adjust it if he wishes but	no
26127	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	to be basically in three parts, the acoustic part coming first which would be	no
26128	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	basically the room engineering aspects um other things	no
26129	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	and he'll be also presenting what NIST is doing and -	no
26130	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	and	no
26131	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	uh then	no
26132	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	uh number two would be sort of a	no
26133	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	the - the transcription process so this would be a focus on like presegmentation and the modifications to the - the multitrans interface which allows more refined encoding of the beginnings and ends of the overlapping segments	no
26134	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	which uh Dave Gelbart's been doing and then um	no
26135	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	uh and of course the presegmentation Thilo's been doing	no
26136	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	and then um the third part would - and again he has some stuff that's i- relevant with respect to NIST and then the third one would be focus on transcription standards so	no
26137	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	at NIST he's interested in this establishment of a global encoding standard I guess I would say and I want it, you know k- yeah	no
26138	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	see what they're doing and also present	no
26139	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	what - what	no
26140	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	we've chosen as ours and - and discuss that kind of thing.	no
26141	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	And so but he's only here	no
26142	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	S-	no
26143	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K.	no
26144	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	And everybody who wants to attend is welcome.	no
26145	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So yeah.	no
26146	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Oh, where you're gonna meet?	no
26147	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Here mostly but I've also reserved the BARCO room	no
26148	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	um eh to figure out how that works in terms of like maybe having a live demonstration.	no
26149	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K but the nine o'cl- nine o'clock will be i- be in here. Yeah, O_K.	no
26150	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah. Mm-hmm.	no
26151	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I assume we're not gonna try to record it?	no
26152	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Oh I think that would be hard, yeah.	no
26153	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah, I think just adds -	no
26154	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Alright.	no
26155	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
26156	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Um good.	no
26157	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Thank you though, uh-huh.	yes
26158	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Thank you though, uh-huh.	no
26159	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So maybe do digits and	no
26160	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
26161	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Unless there's anything else?	no
26162	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	recess?	no
26163	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
26164	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Do digital	no
26165	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Uh O_K.	no
26166	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
26167	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Uh should y- we make him wear Andreas' mike or would that just be too confusing?	no
26168	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
26169	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	No I don't think it's confusing. Well, it doesn't confuse me.	no
26170	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	When we do this in the key - in the key - in the key it has to indicate that channel change, right?	no
26171	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Does it mess up the forms?	no
26172	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Uh yeah I just don't know how we would do that, so.	no
26173	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well i- have a time mark.	no
26174	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I mean other than free - free form.	no
26175	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	The on switch is here on the -	no
26176	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
26177	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	on the top there.	no
26178	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K.	no
26179	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	And just clip it to your collar.	no
26180	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	That's fine.	no

26184	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Currently I'm taking uh	no
26185	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	my first graduate level courses in D_S_P	no
26186	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	and um when I come back to Norway	no
26187	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I'm gonna continue with the - more of a research project work -	no
26188	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	kind of work.	no
26189	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So this semester I'm starting up with a - with a small project	no
26190	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	through uh Dave Gelbart which I'm taking a course with	no
26191	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I got in touch with him and he told me about this project.	no
26192	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So with the help of uh Dan Ellis	no
26193	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I'm gonna do	no
26194	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	small project associated to this.	no
26195	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	What I'm gonna try to do is uh use - use ech- echo cancellation	no
26196	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	to uh	no
26197	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	to handle the periods where you have overlapping talk.	no
26198	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	To try to do something about that.	no
26199	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So currently I'm um	no
26200	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I'm just reading up on echo cancellation,	no
26201	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	s- looking into the theory behind that	no
26202	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	and then uh	no
26203	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	hopefully I get some results.	no
26204	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So it - it's a - it's a project goes over the course of one semester.	no
26205	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Great.	no
26206	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So I'm just here today to introduce myself.	no
26207	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Tell about I'll be - I'll be working on this.	no
26208	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	And are you staying at Berkeley or is - are you just here a semester?	no
26209	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	This is my second semester and last.	no
26210	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Ah second and last, O_K.	no

26392	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	that - at least that's my current working hypothesis,	no
26393	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Ah.	no
26394	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	that I think what happens is it tries to	no
26395	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Ah.	no
26396	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	When the power went out the other day and I restarted it, it crashed the first time.	no
26397	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	After the power out-	no
26398	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So then there would be no temp files.	no

26400	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	O_K.	no
26401	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Uh, no, it doesn't - it doesn't clear those necessarily, so.	no
26402	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh	no
26403	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Hmm, no connection.	no
26404	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	It's - i- they're	no
26405	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	They're not backed up, but they're not	no
26406	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But that's usually the meeting that	no
26407	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh well.	no
26408	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well this wasn't - Actually, this wasn't a- before	no
26409	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh -	no
26410	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	uh, Robert just wanted to do a little recording, and the power had gone out earlier in the day.	no
26411	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh, right. O_K.	no
26412	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Huh, O_K.	no
26413	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I don't know when would be a good excuse for it, but I just can't wait to be giving a talk t- and - and - and use the example from last week with everybody t- doing the digits at once.	no
26414	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
26415	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	That	no
26416	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I'd love to play somebody that.	no
26417	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	That	no
26418	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	It was quick.	no
26419	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	It	no
26420	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Talk about a good	no
26421	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	You wanted to pe- keep people from listening in, you could like have that playing outside the room. Nobody could listen in.	no
26422	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
26423	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well, I had this idea we could make our whole	no
26424	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
26425	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Everybody give the reports about what they were doing at exactly the same time, yeah.	no
26426	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	And we'll just all leave, and -	no
26427	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	And then we'll - we'll go back later and review the individual channels, right? If you wanna know what -	no
26428	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yep, and then everyone can listen to it	no
26429	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yes.	no
26430	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Actually isn't that what we have been doing?	no
26431	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
26432	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Practically, huh. With all the overlaps.	no
26433	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
26434	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	What are we doing?	no
26435	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I -	yes
26436	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I -	no
26437	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Since I've been gone all week, I didn't send out a reminder for an	no
26438	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, and I'm just -	no
26439	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Do we have anything to talk about or should we just read digits and go?	no
26440	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	What conference?	no
26441	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Uh,	no
26442	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah,	no
26443	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I had one question about - Aren't the U_W folks coming this weekend?	no
26444	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	It's all a blur.	no
26445	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yep.	no
26446	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	No. The	no
26447	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	That is	no
26448	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Sorry, not - not - not the days coming up, but -	no
26449	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	It's like the -	no
26450	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	A week from Saturday.	no
26451	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah,	no
26452	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	No, but that would be a good idea.	no
26453	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	O_K.	no
26454	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Why don't we w-	no
26455	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So - so the deal is that I can,	no
26456	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	um,	no
26457	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	uh, I can be available after,	no
26458	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	uh, like	no
26459	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	ten thirty or something. I don't know how s- how early you wanted to -	no
26460	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	They're not even gonna be here until eleven or so.	no
26461	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh, O_K.	no
26462	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	That's good.	no
26463	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So -	no
26464	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Wait, this is on - on Sunday? Or Saturday?	no
26465	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Cuz they're flying up that day.	no
26466	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Saturday.	no
26467	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Saturday.	no
26468	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	O_K.	no
26469	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well, y-	no
26470	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	S- Saturday.	no
26471	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Mm-hmm.	no
26472	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
26473	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	uh, San	no
26474	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	No, I mean, they're flying up from - from -	no
26475	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Seattle.	no
26476	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	down from	no
26477	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Seattle.	no
26478	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	They're flying	no
26479	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah,	no
26480	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	yeah.	no
26481	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	and they'll end up here. So b- and also Brian	no
26482	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	from, uh, the east	no
26483	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	on that - that morning.	no
26484	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Excellent.	no
26485	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh.	no
26486	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So, i- I - I will be - I mean, he's taking a very early flight and we do have the time work difference running the right way,	no
26487	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	but I	no
26488	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So when we get closer we'll find people's plane schedules, and let everybody know.	no
26489	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Uh,	no
26490	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So. That's	no
26491	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But, uh, yeah maybe an agenda, or at least some things to talk about would be a good idea.	no
26492	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well we can start gathering those - those ideas, but then we - we should firm it up by next - next Thursday's meeting.	yes
26493	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Will we have time to, um,	no
26494	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	to prepare something that we - in the format we were planning for the I_B_M transcribers by then, or - ?	no
26495	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh yeah.	no
26496	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Absolutely.	no
26497	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	O_K.	no
26498	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So have you heard back from Brian about that,	no
26499	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Chuck?	no
26500	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yes, um, he's - I - I'm sorry, I should have forwarded that along.	no
26501	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Uh,	no
26502	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	he talked to them and it was fine - with the beeps they would be - That's easy for them to do.	no
26503	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Great.	no
26504	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	O_K.	no
26505	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So, uh, oh, though Thi- Thilo isn't here, um, but, uh,	no
26506	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I - I	no
26507	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	of	no
26508	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	the channelized	no
26509	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So do we have a meeting that that's been	no
26510	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	He's - he's -	no
26511	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	that we've tightened it up to the point where we can actually	no
26512	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	give it to I_B_M and have them try it out?	no
26513	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	He generated, um, a channel-wise	no
26514	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	depends on whether we're willing to use Robustness?	no
26515	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Mm-hmm.	no
26516	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well for this experiment I think we can use pre- pretty much anything. This experiment of just -	no
26517	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	O_K.	no
26518	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well we had -	no
26519	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	we had	no
26520	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	choice, though. Well,	no
26521	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well we've talked about that as being the next ones we wanted to transcribe.	no
26522	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
26523	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But for the purpose of sending him a sample one to - f- I - I don't think it matte-	no
26524	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	O_K.	no
26525	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, maybe it doesn't matter.	no
26526	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Great. I'll - I'll - I'll, um, get - make that available.	no
26527	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	O_K, and has it	no
26528	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	been corrected?	no
26529	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh, well,	no
26530	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Hand-checked? Cuz that was one of the	no
26531	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	processes we were talking about as well.	no
26532	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right, so we need to run	no
26533	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	That's	no
26534	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Thilo's thing on it, and then we go in and adjust the boundaries.	no
26535	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah that's right. Yeah, we haven't	no
26536	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	And time how long it takes.	no
26537	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
26538	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	O_K. And we probably don't have to do necessarily a whole meeting for that if we just wanna send them a sample to try.	no
26539	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	O_K.	no
26540	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	What would be a good number of minutes?	no
26541	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I don't know, maybe we can figure out how long it'll take	no
26542	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Um,	no
26543	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I don't know, it seems to me w-	no
26544	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	we	no
26545	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yes except that if they had - if there was a choice between	no
26546	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	having fifteen minutes that was fully the way you wanted it, and having a whole meeting that didn't get at what you wanted for them -	no
26547	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	It's just dependent of how much -	no
26548	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I mean I guess if we have to do it again	no
26549	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	but, uh	no
26550	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
26551	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I guess, the only thing I'm not sure about is, um,	no
26552	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	how quickly can the transcribers scan over and fix the boundaries, and -	no
26553	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Mm-hmm.	no
26554	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I mean, is it pretty easy?	no
26555	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I	no
26556	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Cuz they have to at	no
26557	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Can we pipeline it so that say there's, uh, the transcriber gets done with a quarter of the meeting and then we - you run it through this other -	no
26558	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	other stuff?	no
26559	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well the	no
26560	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Uh,	no
26561	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I'm just thinking that	no
26562	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	from a data -	no
26563	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	O_K, so.	no
26564	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	keeping-track-of-the-	no
26565	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	to send them	no
26566	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh, that's right. So the first thing is the automatic thing,	no
26567	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
26568	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	and then it's - then it's - then it's the transcribers tightening stuff up, and then it's I_B_M.	no
26569	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Mm-hmm.	no
26570	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.	no
26571	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
26572	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	O_K, so you might as well ha- run the automatic thing over the entire meeting,	no
26573	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	and then -	no
26574	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	and then, uh,	no
26575	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	you would give I_B_M whatever was	no
26576	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	And have them fix it over the entire meeting	no
26577	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
26578	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well, yeah, but start from the beginning and go to the end, right? So if they were only half way through then that's what you'd give I_B_M.	no
26579	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	O_K.	no
26580	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right?	no
26581	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	As of what point?	no
26582	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I mean.	no
26583	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	The - I guess the question on my mind is do we wait for the transcribers to adjust the marks for the whole meeting before we give	no
26584	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Why wouldn't we s-	no
26585	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Let their -	no
26586	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	we give them -	no
26587	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I mean i- are we trying to get something done by the time Brian comes?	no
26588	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well I - I - I mean, I don't know.	no
26589	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	That was the question.	no
26590	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Though.	no
26591	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So if we - if we	no
26592	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
26593	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	then it seems like giving them	no
26594	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Uh. That - I agree. I agree.	no
26595	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well, I don't think -	no
26596	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I mean, h-	no
26597	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	they - they typically work for what, four hours, something like that?	no
26598	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Hmm, I gue- hmm.	no
26599	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I think the- they	no
26600	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I would	no
26601	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	certainly.	no
26602	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I guess - I mean if - hhh	no
26603	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Or seven or eight.	no
26604	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	We're just doing the individual channels, right?	no
26605	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So it's gonna be, depending on the number of people in the meeting,	no
26606	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I guess there is this issue of, you know, if - if the segmenter thought there was no speech on - on a particular stretch, on a particular channel, and there really	no
26607	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	um,	no
26608	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well -	no
26609	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	then, if it didn't show up in a mixed signal to verify, then it might be overlooked,	no
26610	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	"so, I mean, the question is ""should - should a transcriber listen to the entire thing or can it"	no
26611	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	"g- can it be based on the mixed signal?"" And I th- eh so far as I'm concerned it's fine to base it on the mixed signal at this point, and -"	no
26612	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	That's what it seems to me	no
26613	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	if they	no
26614	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	And that cuts down the time.	no
26615	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	if they	no
26616	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
26617	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But they don't	no
26618	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, that's good. So. Yeah. Good, good, good.	no
26619	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I don't see how that will	no
26620	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	What - what aspect?	no
26621	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So you're talking about tightening up time boundaries? So how do you -	no
26622	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
26623	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So, they	no
26624	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	interface where they have each individual speaker has their own line,	no
26625	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
26626	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	but you're	no
26627	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Should be pretty good, yeah.	no
26628	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Except for	no
26629	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right, so - so you'll have to I -	no
26630	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Uh-huh.	no
26631	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Like that.	no
26632	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But those would be - those would be -	no
26633	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Uh-huh.	no
26634	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Uh-huh!	no
26635	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	"It will - it will miss - Yeah, you have to say ""uh-huh"" more slowly to -"	no
26636	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Sorry.	no
26637	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	to get c- No, I'm s- I'm actually serious. So it	no
26638	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I'll work on that.	no
26639	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I -	no
26640	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, but presumably, most of those they	no
26641	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	should be able to hear from the mixed signal unless they're embedded in the heavil- heavy overlap section when - in which case they'd be listening to the channels anyway.	no
26642	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right, and that's what I'm not sure about.	no
26643	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	That's - that's what I'm - I'm concerned about the part.	no
26644	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, I am too. And I think it's an empirical question.	no
26645	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Can't we - uh couldn't we just have, um,	no
26646	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I don't know, maybe this just doesn't fit with the software, but I guess	no
26647	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	if I didn't know anything about Transcriber and I was gonna	no
26648	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	one channel at a time, with the marks, and let them adju-	no
26649	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh they can -	no
26650	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well, but then they have to do -	no
26651	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	but then they - for this meeting they would have to do seven times real time,	no
26652	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, that's it.	no
26653	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	and it would probably be	no
26654	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
26655	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right? Because they'd have to at least listen to each	no
26656	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But i- but it's very	no
26657	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	And if - Uh-huh.	no
26658	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh, you're talking about visually. I just don't think -	no
26659	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah. w- Well,	no
26660	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	the other problem is the breaths cuz you also see the breaths on the waveform. I've - I've looked at the int- uh, s- I've tried to do that with a single channel,	no
26661	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	and - and you do see all sorts of other stuff besides just the voice.	no
26662	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Uh-huh.	no
26663	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, and I - I think that	no
26664	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	they're going much more on acoustics than they are on visuals.	no
26665	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well	no
26666	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So.	no
26667	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Um, I know for a fact that one of those - sh- she could really well - she could judge what th- what the number was based on the - on the waveform.	no
26668	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, that's actually true. Yeah, you're	no
26669	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	You're absolutely right.	no
26670	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, I found the same thing that when I was scanning through the wave form	no
26671	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I could	no
26672	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, she could tell which one was	no
26673	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Um, maybe.	no
26674	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So I don't - I'm - I'm now entirely confused about what they do. So, they're - they're looking at	no
26675	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But -	no
26676	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	a mixed signal, or they're looking - what - what are they looking at visually?	no
26677	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well, they have a choice. They could choose	no
26678	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I've tried lookin- but usually they look at the mixed.	no
26679	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But I've - I've	no
26680	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	in order to judge when it - when it was speech and when it wasn't, but the problem is then you have breaths which - which show up on the signal.	no
26681	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh.	no
26682	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But the procedure that you're imagining, I mean, people vary from this, is that they have the mixed signal wave form in front of them,	no
26683	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yes.	no
26684	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yes.	no
26685	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	and they have multiple, uh, well, let's see, there isn't -	no
26686	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	we don't have transcription yet.	no
26687	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So - but there's	no
26688	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
26689	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yes.	no
26690	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh, they show up on the separate ribbons. So you have a separate ribbon for each channel,	no
26691	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	N-	no
26692	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	the t-	no
26693	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
26694	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	There're separate ribbons.	no
26695	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	and - and i- i- it'll be - because it's being segmented as channel at a time with his - with Thilo's new procedure, then	no
26696	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	you don't have the correspondence of the times across the bins - uh across the ribbons uh you could have -	no
26697	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	And is there a line moving across the waveform as it goes? O_K, so	no
26698	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yes.	no
26699	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yes.	no
26700	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	The way you're imaging is they kind of play it, and they see oh this happened, then this happened, then - and if it's about right, they just sort of let it slide,	no
26701	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
26702	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
26703	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
26704	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	and if it - if it - there's a question on something, they stop and maybe look at the individual wave form.	no
26705	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
26706	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	"Oh, well not - not ""look""."	no
26707	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well, they	no
26708	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	at this point.	no
26709	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	They would just listen.	no
26710	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	They - they might look at it, right?	no
26711	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well, the	no
26712	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	the	no
26713	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	doesn't really allow you to switch visuals.	no
26714	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Not very quickly. You	no
26715	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	The	no
26716	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	the Tcl-T_K interface with	no
26717	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	the	no
26718	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	That's it.	no
26719	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Uh-huh.	no
26720	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	And so when I tried - that -	no
26721	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	that was the first thing I tried when I first started it,	no
26722	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh, oh.	no
26723	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	right?	no
26724	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	You can - you can switch	no
26725	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So you have to - It takes, I don't know, three, four minutes to - Well, I mean, it takes - it takes long enough -	no
26726	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, it's very slow	no
26727	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	It takes long enough cuz it has to reload the I - I don't know exactly what it's doing frankly cuz - but it t- it takes long enough that it's just not a practical alternative.	no
26728	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	to do that.	no
26729	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	That w-	no
26730	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well it -	no
26731	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	it	no
26732	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	does some sort of	no
26733	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But you can	no
26734	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
26735	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	change the resolution or	no
26736	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh, really?	no
26737	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So.	no
26738	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Huh!	no
26739	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Now you	no
26740	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	and then look between the windows. Maybe	no
26741	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I mean, we - we could	no
26742	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	What if you	no
26743	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I mean, so - so we could	no
26744	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
26745	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	and it loads faster,	no
26746	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	certainly.	no
26747	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	What if you were to	no
26748	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	or initially -	no
26749	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	like doesn't -	no
26750	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well that's what I tried originally. So I - I actually before,	no
26751	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	uh,	no
26752	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Dave Gelbart did this, I	no
26753	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	a	no
26754	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Mm-hmm.	no
26755	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	but the	no
26756	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh, O_K.	no
26757	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So you just scroll a	no
26758	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	"""kur-chunk!"""	no
26759	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Mm-hmm.	no
26760	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	And so it just was not doable with the current interface.	no
26761	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	You know, I	no
26762	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	fire up a Transcriber interface for, y- you know, in different windows, multiple ones, one for each channel. And it's sort of a - a hack but I mean it would be one way of	no
26763	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I think that if we	no
26764	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	we need -	no
26765	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	that they need to see the visuals, we need to change the interface so that they can do that.	no
26766	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah. Yeah.	no
26767	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	That's actually what I thought of, loading the chopped	no
26768	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	An-	no
26769	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So -	no
26770	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	you know, that - that would make it faster -	no
26771	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Hmm.	no
26772	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But isn't -	no
26773	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	The chopped up waveforms.	no
26774	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So.	no
26775	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	The problem is if - if anything's cut off, you can't expand it from the chopped up -	no
26776	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right, but if you	no
26777	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	And wouldn't that be the	no
26778	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	a- at some point -	no
26779	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	No, I mean the individual channels that were chopped up that - it'd be nice to be able to go back and forth between	no
26780	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	short segments. Cuz you don't really nee- like	no
26781	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Mm-hmm.	no
26782	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	nine tenths of the time you're throwing most of them out, but what you need are tho- that particular channel, or that particular location, and,	no
26783	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
26784	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	um,	no
26785	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
26786	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	might be nice, cuz we save those out already,	no
26787	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	um,	no
26788	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	to be able to do that. But it won't work for I_B_M of course, it only works here cuz they're not saving out the individual	no
26789	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	channels.	no
26790	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well, I - I	no
26791	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
26792	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	O_K.	no
26793	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	then when they get into overlaps, just have	no
26794	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
26795	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, hopefully, I mean -	no
26796	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	The	no
26797	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	because it is volume equalized. So I think they should be able to hear.	no
26798	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	The only problem is - is,	no
26799	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	you know, counting how many and if they're really	no
26800	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I don't know that you can locate them very well from the mixed signal,	no
26801	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right but -	no
26802	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	but once - once you know that they	no
26803	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	but you would know that they were there, and then you would switch. Right. And then you would switch into the other -	no
26804	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	to the close talking, so.	no
26805	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But right now, to do this limitation, the switching is going to be switching of the audio? Is what she's saying.	no
26806	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
26807	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
26808	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So -	no
26809	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right, so - so	no
26810	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	did Dave -	no
26811	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	so they're using their ears to do these markings anyway.	no
26812	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yes. Yes.	no
26813	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Did Dave do that change where you can actually just click rather than having to go up to the menu	no
26814	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
26815	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Click -	no
26816	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	to listen to the individual channels?	no
26817	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Um,	no
26818	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I had suggested it before. I just don't know whether he did it or not.	no
26819	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I'm not sure what - click what - click on the ribbon? Yeah, you can get that - oh, oh, get - you can get the, uh - you can get it to switch audio?	no
26820	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
26821	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
26822	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Uh, not last I tried, but, um, maybe he's changed it again.	no
26823	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	We should get him to do that	no
26824	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	because, uh, I think that would be	no
26825	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I disagree.	no
26826	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	There's a reason I disagree, and that is that, uh, you - it's very good to have a dissociation between the visual and the audio. There're times when	no
26827	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I wanna hear the mixed signal, bu- but I want to transcribe on the single channel. So right now -	no
26828	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Then maybe just buttons down at the bottom	no
26829	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Maybe, I just don't - I don't see that it's a -	no
26830	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	next to it. Just something so that it's not in the menu option so that you can do it much faster.	no
26831	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well, I mean, that's the i- I - I think that might be a personal style thing. I find it really convenient the way - the way it's set up right now.	no
26832	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well	no
26833	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	it just seems to me that if you wanna quickly -	no
26834	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	"""well was that Jane, no, was that Chuck, no, was that Morgan"", right"	no
26835	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	and each time, go up to the menu, select it, listen to that channel then click below, and then go back to the menu, select the next one, and then click below.	no
26836	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	That's fine.	no
26837	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, it's true.	no
26838	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So you can definitely streamline that with the i- with the interface.	no
26839	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, it could be faster, but, you know, I mean, th- in the ideal world -	no
26840	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	What?	no
26841	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	O_K.	no
26842	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So, um,	no
26843	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Done with that?	no
26844	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	working	no
26845	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Hhh!	no
26846	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So, I'm gonna	no
26847	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	but, uh,	no
26848	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	we'll just have to see. So actually I wanna get together with both Andreas and, uh,	no
26849	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	uh,	no
26850	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Stephane	no
26851	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	with their respective systems.	no
26852	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
26853	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah there was that - we- that's right, we had that one conversation about, uh,	no
26854	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	what - what - what did it mean for, uh, one of those speakers to be pathological, was it a -	no
26855	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right,	no
26856	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	and I haven't had s- chance to sit down and listen. I was going to do that this afternoon.	no
26857	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh, I haven't - I haven't listened to them	no
26858	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	but there	no
26859	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	unless our -	no
26860	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well,	no
26861	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Whereas	no
26862	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I	no
26863	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	the	no
26864	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	or,	no
26865	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	uh, fifteen to twenty percent average?	no
26866	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But then he ran it just on the	no
26867	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	and got about five or	no
26868	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So that - that means to me that	no
26869	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	you know, we - th- that	no
26870	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So I'll -	no
26871	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
26872	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
26873	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Did you run the - Andreas - the r- S_R_I recognizer on the digits?	no
26874	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
26875	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh, I thought he had sent that around to	no
26876	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	No, I d- I didn't.	no
26877	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh.	no
26878	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Since I considered those preliminary, I didn't.	no
26879	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But, yeah, if you take -	no
26880	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I- it wasn't -	no
26881	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	It was bimodal.	no
26882	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So if you - Yeah, it's actually, um, it - uh - it was trimodal, actually -	no
26883	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh, was it trimodal, O_K.	no
26884	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah. There's zero, a little bit, and a lot.	no
26885	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	trimodal, so	no
26886	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	there were -	no
26887	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	t-	no
26888	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	there was -	no
26889	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	there was one h- one bump at ze- around zero,	no
26890	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	which were the native speakers,	no
26891	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
26892	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
26893	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	the non-pathological native speakers.	no
26894	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Zero percent error?	no
26895	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Y- yeah.	no
26896	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Then there was another bump at, um,	no
26897	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	oh, like fifteen or something.	no
26898	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh was it fifteen?	no
26899	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	This is error you're talking about? O_K.	no
26900	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	whe-	no
26901	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
26902	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah. Those were the non-natives.	no
26903	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
26904	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	And then there was another distinct bump at,	no
26905	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	like, a hundred,	no
26906	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh, wow!	no
26907	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	which must have been some problem. I can't imagine that -	no
26908	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh, O_K.	no
26909	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	What is patho- what do you mean by pathological? I'm sorry, I don't -	no
26910	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Just - just something	no
26911	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	In the recording	no
26912	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh.	no
26913	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	A	no
26914	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh, O_K. I see.	no
26915	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	And there was this	no
26916	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	uh, six out of the eight channels were	no
26917	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	like - had a hundred percent error.	no
26918	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Which	no
26919	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	th-	no
26920	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	the recording	no
26921	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
26922	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	interface crashed, or there was a short -	no
26923	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	you know, someone was jiggling with a cord or,	no
26924	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But -	no
26925	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	uh, I extracted it incorrectly, it was labeled - it was transcribed incorrectly, something	no
26926	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But -	no
26927	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Mm-hmm.	no
26928	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	really bad happened, and I just haven't listened to it yet to find out what it was.	no
26929	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	O_K.	no
26930	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So, if I excluded the	no
26931	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	pathological ones,	no
26932	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	by definition, those that had like over ninety-five percent	no
26933	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	error rate,	no
26934	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	and the	no
26935	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh. Oh.	no
26936	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Hmm!	no
26937	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	which -	no
26938	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	which seemed reasonable given that,	no
26939	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	you know, the models weren't tuned for -	no
26940	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
26941	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	for it. And the grammar wasn't tuned either. It was just a	no
26942	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	And it didn't matter whether it was the lapel or whether it was the -	no
26943	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I haven't split it up that way,	no
26944	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	but it would be -	no
26945	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But there's no overlap during the digit readings, so it shouldn't really matter.	no
26946	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
26947	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
26948	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
26949	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So it should -	no
26950	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	No, but there's a little difference, and we haven't looked at it for digits, right? And so,	no
26951	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	There's a	no
26952	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, so I was curious about that.	no
26953	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	cuz - because what he was - what I was saying when I looked at those things is it - it - I was almost gonna call it quadrimodal because	no
26954	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Mm-hmm.	no
26955	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	They just plain got it all right.	no
26956	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
26957	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	And then there - and then there was another bunch that were couple percent or something.	no
26958	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But if you p- if you actually	no
26959	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
26960	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	uh, you know, it - it was -	no
26961	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	A normal.	no
26962	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	there were -	no
26963	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	the others were sort of decaying from there.	no
26964	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, yeah.	no
26965	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	And then there was the bump for the	no
26966	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I see. I see.	no
26967	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, cuz some of our non-natives are pretty non-native.	no
26968	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	yes
26969	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
26970	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	You - did you have, uh, something in the report about, uh, - about, uh, for- f- uh, forced alignment? Have you - have you started on that?	no
26971	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh, well, yeah, so I've been struggling with the forced alignments. Um.	no
26972	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So the scheme that I	no
26973	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	drew on the board last time where we tried to, um	no
26974	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	allow	no
26975	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	s-	no
26976	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	speech from other	no
26977	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	speakers,	no
26978	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	um,	no
26979	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So,	no
26980	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	um,	no
26981	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Hmm.	no
26982	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	and the -	no
26983	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I haven't done - I mean, the only	no
26984	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	way to	no
26985	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	load these into	no
26986	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	you know, plus the alignments, and s-	no
26987	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	And it looks - And so I looked at	no
26988	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	all of the	no
26989	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	utterances from	no
26990	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	one conversation,	no
26991	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I don't know which -	no
26992	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	where	no
26993	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	and Morgan was sitting next to you and we can hear everything Morgan says.	no
26994	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Hmm.	no
26995	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But -	no
26996	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	and - and some of what you - I mean, you	no
26997	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	appear quite a bit in that cross-talk.	no
26998	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So,	no
26999	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I actually	no
27000	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	went through	no
27001	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	um, in - in	no
27002	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	sort of did a crude check, and	no
27003	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	more often than not, it - it gets it wrong. So there's either the beginning,	no
27004	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	where th- you, um,	no
27005	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	you know, Chuck talks somewhere into the segment,	no
27006	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	but	no
27007	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	the first,	no
27008	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	um,	no
27009	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	"""I"" but it's very"	no
27010	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	that's just aligned	no
27011	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	to the beginning of someone else's speech, uh in that segment, which is cross-talk. So,	no
27012	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	um,	no
27013	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I'm still tinkering with it, but	no
27014	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	it might well be that we can't get clean alignments out of this - out of those, uh,	no
27015	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	channels, so.	no
27016	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Unless maybe we do this, uh, um, cancellation business.	no
27017	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right, but that's - I mean, that was our plan, but it's clear from Dan that this is not something you can do in a short amount of time.	no
27018	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, right.	no
27019	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh, the short amount of time thing, right.	yes
27020	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh, the short amount of time thing, right.	no
27021	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So - so	no
27022	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
27023	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	you know, it's a very crude measure of overlap. It's not really something you could scientifically say is overlap, it's just whether or not the,	no
27024	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	um,	no
27025	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	c- High correlation.	no
27026	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	the segments that were all synchronized, whether there was some overlap somewhere.	no
27027	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	And, you know, that pointed out some differences, so he thought well if we can	no
27028	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	do something quick and dirty because Dan said the cross-cancellation, it's not straight-forward. If it were straight-forward then we would try it, but - so, it's sort of	no
27029	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	good to hear that it was not straight-forward, thinking if we can get decent forced alignments,	no
27030	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	then at least we can do sort of a overall report of	no
27031	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	what happens with actual overlap	no
27032	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	in time, but,	no
27033	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	um -	no
27034	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I didn't think that his message said it wasn't straight-	no
27035	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well if we'd just -	no
27036	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well	no
27037	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Um-hmm.	no
27038	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I thought he's just saying you have to look over a longer	no
27039	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	and the - but there are some issues of this timing, um, in the recordings and -	no
27040	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
27041	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right. So you just have to look over longer	no
27042	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well. are you talking about the fact that the recording software doesn't do time-synchronous? Is that what you're referring to?	no
27043	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	That seems to me you can do that over the entire file and get a	no
27044	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I don't thi-	no
27045	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I d-	no
27046	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I don't think	no
27047	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I - yeah, that was sort of a side issue.	no
27048	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	to - you	no
27049	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	you	no
27050	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	And it's dynamic, so I guess it was more dynamic than some simple models	no
27051	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	would be able t- to - so - so there are some things available, and I don't know too much about this area where	no
27052	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	if people aren't moving around much than you could apply them, and it should work pretty well if you took care of this recording time difference.	no
27053	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right, which should be pretty straight forward.	no
27054	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Which a- at least is well defined, and	no
27055	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
27056	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	um, but then if you add the dynamic aspect of adapting distances, then it wasn't -	no
27057	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I guess it just wasn't something that he could	no
27058	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So - um, so I don't know what we can do if anything, that's sort of worth,	no
27059	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	you know, a Eurospeech paper at this point.	no
27060	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well, Andreas, how well did it work on the non-lapel stuff?	no
27061	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah. That's what I was gonna say. C-	no
27062	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I haven't	no
27063	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Mmm.	no
27064	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Um, we would	no
27065	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	to	no
27066	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	you know, the be- at	no
27067	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Um,	no
27068	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	and,	no
27069	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	you know, then with the	no
27070	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	comparison of your -	no
27071	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	of your forced alignments.	no
27072	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh,	no
27073	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Because - really the - the - at least in terms of how we were gonna	no
27074	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Mm-hmm.	no
27075	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	to get an ideal - an idea, uh, for each channel about the start and end boundaries. We don't really care about like intermediate word boundaries, so -	no
27076	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	No, that's how I've been	no
27077	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
27078	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
27079	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
27080	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	you	no
27081	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	uh,	no
27082	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right, exactly. So that's why I was wondering if it -	no
27083	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I mean, maybe if it doesn't work for lapel stuff, we can just not use that and -	no
27084	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
27085	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I haven't -	no
27086	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I ha- just haven't had the time to, um,	no
27087	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	do the same procedure on one of the -	no
27088	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	so I would need a k- I would need a channel that has	no
27089	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	a speaker whose -	no
27090	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	who has a	no
27091	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	you know, is a	no
27092	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	non-lapel mike.	no
27093	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	And, um,	no
27094	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	where preferably, also there's someone sitting	no
27095	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	who talks a lot.	no
27096	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Hmm!	no
27097	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So,	no
27098	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I - maybe someone can help me find a good candidate and then I would	no
27099	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	be willing to	no
27100	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	We c- you know what? Maybe the best way to find that would be to look through	no
27101	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	you know, hand-	no
27102	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Cuz you can see the seat numbers, and then you can see what type of	no
27103	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	And so we just look for, you know, somebody sitting next to	no
27104	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	at one of the meetings -	no
27105	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Actually y- we can tell from the data that we have, um, yeah, there's a way to tell. It might not be a single person who's always overlapping that person but any number of people, and,	no
27106	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	From the insertions, maybe?	no
27107	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	fr-	no
27108	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	fr- from the -	no
27109	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
27110	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	um, if you align the two	no
27111	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	hypothesis files across the channels, you know, just word alignment, you'd be able to find that.	no
27112	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So -	no
27113	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	so I guess that's sort of a last -	no
27114	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	ther- there're sort of a few things we could do. One is just do like non-lapels if we can get good enough alignments. Another one was to try to get -	no
27115	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	somehow align Thilo's energy segmentations with	no
27116	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	what we have. But then you have the problem of not knowing where the words are because these meetings were done before that segmentation. But maybe there's something that could be done.	no
27117	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	What - what is - why do you need the, um,	no
27118	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	the forced alignment for the H_L_T - I mean for the Eurospeech paper?	no
27119	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well,	no
27120	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I guess I - I wanted to just do something not on	no
27121	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	recognition experiments because that's ju- way too early, but to be able to report,	no
27122	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	you know, actual numbers. Like if we - if we had	no
27123	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	hand-transcribed pe- good alignments or hand-checked alignments, then we could do this paper. It's not that we need it to be automatic.	no
27124	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But without knowing where the real words are, in time -	no
27125	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So it was to get - it was to get more data and better - to - to squeeze the boundaries in.	no
27126	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	To - to know what an overlap really - if it's really an overlap, or if it's just a -	no
27127	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Ah, O_K. Yeah.	no
27128	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	a - a segment correlated with an overlap, and I guess that's the difference to me between like a real paper and a sort of, promissory paper.	no
27129	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So,	no
27130	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	um, if we d-	no
27131	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	it might be possible to take Thilo's output	no
27132	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	and like if you have, um,	no
27133	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	like right now these meetings are all,	no
27134	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Ugh!	no
27135	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I forgot the digital camera	no
27136	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	um,	no
27137	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	you know, they're time-aligned, so if these are two different channels	no
27138	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	and somebody's talking here and somebody else is talking here, just that word,	no
27139	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Mm-hmm.	no
27140	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	if Thilo can tell us that there're boundaries here, we should be able to figure that out because the only thing transcribed in this channel is this word.	no
27141	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But, um, you know, if there are things -	no
27142	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Two words.	no
27143	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, if you have two and they're at the edges, it's like here and here, and there's speech here, then it doesn't really help you, so, um -	no
27144	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Thilo's won't put down two separate marks in that case -	no
27145	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well it w- it would, but, um, we don't know exactly where the words are because the transcriber gave us two words in this time bin and we don't really know,	no
27146	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I mean, yeah it's -	no
27147	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well it's a merging problem. If you had a - if you had a s- if you had a script which would - I've	no
27148	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I mean, if you have any ideas.	no
27149	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	um, the,	no
27150	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I mean, I - I - in principle I could imagine writing a script which would	no
27151	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well maybe -	no
27152	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Maybe that will get enough of the cases to be useful.	no
27153	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right. I mean, that - that would be really helpful. That was sort of another possibility.	no
27154	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	You know s- cuz it seemed like	no
27155	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	sorts, or at least a single phrase	no
27156	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Mmm.	no
27157	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	"Well they - they can be stretched. I wouldn't make that generalization cuz sometimes people will say, ""And then I"" and there's a long pause"	no
27158	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	in most of the bins.	no
27159	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
27160	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	and finish the sentence and - and sometimes it looks coherent and - and the - I mean it's - it's not a simple problem.	no
27161	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But it's really - And then it's coupled with the problem that sometimes, you know, with - with a fricative you might get the beginning of the word cut off and so it's coupled with the problem that Thilo's isn't	no
27162	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	perfect either. I mean, we've i- th- it's like you have a merging problem plus - so merging plus this problem of, uh, not -	no
27163	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
27164	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Hmm!	no
27165	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	y- i- i- if the speech-nonspeech were perfect to begin with, the detector, that would already be an improvement, but that's impossible, you know, i- that's too much to ask.	no
27166	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
27167	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yes.	no
27168	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	And so i-	no
27169	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I think that there always - th- there would have to be some hand-tweaking, but it's	no
27170	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	in terms of not him doing it, but we - we discussed some of the parameters of that and how hard it would be to - in principle - to write something that would do that.	no
27171	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I mean, I guess in the future it won't be as much as an issue if	no
27172	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	transcribers are using the tightened boundaries to start with, then we have a	no
27173	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	good idea of where the forced alignment is constrained to. So I'm no- I don't know if this-	no
27174	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well, it's just, you know, a matter of we had the revolution - we had the revolution of improved, uh, interface, um, one month too late, but it's like,	no
27175	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh.	no
27176	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Tools.	no
27177	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh it's - it's a - yeah.	no
27178	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	you know, it's wonderful to have the revolution,	no
27179	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right. And we'll just have to	no
27180	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, that's right. That's right.	no
27181	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So - so whether the corrections take too much time. I was just	no
27182	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
27183	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	that might be	no
27184	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Good point.	no
27185	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But he - he also can adjust this minimum time duration constraint and then what you get is	no
27186	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
27187	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Spurious.	no
27188	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	noises mostly, but that might be O_K, an-	no
27189	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	It might be easier to delete something that's	no
27190	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right. And you can also see in the waveform - exac- yeah.	no
27191	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	If you can feel confident that what the - yeah, that there's actually something - that you're not gonna miss something, yeah.	no
27192	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
27193	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah. Cuz then - then you just delete it, and you don't have to pick a time.	no
27194	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I think it's -	no
27195	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well the problem is I - you know - I - I - it's a - it's a really good question, and I really find it a pain in the neck to delete things because you have to get the mouse up there	no
27196	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	on the t- on the text line and i- and otherwise you just use an arrow to get down - I mean, i- it depends on how lar-	no
27197	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	extra things that would make it	no
27198	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	one of them harder than the other, or - or vice versa. It's not a simple question. But, you know, I mean, in principle, like, you know, if one of them is easier then to bias it towards whichever one's easier.	no
27199	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, I guess the semantics aren't clear when you delete a segment, right? Because you would say - You would have to determine what the surroundings were.	no
27200	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	You could just say it's a noise, though, and write, you know, a post-processor will just -	no
27201	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	all you have to do is just -	no
27202	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	If it's really a noise.	no
27203	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	"or just say it's - just put ""X_,"" you know, like ""not speech"" or something, and then you can get -"	no
27204	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I think it's easier to add than delete, frankly, because you have to, uh, maneuver around on the - on	no
27205	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, or-	no
27206	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	To add or to delete?	no
27207	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	To delete.	no
27208	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	O_K.	no
27209	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Anyways, so I - I guess -	no
27210	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	That - Maybe that's an interface issue that might be addressable. But I think it's the semantics that are - that are	no
27211	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	It's possible.	no
27212	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	and then you have a little segment here.	no
27213	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well, is that part of the speech? Is it part of the nonspeech?	no
27214	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I mean, w- what do you embed it in?	no
27215	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	There's something nice, though, about keeping,	no
27216	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	and this is probably another discussion, keeping the stuff that Thilo's detector detected as possible speech and just marking it as not speech than	no
27217	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	deleting it. Because then when you align it, then the alignment can - you can put a reject model or whatever, and you're consistent with th- the automatic system, whereas if you delete it -	no
27218	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	"Oh, I see. So then they could just like put - Oh that's what you meant by just put an ""X_"" there."	no
27219	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Uh,	no
27220	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	"So - so all they - So that all they would have to do is put like an ""X_"" there."	no
27221	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, or some, you know, dummy reject mod-	no
27222	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So blank for -	no
27223	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	"blank for silence, ""S_"" for speech, ""X_"" for"	no
27224	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	whatever, yeah. That's actually a better way to do it cuz the a- the forced alignment will probably be more consistent than -	no
27225	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	something else.	no
27226	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well, like, I think there's a complication which is that - that you can have speech and noise in s-	no
27227	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I mean if it's just as easy, but -	no
27228	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	uh, you know, on the same channel, the same	no
27229	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	uh, I mean, there're these fuzzy hybrid cases,	no
27230	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	and then the problem with the boundaries that have to be shifted around.	no
27231	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	It's not a simple - not a simple problem.	no
27232	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Anyway, quick question, though, at a high level do people think,	no
27233	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	let's just say that we're moving to this new era of like using the, um, pre-segmented t- you know, non-synchronous	no
27234	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	conversations, does it make sense to try to take what we have now, which are the ones that, you know, we have recognition on which are synchronous and not time-tightened, and try to	no
27235	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	get something out of those for sort of purposes of illustrating the structure and the nature of the meetings, or is it better to just,	no
27236	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	you know, forget that and tr- I mean, it's -	no
27237	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	And my	no
27238	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right. That was everybody's hope.	no
27239	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	And maybe we can for the non-lapel, but is it worth - if we can't then we can fake it even if we're - we report, you know, we're wrong twenty percent of the time or ten percent of the time.	no
27240	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But if we can't, then maybe we just have to -	no
27241	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Uh - uh, that's a good question actually.	no
27242	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I mean cuz for the	no
27243	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Actually that's a good question because we'd have to completely redo those meetings, and we have like ten of them now.	no
27244	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	We wouldn't have to re-	no
27245	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well, and	no
27246	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	No, you're right, actually -	no
27247	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	When -	no
27248	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	when Brian Kingsbury comes.	no
27249	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh,	no
27250	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, good question. Well,	no
27251	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Uh, no, that's a good point, though, because for feature extraction like for prosody or something, I mean, the meetings we have now, it's a good chunk of data -	no
27252	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yep.	no
27253	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	we need to get a decent f- O_K.	no
27254	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So we should at least try it even if we can't, right?	no
27255	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	That's what	no
27256	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	forced alignment has been on the - on the table as a way of cleaning	no
27257	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	On the table, right?	no
27258	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	There's -	no
27259	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
27260	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I mean, we might be able, at the very worst, we can get transcribers to correct the cases where - I mean, you sort of have a good estimate where these places are because the recognition's so poor.	no
27261	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right? And so you're -	no
27262	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, we were	no
27263	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I agree. I agree.	no
27264	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
27265	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So we need some way to push these first chunk of meetings into a state where we get good alignments.	no
27266	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Absolutely.	no
27267	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I'm	no
27268	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	improve things by, um,	no
27269	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	by using,	no
27270	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	um,	no
27271	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	acoustic adaptation.	no
27272	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Um,	no
27273	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	the -	no
27274	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right now I'm using	no
27275	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	the unadapted	no
27276	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	models for the	no
27277	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	forced alignments,	no
27278	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	and it's	no
27279	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	considerably better results if you, uh, manage to	no
27280	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	adapt the,	no
27281	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	uh,	no
27282	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	to - to all the	no
27283	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Um,	no
27284	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	so	no
27285	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Could you - could you at the same time	no
27286	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	adapt the reject model to	no
27287	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	the speech from all the other channels?	no
27288	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	That's what he just said.	no
27289	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	That's what he was saying.	no
27290	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
27291	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh, not just the speech from that - of the other people from	no
27292	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
27293	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
27294	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	but the speech from the a- actual	no
27295	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh, oh, I see. Um,	no
27296	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I don't think so. I don't think that would work, right? Because you'd - A lot of it's dominated by	no
27297	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh.	no
27298	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	No, it -	no
27299	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	th-	no
27300	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Exactly.	no
27301	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So you want to u-	no
27302	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But what you do wanna do is take the, even if it's klugey, take the segments - the synchronous segments, the ones from the H_L_T paper, where only that speaker was talking. Use those for adaptation, cuz if you -	no
27303	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	if you use everything, then you get all the cross-talk in the adaptation, and it's just sort of blurred. And that we know, I mean, we have that. And it's about	no
27304	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	That's a good point.	no
27305	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yep.	no
27306	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	If you -	no
27307	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
27308	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	roughly two-thirds, I mean, very roughly averaged. That's not completely negligible. Like a third of it is bad for adaptation or so.	no
27309	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Mm-hmm.	no
27310	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Cool. I thought it was higher than that, that's pr-	no
27311	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	It really - it depends a lot. This is just sort of an overall -	no
27312	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So.	no
27313	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well I know what we're	no
27314	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
27315	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	That - I don't wanna do	no
27316	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, I'm doing that for AVIOS.	no
27317	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	yes
27318	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, I'm doing that for AVIOS.	no
27319	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But I think we're - oh, Morgan's talk went very well, I think. I think Morgan's talk went very well it woke - you know, it was really a well presented - and got people laughing -	no
27320	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Bleep.	no
27321	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	"Uh, ""bleep"". Yeah,"	no
27322	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Excellent.	no
27323	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Some good jokes in it?	no
27324	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
27325	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Especially the batteried meter popping up, that was hilarious. Right when you were talking about that.	no
27326	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
27327	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	You know, that wa- that was the battery meter saying that it was fully charged, yeah.	no
27328	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	It's full. Yeah.	no
27329	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	"You said, ""Speaking about energy"", or"	no
27330	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But that was funny.	no
27331	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	He - he - he was onto the bullet points about talking about	no
27332	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
27333	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Po- low power and -	no
27334	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	"the - you know - the little hand-held, and trying to get lower power and so on, and Microsoft pops up a little window saying ""Your batteries are now fully charged."""	no
27335	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	That's great.	no
27336	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	"I'm thinking about scripting that for my talk, you know, put - put a little script in there to say ""Your batteries are low"" right when I'm saying that."	no
27337	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
27338	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah. No I mean, i- in - in your case, I mean, you were joking about it, but, I mean, your case	no
27339	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	the fact that your talking about similar things at a couple of conferences, it's not -	no
27340	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	these are conferences that have d- really different emphases. Whereas H_L_T and - and Eurospeech, pretty -	no
27341	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Are too close, yeah.	no
27342	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	pretty - pretty similar, so I - I - I can't see really	no
27343	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	just putting in the same thing, but -	no
27344	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	No, I d- I don't think that paper is really -	no
27345	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	the H_L_T paper is really more of a introduction-to-the-project paper, and, um -	no
27346	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
27347	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, for Eurospeech we want some results	no
27348	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well, yeah, it - it's - probably wouldn't make sense, but -	no
27349	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Or some - or some - I mean,	no
27350	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I would see Eurospeech - if we have some Eurospeech papers, these will be paper p- p- uh, submissions. These will be things that are particular things,	no
27351	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	aspects of it that we're looking at, rather than, you know, attempt at a global paper about it.	no
27352	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Detail, yeah. Overall.	no
27353	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right, right.	no
27354	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I	no
27355	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh.	no
27356	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	very accurate. I men- I mentioned the link. I sent - You know that one?	no
27357	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh, so -	no
27358	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	The - which one? I'm sorry.	no
27359	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Um, I'm trying to remember - I don't remember the number off hand. It's one of the N_S_A's. I sent email before the conference, before last week.	no
27360	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Those are all -	no
27361	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh, O_K.	no
27362	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	That might - might have been the one - one of the ones that we did.	no
27363	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Bef- What I mean is Wednesday, Thursday.	no
27364	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Mm-hmm.	no
27365	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I'm sure that that one's accurate, I've been through it	no
27366	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	O_K.	no
27367	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So that might actually be useful but they're all non-native speakers.	no
27368	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So we could compare before and	no
27369	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah. Yeah, that's what I was gonna say. The problem with those, they're all German. So.	no
27370	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, that's the problem with the N_S_A speakers.	no
27371	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	oh,	no
27372	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	And e- and e- and	no
27373	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Darn!	no
27374	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
27375	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I corrected it for a number of the words. I'm sure that, um, they're - they're accurate now.	no
27376	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Uh, actually I have to -	no
27377	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I mean, this is tough for a language model probably -	no
27378	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	to go.	no
27379	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
27380	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	but - but that might be useful just for	no
27381	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well.	no
27382	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	O_K, Andreas is leaving - leaving the building.	no
27383	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	speech.	no
27384	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Mm-hmm.	no
27385	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
27386	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	See ya.	no
27387	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	See ya.	yes
27388	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Um, oh, before you l- go -	no
27389	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I don't think we'll go much longer.	no
27390	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I guess it's alright for you to talk a little without the mike - I noticed you adjusting the mike a lot, did it not fit you well?	no
27391	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh.	no
27392	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well I won- I noticed when you turned your head, it would - it would tilt.	no
27393	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Maybe it wasn't just tightened enough, or -	no
27394	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Maybe the - yeah, the s- thing that you have tightened	no
27395	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Actually if - if you have a larger head, that mike's gotta go farther away which means the - the balance is gonna make it wanna tip down.	no
27396	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	O_K.	no
27397	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Anyway.	no
27398	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah. O_K, see ya.	no
27399	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Cuz, I'm just thinking, you know, we were - we're - we've been	no
27400	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
27401	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	uh, for a while, and if these aren't -	no
27402	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I think it's com- This is the first time I've worn this, I find it very comfortable.	no
27403	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I find it very comfortable too, but, uh, it looked like Andreas was having problems, and I think Morgan was saying it -	no
27404	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well, but I had it on - I had it on this morning and it was fine.	no
27405	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Can I see that?	no
27406	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh, oh you did wear it this morning? O_K, it's	no
27407	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
27408	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I - yeah, I don't want it on, I just -	no
27409	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I just want to, um,	no
27410	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	say what I think is a problem with this.	no
27411	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	If you are wearing this	no
27412	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	over your ears	no
27413	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	and you've got it all the way out here,	no
27414	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	then the balance is gonna want to pull it	no
27415	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
27416	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
27417	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	It's more balanced.	no
27418	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	right? Yeah. Then it - then it falls back this way so it's -	no
27419	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh!	no
27420	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well wh- what it's supposed to do is the backstrap is supposed to be under your crown, and so that should be -	no
27421	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	if it's right against your head there, which is what it's supposed to be, that balances it	no
27422	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Ah.	no
27423	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	so it doesn't slide up. Yep, right - right below - if you feel the back of your head, you feel a little lump,	no
27424	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So	no
27425	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	under that little protuberance.	no
27426	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	um, and so it's supposed to be right under that.	no
27427	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
27428	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So it's really supposed to go more like	no
27429	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yes, exactly.	no
27430	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	That - that - that tilts, right?	no
27431	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	In lots and lots of different ways.	no
27432	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So I'm not saying anything about bias towards small headsize, but	no
27433	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	About heads?	no
27434	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	does seem, uh -	no
27435	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well, wonder if it's - if - if he was wearing it over his hair instead of under his hair.	no
27436	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well, we should -	no
27437	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I think probably it was -	no
27438	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	We shou- we should work on compressing the heads, and -	no
27439	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
27440	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	The	no
27441	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	which is not really what we want.	no
27442	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah	no
27443	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
27444	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	What did you say?	no
27445	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	wh-	no
27446	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	A little, um,	no
27447	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Hang a five pound weight off the - off the back. Weight.	no
27448	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	We	no
27449	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Hang a five pound weight off the back.	no
27450	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	We - at	no
27451	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Counter-balance.	no
27452	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	with a bunch of marbles in it	no
27453	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Or maybe this could be helpful just for evening the conversation between people. If people - those who talk a lot have to wear heavier weights or something, and - and -	no
27454	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah!	no
27455	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	um,	no
27456	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Anyway.	no
27457	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	um,	yes
27458	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	so, uh, what was I gonna say? Oh, yeah, I was gonna say, uh, I had these, uh, conversations with NIST folks also while I was there and - and, uh,	no
27459	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yep.	no
27460	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	um, so	no
27461	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	they - they have their - their plan for a room, uh, with, um,	no
27462	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	mikes in the middle of the table, and, uh, close-mounted mikes, and they're talking about close-mounted	no
27463	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	And arrays, which is the i- interesting - and video, right.	no
27464	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	And arrays, yep. And cameras.	no
27465	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	And yeah, like multiple - multiple video cameras coverin- covering every - everybody - every place in the room,	no
27466	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	uh, the - yeah - the - the mikes in the middle, the head-mounted mikes, the lapel mikes, the array, uh, with - well, there's some discussion of fifty-nine, they might go down to fifty-seven	no
27467	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Fifty-nine elements.	no
27468	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Because, uh,	no
27469	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	there is, uh, some pressure from a couple people at the meeting for them to use a KEMAR head.	no
27470	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I forget what KEMAR, uh, stands for, but what it is is it's dummy head that is very specially designed, and -	no
27471	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Mm-hmm.	no
27472	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh, that's right. Yep.	no
27473	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right. That's a great idea.	no
27474	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	and - and, so what they're actually doing is they're really - there's really two recording systems. So they may not be precisely synchronous, but the-	no
27475	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	but there's two - two recording systems, one with, I think, twenty-four channels, and one with sixty-four channels. And the sixty-four channel one is for the array,	no
27476	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	but they've got some empty channels there, and anyway they - like they're saying they may	no
27477	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	give up a couple or something if - for - for the KEMAR head if they go - go with that.	no
27478	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
27479	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, it	no
27480	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, h- uh, J- Jonathan Fiscus did say that,	no
27481	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So.	no
27482	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	uh, they have lots of software for doing calibration for skew and offset between channels and that they've found that's just not a big deal.	no
27483	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Mm-hmm	no
27484	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
27485	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So.	no
27486	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, I'm not	no
27487	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But they're still	no
27488	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	planning to do like fake - they have to do something like that, right.	no
27489	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Scenario-based.	no
27490	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Y- right. Their - their	no
27491	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	legal issues won't allow them to do otherwise.	no
27492	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
27493	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But it sounded like they were	no
27494	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, th- that's true.	no
27495	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Mm-hmm.	no
27496	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Mm-hmm.	no
27497	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Did - did they give a talk on this or was this informal?	no
27498	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	No. It's just informal.	no
27499	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	No.	no
27500	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	No, we just had some discussions, various discussions	no
27501	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah.	no
27502	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, I also sat and chatted with several of the NIST folks. They seemed like a good group.	no
27503	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	with them.	yes
27504	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, I also sat and chatted with several of the NIST folks. They seemed like a good group.	no
27505	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	What was the, um -	no
27506	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	the paper by, um, Lori Lamel that you mentioned?	no
27507	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Um,	no
27508	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Mmm, yeah.	no
27509	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	yeah, we sh- we should just have you - have you read it, but, I mea- ba- i- i- uh, we've all got these little proceedings, but, um,	no
27510	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	basically,	no
27511	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	it was about, um,	no
27512	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	uh, going to a new task where you have insufficient data and using - using data from something else, and adapting, and how well that works.	no
27513	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Uh, so in - in fact it was pretty related to what Liz and Andreas did, uh, except that this was not with meeting stuff, it was with	no
27514	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
27515	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	uh, like I think they s- didn't they start off with Broadcast News system? And then they went to -	no
27516	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	The- their Broadcast News was their acoustic models and then all the other tasks were much simpler.	no
27517	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
27518	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So they were command and control	no
27519	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	and that sort of thing.	no
27520	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	T_I-digits was one of them,	no
27521	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yep.	no
27522	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	and, uh,	no
27523	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Wall Street Journal.	no
27524	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	What was their	no
27525	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, read Wall Street Journal.	no
27526	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	rough - what was their conclusion?	no
27527	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	It works.	no
27528	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
27529	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well, it's - it's a good paper, I mean -	no
27530	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
27531	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, yeah.	no
27532	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, that was one of the ones that I liked. That - It not only works, in some cases it was	no
27533	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Bring the -	no
27534	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So.	no
27535	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	You know, the Broadcast News nets were - not	no
27536	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Probably.	no
27537	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
27538	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Did they ever try going -	no
27539	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	going the other direction from simpler task to more complicated tasks, or - ?	no
27540	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	n-	no
27541	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Not in that paper.	no
27542	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	That might be hard.	no
27543	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, well,	no
27544	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	one of the big	no
27545	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
27546	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Mm-hmm.	no
27547	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
27548	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But	no
27549	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
27550	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	like for the spr- speech proxy thing that I did? That's what I did.	no
27551	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, sure.	no
27552	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So. It works.	no
27553	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
27554	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, and they have - I mean - they have better adaptation than we had than that - that system, so they -	no
27555	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yep.	no
27556	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	um,	no
27557	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	You mean they have	no
27558	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	yeah, we should probably what would - actually what we should do, uh, I haven't said anything about this, but probably the five of us should	no
27559	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	pick out a paper or two	no
27560	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	that - that, uh, you know, got our interest, and we should	no
27561	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	go around the room at one of the Tuesday lunch meetings and say, you know, what - what was good about the conference, yeah.	no
27562	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Present.	no
27563	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yep.	no
27564	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Do a trip report.	no
27565	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well, the summarization stuff was interesting, I mean, I don't know anything about that field, but for this proposal	no
27566	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	on meeting summarization,	no
27567	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	um, I mean, it's sort of a far cry because they weren't working with meeting type data, but	no
27568	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
27569	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Do you remember who the groups were that we're doing?	no
27570	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	so.	no
27571	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well there're - this was the last day, but, I mean, there's - that's a huge field and probably the groups there may not be representative of the field, I - I don't know exactly	no
27572	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	A	no
27573	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	R- I think - Mm-hmm.	no
27574	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	that everyone submits to this particular conference, but	no
27575	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Was - were there folks from B_B_N presenting?	no
27576	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	yet there was, let's see,	no
27577	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	this was on the last day, Mitre, B_B_N,	no
27578	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Mitre, B_B_N, I_B_M.	no
27579	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	and, um,	no
27580	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Uh,	no
27581	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Maryland.	no
27582	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	um,	no
27583	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I wo- it was - no it was - this was Wednesday morning.	no
27584	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Columbia have anything? No.	no
27585	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Wasn't -	no
27586	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Who - who - who did the	no
27587	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	The sentence ordering one,	no
27588	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	was that	no
27589	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Ugh!	no
27590	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh.	no
27591	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Anyway, I - I - it's in the program, I should have read it to remind myself, but that's sort of useful and I think	no
27592	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	like when Mari and Katrin and Jeff are here it'd be good to figure out some kinds of	no
27593	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	things that we can start doing maybe just on the transcripts cuz we already have -	no
27594	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Mm-hmm.	no
27595	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, we	no
27596	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	you know, yeah.	no
27597	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well, I like the idea that	no
27598	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	generating	no
27599	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
27600	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	you know, and - and it has to be, though, someone from this	no
27601	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Someone who actually	no
27602	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But I think what's interesting is there's all these different evaluations, like -	no
27603	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I always write down the wrong things.	no
27604	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	just, you know, how do you evaluate whether the summary is good or not, and that's what's - was sort of interesting to me is that there's different ways to do it, and -	no
27605	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I	no
27606	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	A judge.	no
27607	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yep.	no
27608	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Was S_R_A one of the groups	no
27609	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	talking about summarization, no?	no
27610	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	No.	no
27611	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	It	no
27612	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	And as I said, I like the Microsoft talk on	no
27613	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
27614	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, that was an interesting discussion, uh,	no
27615	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	The -	no
27616	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I	no
27617	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	It - it - it was the	no
27618	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	The data issue comes up all the ti-	no
27619	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	It was the	no
27620	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well, I didn't have as much disagreement as I would have liked, but I didn't wanna - I wouldn- I didn't wanna get into it because, uh, you know, it was	no
27621	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	the application was one I didn't know anything about, uh, it just would have been, you know, me getting up to be argumentative, but -	no
27622	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yep.	no
27623	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	but, uh, I mean, the missing thi- so - so what they were saying - it's one of these things - is - you know, all you need is more data, sort of -	no
27624	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But I mea- i- wh- it -	no
27625	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well, it	no
27626	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah - yeah - yeah -	no
27627	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	"But it was - it was a very simple case of ""to"" versus ""too"" versus ""two"" and ""there"", ""their"", ""they're"" -"	no
27628	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	And there and their and - and that you	no
27629	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, yeah. O_K.	no
27630	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
27631	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
27632	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	And so, what they did was they had these different kinds of learning machines,	no
27633	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	"and they had different amounts of data, and so they did like, you know, eight different methods that everybody, you know, uh, argues about - about, ""Oh my - my kind of learning machine is better than your kind of learning machine."""	no
27634	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	And, uh, they were - started off with a million words that they used, which was evidently a number that a lot of people doing that particular kind of task had been using.	no
27635	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So they went up, being Microsoft, they went up to a billion.	no
27636	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	And then they had this log scale showing a -	no
27637	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Them being	no
27638	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
27639	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	You mean the bigger the company the more words they use for training?	no
27640	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well, I think	no
27641	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	the reason they can	no
27642	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So that's what they used as training data. It's just saying if it's in this corpus it's correct.	no
27643	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
27644	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	O_K. But, I mean, yes. Of course there was the kind of effect that, you know, one would expect that - uh - that you got better and better performance with more and more data.	no
27645	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Um, but the - the real point was that	no
27646	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	the - the different learning machines are sort of all over the place, and - and by - by going up significantly in data you can have much bigger effect	no
27647	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	then by switching learning machines and furthermore which learning machine was on top kind of depended on where you were in this picture, so, uh,	no
27648	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	This was my concern about the recognizer in Aurora.	no
27649	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	That -	no
27650	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	That the differences we're seeing in the front-end	no
27651	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
27652	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Are irrelevant.	no
27653	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	is b- are	no
27654	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
27655	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	If you add more data? Or -	no
27656	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
27657	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	You know?	no
27658	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Huh.	no
27659	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, could well be.	no
27660	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So - so, I mean, that was - that was kind of, you know, it's a good point,	no
27661	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	but the problem I had with it was that the implications out of this was that,	no
27662	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	uh, the kind of choices you make about learning machines were therefore irrelevant	no
27663	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	which is not at - n- t- as for as I know in - in tasks I'm more familiar with	no
27664	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	What i- what is - is true is that different learning machines have different properties,	no
27665	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	and you wanna know what those properties are. And someone else sort of implied that well we s- you know, a- all the study of learning machine we still don't know what those properties are.	no
27666	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	We don't know them perfectly, but we know	no
27667	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	that some kinds use more memory and - and some other kinds use more computation and some are - are hav- have limited kind of discrimination, but are just easy to use, and others are -	no
27668	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But doesn't their conclusion just sort of - you could have	no
27669	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	if you assume that these learning things get better and better and better,	no
27670	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	You would guess -	no
27671	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	then as you approach - there's a point where you can't get	no
27672	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
27673	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	It's just no -	no
27674	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But - No, but there was still a spread. They weren't all up- They weren't converging. They were all still spread.	no
27675	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	It w-	no
27676	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But what I'm saying is that th- they	no
27677	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But they - Right, right. Sure. But	no
27678	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	they hadn't even come close to that point.	no
27679	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
27680	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But they're all going the same	no
27681	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Eventually. O- one would thi-	no
27682	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But they	no
27683	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh they	no
27684	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	They just switched position.	no
27685	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well -	no
27686	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	well that's getting cl- I mean,	no
27687	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	yeah, the spread was still pretty wide that's th- that's true, but - but, uh,	no
27688	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yep.	no
27689	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I think it would be irntu- intu- intuition that this would be the case, but, uh, to really see it and to have the intuition is quite different, I mean, I think somebody	no
27690	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well it's different for different tasks. So it depends a lot on whether, you know, it - disambiguation is exactly the case where more data is better, right? You're -	no
27691	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah. It was Liz. Yeah.	no
27692	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
27693	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	you're - you can assume similar distributions, but if you wanted to do disambiguation on a different type of,	no
27694	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	uh, test data then your training data, then that extra data	no
27695	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
27696	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But, I think one of their p-	no
27697	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
27698	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	They - they had a	no
27699	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I think	no
27700	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right? Because their simplest, most brain-dead algorithm did pretty darn well	no
27701	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Mm-hmm.	no
27702	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	when you got - gave it a lot more data. And then	no
27703	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	"they were saying, ""Well, m- You"	no
27704	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	And everyone is still using it, so.	no
27705	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
27706	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But anyway, I - I - I think it's - it's just the - the i- it's - it's - it's not really the conclusion	no
27707	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But we could talk about this stuff, I think this would be fun to do.	no
27708	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Ha!	no
27709	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	as the conclusion	no
27710	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	that some of the, uh, uh, commenters in the crowd	no
27711	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
27712	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	going too far the other way, and - and the - the, uh,	no
27713	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Machine-learning.	no
27714	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	one - one person ga- g- g- got up and made a - a brief defense, uh, but it was a different kind of grounds, it was that - that, uh,	no
27715	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	i- w- the reason people were not using so much data before was not because they were stupid or didn't realize data was important, but in fact th- they didn't have it available.	no
27716	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Um, but the other point to make a- again is that, uh, machine learning still does matter,	no
27717	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	but it - it matters more in some situations than in others, and it - and also there's - there's not just mattering	no
27718	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	or not mattering, but there's mattering in different ways. I mean, you might be in some situation where	no
27719	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	you care how much memory you're using,	no
27720	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
27721	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	or you care, you know, what recall time is, or you care, you know, and - and -	no
27722	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Or you only	no
27723	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, or - or, uh -	no
27724	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	for your - some new task.	no
27725	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	"Or done another language, or - I mean, you - so there's papers on portability and rapid prototyping and blah-blah-blah, and then there's people saying, ""Oh, just add more data."" So, these are like two different religions, basically."	no
27726	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yep.	no
27727	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
27728	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
27729	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
27730	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	And there's cost!	no
27731	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Mm-hmm.	no
27732	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	There's just plain cost, you know, so - so these, I mean th- the - in the - in the	no
27733	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	if you - uh - one person	no
27734	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	has a system that requires ten thousand hours to train on,	no
27735	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	and the other only requires a hundred,	no
27736	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	and they both do about the same because the hundred hour one was smarter,	no
27737	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	that's -	no
27738	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	that's gonna be better.	no
27739	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yep.	no
27740	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	because people, I mean, there isn't gonna be just one system that people train on and then that's it for the r- for all of time. I mean, people are gonna be	no
27741	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	doing other different things, and so it - these - these things matters - matter.	no
27742	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, that's it. So, I mean, this was a very provocative slide. She put this up, and it was like this is -	no
27743	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, so that's one of the slides they put up.	no
27744	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
27745	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	"this p- people kept saying, ""Can I see that slide again?"" and then they'd make a comment, and one person said,"	no
27746	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, yeah.	no
27747	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	"well-known person said, um, you know, ""Before you dismiss forty-five years including"	no
27748	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Forty-five years of research.	no
27749	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
27750	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But th- you know, the same thing has happened in computational linguistics,	no
27751	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	right? You look at the A_C_L papers coming out, and now there's sort of a turn back towards, O_K we've learned statistic - you know, we're basically getting what we expect out of some statistical	no
27752	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	methods, and, you know, the- there's arguments on both sides, so -	no
27753	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yep. I think the	no
27754	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	That was very offending, very offending.	no
27755	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, yeah.	no
27756	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Is that - all -	no
27757	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
27758	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	"Maybe they should have said ""focus"" or something."	no
27759	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah. I mean, so. - And I'm saying the same thing happened with speech recognition, right? For a long time people were hand-c- coding linguistic rules and then they discovered machine-learning worked better.	no
27760	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	And now they're throwing more and more data and worrying -	no
27761	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	And - and then you hit this -	no
27762	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Except when they have a	no
27763	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
27764	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
27765	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Shall we read some digits?	no
27766	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Are we gonna do	no
27767	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Let's do it all at once. We -	no
27768	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yes!	no
27769	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, that's good.	no
27770	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	O_K.	no
27771	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So, and maybe we won't laugh this time also.	yes
27772	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So, and maybe we won't laugh this time also.	no
27773	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So remember to read the transcript number so that, uh, everyone knows that - what it is.	no

27840	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	No.	no
27841	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Oh.	no
27842	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	It's wired.	no
27843	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Oh!	no
27844	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Is that - Does that mean you can't hear anything during the meeting?	no
27845	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	It's old-school.	no
27846	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Huh? What? Huh?	no
27847	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Should we, uh, close the door, maybe? So it's - Yeah.	no
27848	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	It - it's a fairly good mike, actually.	no
27849	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Huh.	no
27850	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Well, I	no
27851	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	the quality.	no
27852	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Well, that's a	no
27853	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Ugh!	yes
27854	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	O_K.	no
27855	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	So, just to repeat the thing bef- that we said last week, it was there's this suggestion of alternating weeks on	no
27856	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Right.	no
27857	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	So which week are we	no
27858	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Well -	no
27859	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	We haven't	no
27860	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	we more - we more or less did	no
27861	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I thought we had a thing about speech recognition last week	no
27862	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
27863	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	But I figure also if they're	no
27864	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
27865	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I seem to be having	no
27866	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	So, uh, as most of you	no
27867	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	so far no one has made any -	no
27868	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Ach!	no
27869	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	any comments on them. So, no on- no one has bleeped out anything.	no
27870	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Um.	no
27871	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	So.	no
27872	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
27873	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I don't expect anyone to. But.	no
27874	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	So, w- what follows? At some point y- you go around and get people to	no
27875	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	No.	no
27876	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	We had spoken w- about this before and we had decided that they have - they	no
27877	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah, but I've forgotten.	no
27878	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	And the agreement that they	no
27879	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	So as long as we do that, we're covered.	no
27880	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Uh, July fifteenth.	no
27881	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Oh, so they have a- plenty of time, and y-	no
27882	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yep.	no
27883	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	um -	no
27884	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Jane told me July	no
27885	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Oh. I just meant that	no
27886	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	that was	no
27887	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Oh. I - I didn't understand that there was	no
27888	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I, uh -	no
27889	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	something	no
27890	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I thought -	no
27891	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I don't -	no
27892	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I had heard July fifteenth, so that's what I put. So.	no
27893	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	No, the only - th- the only	no
27894	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Mm-hmm.	no
27895	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	this	no
27896	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Oh,	no
27897	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	You said you wanted it to be available	no
27898	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	O_K.	no
27899	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Right.	no
27900	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	w-	no
27901	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	"in case, uh - you know, ""by the way"	no

27906	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
27907	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I mean the people who are in the meeti- this meeting was,	no
27908	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	uh, these - the meetings that - in - are in set one.	no
27909	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Was my - was my response O_K? I just wrote you - replied to the email saying they're all fine.	no

27912	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	O_K, good.	no
27913	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I - we don't - My understanding of what we	no

27915	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	uh, we don't	no
27916	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	We just need to	no
27917	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	O_K.	no
27918	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I just didn't remember, but -	no
27919	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	And so no reply is	no
27920	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	no changes.	no
27921	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	And he's	no
27922	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	O_K.	no
27923	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	"So that's very clear all the way down the page, ""O_K"". And they have two options they can change it to. One of them is"	no
27924	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	"Is it - is - your word is ""incorrect""? Which means also we get"	no
27925	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Right.	no
27926	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	that needs to be	no
27927	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Well -	no
27928	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah. The reason I did that it was just so that people would not censor - not ask to have stuff removed because it was	no
27929	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	as opposed to, uh -	no
27930	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	was because it, um - it gives them the	no
27931	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Right.	no
27932	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Approve it	no
27933	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	And	no
27934	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	So, you have	no

27936	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Mm-hmm.	no
27937	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	So.	no
27938	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Those are three - three of those. A different set of people. And we can impose -	no
27939	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	The	no
27940	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Uh,	no
27941	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah. Those -	no

27945	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Mm-hmm.	no
27946	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Oh, those are the N_S_A meetings?	no

27957	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	network services group. Yeah.	no
27958	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	O_K.	no
27959	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Uh-huh.	no
27960	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah,	no
27961	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I didn't mean to	no
27962	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Otherwise known as the German, Dutch, and Spanish.	no
27963	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah. Sorry. It was - it was not the best characterization.	no
27964	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Mm-hmm.	no
27965	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	n- no m- no overlap with our present members.	no
27966	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	And then maybe it'd be good to set an explicit deadline, something like	no
27967	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I mean, I would suggest we discuss - I mean, if we're going to have a	no
27968	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Mm-hmm.	no
27969	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	so that we have a uniform thing. So, tha- that's a month, which is fine. I mean, it seems -	no
27970	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Twelve hours.	no
27971	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Mm-hmm.	no
27972	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	we'll delete it from our	no
27973	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Hmm. That's a little bit difficult.	no
27974	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	What else can we do?	no
27975	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
27976	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	"If someone says ""hey, look, I"	no
27977	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	What can we do? We	no
27978	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I - I -	no
27979	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I think that somebody	no
27980	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Mm-hmm. Good.	no
27981	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	O_K, how long is a reasonable amount of time for people to have - if we say two weeks, or if we say a month,	no
27982	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	"""and, uh, because we w-"""	no
27983	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	these, uh - I would - I would imagine some sort of	no

27988	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Mm-hmm.	no
27989	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I'm just saying you should	no

27991	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	O_K.	no
27992	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah, yeah. O_K, so -	no
27993	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
27994	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I - I think that there's one missing line.	no
27995	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Well, the	no
27996	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Mm-hmm.	no
27997	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	And you	no
27998	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Right.	no
27999	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	So what I'm telling you	no
28000	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	and you should use	no
28001	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	O_K.	no
28002	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	O_K?	no
28003	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Because if someone -	no
28004	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	It - well, it - well, you're right. Sometimes somebody will be	no
28005	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	uh, choose	no
28006	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	O_K.	no
28007	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	That's - it's, you know, just a certain risk to take.	no
28008	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	S- so maybe when -	no
28009	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Oh. Hello? Hello?	no
28010	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	You	no
28011	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	You should be channel B_.	no
28012	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Oh, O_K. Alright. So. The, um -	no
28013	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Maybe we should say in -	no
28014	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	w- you know, when the whole thing	no
28015	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	that -	no
28016	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	you know, specify exactly	no
28017	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	uh, what,	no
28018	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	you know, how - how they will be contacted	no
28019	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	and they can, you know - they can be asked to give a phone number and an email address, or both.	no
28020	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	And, um, then -	no
28021	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Right. So.	no
28022	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
28023	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	A- And, then, you know, say very clearly that if they don't - if we don't hear from them,	no
28024	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	you know, as Morgan suggested, by a certain time or after a certain	no
28025	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	period after we	no
28026	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	that is implicitly giving their agreement.	no
28027	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Well, they've	no
28028	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	And nobody - nobody really reads it anyway.	no
28029	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	So. And the s- and the form was	no
28030	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Right.	no
28031	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Well, if that's i- tha- if that's already - if -	no
28032	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	approved by Human Subjects, so, eh, that's gonna be a little hard to modify.	no
28033	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Uh, the f-	no
28034	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I see.	no
28035	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Uh -	no
28036	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Oh, O_K.	no
28037	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	So what does it say about the - the - the	no
28038	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	It doesn't have a	no
28039	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	y- the review process?	no
28040	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	That you'll be provided access to the transcripts and then, uh, allowed to	no
28041	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Oh, O_K.	no
28042	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Hmm.	no
28043	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	before it goes to the general - uh,	no
28044	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Right.	no
28045	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Oh.	no
28046	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Here. You can read what you already signed.	no
28047	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	There you go.	no
28048	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I guess when I	no
28049	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I'm not as diligent as Chuck, but I had the feeling I should probably respond and tell Adam, like,	no

28054	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	And then if you - if the person thinks they'll need more time because they're out of town or whatever, they can tell you at that point?	no
28055	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Because -	no
28056	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	So what I	no

28059	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Well -	no
28060	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	O_K. So, we're	no
28061	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	but you should probably have a	no

28063	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	you know, someone who	no
28064	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	exercise their - their right -	no
28065	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Or they - they might never have gotten the	no

28073	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	No.	no
28074	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	It - we're hoping that doesn't happen, but that's why there's such a thing as registered mail or -	no

28076	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	That	no
28077	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	"Because people don't read their email, or they'll read and say ""I don't care about that, I'm not gonna delete anything"" and they don- just won't reply to it."	no

28093	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I mean, there's no way to get around -	no
28094	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I- It's pretty much the same am- amount of work except for an additional email just saying they	no

28110	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	If this is a purely administrative task, we can actually have	no

28118	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	you have to s- they've already	no
28119	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
28120	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah. We never really talked about that.	no
28121	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	O_K.	no
28122	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Or the date at which they would be receiving the email	no

28126	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	We	no
28127	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	made the, uh, uh, materials available. That was something that was sort of just within our implementation.	no
28128	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	We can use it - we can use a -	no
28129	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	O_K.	no
28130	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	a ploy like they use to, um -	no
28131	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	you know, that when they serve, like -	no
28132	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	uh, you know, like dead-beat dads, they - they - they make it look like they won something in the lottery	no
28133	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	And they're served.	no
28134	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Right? Because - and then the - the - the - the thing is served.	no
28135	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	"So you just make it, you know, ""oh, you won - you know, go to this web site and you've, uh - you're -"""	no
28136	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	That's why you never open these things that come in the mail.	no
28137	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	That one.	no

28139	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Right. No, it- I - it might -	no

28146	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	It might well be the case that - that this is perfectly -	no
28147	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	you know, this is enough to give us a basis t- to just, eh,	no
28148	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	assume their consent if they don't reply.	no
28149	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Mm-hmm.	no
28150	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	just wanna	no
28151	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Then I think we had better find out, so that we can find a -	no
28152	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
28153	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Right.	no
28154	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	For - for th-	no
28155	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	uh, to	no
28156	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Mm-hmm.	no
28157	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	of - of	no
28158	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	uh, h- how m-	no
28159	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	how much implication would there be that it's	no

28161	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Mm-hmm. I remember that.	no
28162	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	But, um, the	no
28163	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	that, um, you need to - you want to have someth- some paper trail or - which includes electronic trail -	no
28164	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	that they have, uh, in fact	no
28165	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Mm-hmm.	no
28166	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I think that if you f- i- if	no
28167	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	we can just make a	no
28168	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	"you know, just give it to me and I'll hand it to administrative staff or whatever, and they'll just call them up and say, you know, ""have you -"	no
28169	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Right.	no
28170	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Is - is this O_K? And would you please mail - you know, mail Adam that it	no
28171	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	So, you know, we can - we can do that.	no
28172	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	The other thing that there's a psychological effect that -	no
28173	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	at least for	no
28174	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Mm-hmm.	no
28175	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	And of course we don't	no
28176	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	it's a little bit better if we're getting the -	no
28177	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	their, uh, final response, once they've answered you	no
28178	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	That's how these mailing houses work. So, I mean, it's not	no

28228	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	that that's the intent of, uh, meaning here. So.	no
28229	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I mean, because they - they filled out a contact information and that's where I'm sending the information.	no
28230	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Right.	no
28231	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	And so far everyone has done email. There isn't anyone who did, uh,	no
28232	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	any other contact method.	no
28233	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
28234	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	So my original	no

28247	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Right.	no
28248	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Cuz people are swamped. But -	no
28249	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	didn't anticipate this so I - that's why I didn't give this comment, and it - I - this discussion has made me think it might be	no
28250	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	"to have a follow-up email within the next couple of days saying ""by the way, you know, we wanna hear back from you by X_ date"	no
28251	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	"and please -"", and then add what Liz said - ""please, uh, respond to - please indicate you received this mail."""	no

28260	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	if you were gonna p- if you're	no

28310	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Are you del- are you bleeping it by	no
28311	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	bleep it out and then -	no
28312	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	it's - it's	no
28313	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	So what I	no
28314	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I- I-	no
28315	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I- I understand, but is - is it	no
28316	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Oh, O_K. Cuz -	no
28317	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Oh. Cuz if you were	no
28318	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	No. But anyway -	no
28319	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah. It would be qui- quite easy to get it back again.	no
28320	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	And then w- I was gonna say also that the- they don't have to stay on the system, as you know, cuz - cuz the - the ones -	no
28321	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Then someday we can sell the	no
28322	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Say again?	no
28323	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Once it's been successfully bleeped, can't you rely on the - ?	no
28324	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Or	no
28325	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	You can	no
28326	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Oh, yeah.	no
28327	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Can't you rely on the archiving to preserve the older version?	no
28328	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Right. Exactly. I see.	no
28329	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	It wouldn't be that hard	no
28330	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	See, this is good. I wanted to create some	no
28331	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	to hide it.	no
28332	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	O_K.	no
28333	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	You can use spread spectrum. Hide it.	no
28334	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	you know, with a - with a two hundred bit -	no
28335	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Uh-huh.	no
28336	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah. Yeah. Cuz we don't have enough asides.	no
28337	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I have an idea. You reverse the signal, so it - it lets people say what they said backwards.	no
28338	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	There you go.	no
28339	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Backwards.	no
28340	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	ha- you've seen the - this - the speech recognition system that reversed very short segments. Did you read that paper?	no
28341	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
28342	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	No.	no
28343	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah. And if you do it backward then -	no
28344	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
28345	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	H_- good old H_M_M.	no
28346	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	That's cuz they use forward-backward.	no
28347	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Forward but backward. That's right. Good point.	no
28348	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Uh.	no
28349	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Hmm.	no
28350	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Uh.	no
28351	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	So. Yeah.	no
28352	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	This is the first cycle. There're bound to be some glitches the first time through.	no
28353	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	And, uh - and I'm sorry responding without, uh, having much knowledge, but the thing is, uh, I am, like, one of these people who gets a gazillion mails and - and stuff comes in as	no
28354	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
28355	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	you know, I have my	no
28356	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	that, you know, fifty or sixty	no
28357	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Move	no
28358	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah, right.	no
28359	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	So, i- this	no
28360	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Just re-mail	no
28361	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
28362	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah. That's actually definitely a good point. The m- email doesn't	no
28363	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
28364	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	that you can just reply to the email, as op- as opposed to going to the form and -	no
28365	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	In -	no
28366	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Mm-hmm.	no
28367	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Right.	no
28368	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	And it also doesn't give a - a specific - I didn't think of it.	no
28369	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	S- I think it's a good idea - an ex- explicit time by which this will be considered	no
28370	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah, release.	no
28371	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	definite.	no
28372	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	And - and it has to be a time earlier than that endpoint.	no
28373	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah. It's	no
28374	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	This - um, I've seen this recently. Uh, I got email, and it -	no
28375	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah. That's right.	no
28376	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	i- if I use a MIME-capable mail reader, it actually	no
28377	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	says, you know, click on this button to confirm receipt	no
28378	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Hmm.	no
28379	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Oh,	no
28380	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	So -	no
28381	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	A lot of mailers support return receipt. But it doesn't confirm that they've	no
28382	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	It's like certified mail.	no
28383	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Could	no
28384	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Right.	no
28385	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	No, no, no. This is	no
28386	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Mmm.	no
28387	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Right.	no
28388	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Oh, just a	no
28389	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	uh, th- there was a	no
28390	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	uh, you know, a actual acknowledgement to the	no
28391	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah. Unfor- Yeah, we could do that. But I	no
28392	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	But it o- but it only works for, you know, MIME-capable - you know, if you use Netscape or something like that for your n-	no
28393	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
28394	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	You might as well just	no
28395	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	And -	no
28396	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	And we actually need a	no
28397	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Right.	no
28398	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Oh?	no
28399	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Oh, I see.	no
28400	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	"uh, you know, I acknowledge -"""	no
28401	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	That i- i- my first-born children are yours, and - Yeah.	no
28402	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
28403	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Quick question. Are, um -	no
28404	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Well, I could put a U_R_L in there without any difficulty and	no
28405	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	But why shouldn't they just	no
28406	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah. Reply.	no
28407	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
28408	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Right.	no
28409	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
28410	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I appreciate it.	no
28411	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Well, I - cuz I use a	no

28418	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
28419	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	So - I - i-	no
28420	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	There's these logos	no
28421	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Wow.	no
28422	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Anyway, quick question. How m-	no
28423	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	You could put	no
28424	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
28425	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Like, there were	no
28426	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Six.	no
28427	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	But, no- of different people. So I guess if you're in	no
28428	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	How - I mean, it	no
28429	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Like, if we release - this time it's a fairly small number of meetings, but what if we release, like, twenty-five meetings to people?	no
28430	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	In th-	no
28431	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I don't know.	no
28432	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Oh. Oh, O_K. So this time was just the first chunk. O_K.	no
28433	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	So. Tha- that was my intention. It's just - yeah - that we just	no
28434	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Well, that's a good idea.	no
28435	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I mean, maybe - Is that	no
28436	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I agree with you.	no
28437	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	That was exactly right, that we had a - uh, uh -	no
28438	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I - I had wanted to get the entire set of twelve hours ready.	no
28439	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	But, uh, this was the biggest clump I could do by a time where I thought it was reasonable. People would be able to check it and still have it ready by then.	no
28440	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Mm-hmm.	no
28441	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Uh, unfortunately the time is later and I don't know how that's gonna work out, but I thought it'd be good to have	no
28442	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	But after	no
28443	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	O_K.	no
28444	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	We heard anything from I_B_M?	no
28445	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Adam	no
28446	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	And then, um,	no
28447	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	And so he's	no
28448	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah. Now we haven't actually had anyone go	no
28449	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	That's on my list.	no
28450	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Well, that's on my list.	no
28451	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	process.	no
28452	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	So.	no
28453	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Hmm.	no
28454	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	But I think - Yeah. Like you said, I mean, that's - that's gonna be our standard proc- that's what the transcribers are gonna be spending most of their time	no
28455	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Mm-hmm.	no
28456	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.	no
28457	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yes, absolutely. Yeah.	no
28458	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yes, absolutely. Absolutely.	no
28459	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Oh, interesting.	no
28460	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Oh, interesting. O_K.	no
28461	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah. They're - they're	no
28462	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	O_K.	no
28463	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	O_K.	no
28464	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Just they didn't get marked.	no
28465	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	O_K. So maybe when the detector for	no
28466	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	There's another issue which is this - we've been, uh, contacted by University of Washington now, of course, to, um -	no
28467	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	We sent them the transcripts that correspond to those	no
28468	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	and they're downloading the	no
28469	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	audio files. So they'll be doing that. Chuck's - Chuck's, uh,	no
28470	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	put that in.	no
28471	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Mm-hmm. Yeah, I pointed them to the set that Andreas put, uh, on the	no
28472	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	web so th- if they want to compare directly with	no
28473	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	And, um, then once, uh,	no
28474	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	th- we can also point them at the, um,	no
28475	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	uh, the original meetings	no
28476	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	and they can grab those, too, with S_C_P.	no
28477	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Wait. So you put the	no
28478	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Or the - ?	no
28479	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	No, I mean of the	no
28480	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Um.	no
28481	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Well, we can talk about it off-line.	no
28482	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Mm-hmm.	no
28483	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Right? Yeah, so we have to finish by three forty-five.	no
28484	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	D- d- So, does Washi- does - does U_W wanna u- do this - wanna use this data for	no
28485	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Uh, for recognition.	no
28486	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I think they're doing w- didn't they want to do language modeling on, you know, recognition-compatible transcripts	no
28487	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I see.	no
28488	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
28489	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	So, this is from one of the N_S_A meetings and, uh, i- if you're familiar with the diff format, the arrow to the left is what it	no
28490	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	"And now the first one. ""O_K. So, then we started a weekly meeting."	no
28491	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	"The last time, uh -"" And the"	no
28492	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	But,	no
28493	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	"really, um, it was ""we"	no
28494	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	And these - the parentheses were f- from -	no
28495	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Oh, this - that's the convention for indicating uncertain. So the transcriber was	no
28496	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	U- uncertains.	no
28497	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	S-	no
28498	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	You know, she was	no
28499	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	O_K.	no
28500	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Oh.	no
28501	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	And it's also a g- a good indication of the - of that. The next one. This was about, uh, Claudia and	no
28502	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Web master.	no
28503	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	And then you see another type of uncertainty which is, you know, they just didn't	no
28504	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yep.	no
28505	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	"So instead of ""split upon unknown"","	no
28506	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Jane, these are from I_B_M? The top lines?	no
28507	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Spit upon?	no
28508	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	No, no. These are - these are	no
28509	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	No, these are	no
28510	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Oh.	no
28511	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Oh, I see.	no
28512	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	My -	no
28513	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	O_K.	no
28514	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	especially	no
28515	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Discourse markers.	no
28516	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Discourse markers.	no
28517	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	S-	no
28518	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Sorry, what?	no
28519	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Discourse markers? Sure. Sure, sure, sure. And it's - and it makes sense cuz it's, like, below this - it's a little subliminal there.	no
28520	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
28521	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah, yeah.	no
28522	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	uh,	no
28523	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	"But really it's ""Q_S in advance"". I mean, I - I've benefited from some of these, uh, cross-group meetings."	no
28524	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	O_K, then you got, um,	no
28525	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	"uh, instead of ""from something-or-other cards"","	no
28526	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	"And instead of """	no
28527	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	"And then, you can see here ""G_P_S"" was misinterpreted."	no
28528	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	It's just	no
28529	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Um, and the	no
28530	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	"the transcriber had th- ""in the core network"	no
28531	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	"And it - it comes through as ""in the core network itself of the"	no
28532	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Mmm.	no
28533	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	And they're generally	no
28534	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	but, you know in this - this area it really does	no
28535	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	the	no
28536	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah. So how often - ?	no
28537	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah, but I bet - I bet they're acoustically challenging parts anyway, though.	no
28538	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Mmm.	no
28539	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	No, actually	no
28540	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Oh, really? Uh, it's - Oh, so it's just jargon.	no
28541	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	It's jargon. Yeah. I mean this is - cuz, you know you don't realize in daily life how much you have top-down influences in what you're hearing.	no
28542	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	But - but -	no
28543	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	But we don't - I mean, our language model right now doesn't know about these words anyhow.	no
28544	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	you know, un- until you actually	no
28545	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
28546	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	It probably won't do any better.	no
28547	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	But it's - I mean, it's definitely good that these are fixed. I mean,	no
28548	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
28549	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	uh, um, barely decipherable w- you know, sentences, and then is asked to approve of it or not,	no
28550	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Did I say that?	no
28551	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
28552	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	"Yeah. That would be a shame if people said ""well, I don't approve it because"	no
28553	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	O_K.	no
28554	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Well, that's exactly why I put the extra option in,	no
28555	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Exactly. That's why we discussed that.	no
28556	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	is that I was	no
28557	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
28558	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
28559	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
28560	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	C-	no
28561	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	And - and they	no
28562	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I mean, I - I think that there will be fewer things to correct because of the - the choice. We'd originally chosen, uh,	no
28563	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Ugh!	no
28564	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	in this - with this respect to this particular task.	no
28565	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Well, return the old ones.	no
28566	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	It's probably impedance matching problems. But -	no
28567	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I don't know exactly, but we chose them because that's what's been used here by prominent projects in transcription. So it i- we had every reason to think they would work. Sorry, what?	no
28568	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Could be.	no
28569	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Mm-hmm.	no
28570	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	So you have spare headsets?	no
28571	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	No, no. I mean, just earphones?	no
28572	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Right.	no
28573	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Um,	no
28574	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	because I, uh,	no
28575	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I could use one on my workstation, just to t- because sometimes I have to listen to audio files and I don't have to b- go	no
28576	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	someone and -	no
28577	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	We have actua- actually I have - W- Well, the thing is, that if we have four people come to work	no
28578	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Oh, O_K.	no
28579	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	for, eh - for spares, but I can tell you what I recommend.	no
28580	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Sure. No problem. I just -	no
28581	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	But if you need it, just	no
28582	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah. If you	no
28583	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
28584	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah, I still - I still need to get a pair, too.	no
28585	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	It'd just have to be a s- a separate order - an added order.	no
28586	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah, that -	no
28587	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	We should order a cou- uh, t-	no
28588	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I'm using one of these. Yeah.	no
28589	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	two or three or four, actually. We have -	no
28590	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I think I have a pair that I brought from home, but it's f- just for music listening and it's not - Nnn. Yeah.	no
28591	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	No. Just - just - just - just buy them.	no
28592	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Sh- Just get the model number and - Where do you buy these from? Like - ?	no
28593	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Just buy them.	no
28594	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
28595	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	You just b- go and b-	no
28596	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah. They always have them in stock.	no
28597	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
28598	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Anyway.	no
28599	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	That'd be a good idea.	no
28600	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	W- uh, could you email out the brand?	no
28601	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
28602	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Oh, sure. Yeah. O_K.	no
28603	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Cuz I think - sounds like people are interested. So.	no
28604	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
28605	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Definitely.	no
28606	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
28607	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	It's made a difference in - in how easy. Yeah.	yes
28608	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	It's made a difference in - in how easy. Yeah.	no
28609	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I realized something I should talk about. So what's the other thing on the agenda	no
28610	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Uh, the only one was Don wanted to, uh, talk about	no
28611	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	disk space yet again.	no
28612	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
28613	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	u- It's short. I mean, if you wanna go, we can just throw it in at the end.	no
28614	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	No, no. Why don't you - why don't you go ahead since it's short.	no
28615	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Um, well, uh.	no
28616	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Oh, I thought you meant the disk space. Yeah, we	no
28617	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	The disk space was short. Yeah. That's what I thought too.	no
28618	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	It's one of these - it's - it's	no
28619	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	It's -	no
28620	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
28621	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I- i- i- it- i-	no
28622	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah, it's	no
28623	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Sorry.	no
28624	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Uh, well, we'll	no
28625	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
28626	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Um.	no
28627	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	So, um, without thinking about it, when I offered up my	no
28628	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Oh, no.	no
28629	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Um, this is always a suspect phrase.	no
28630	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	But, um,	no
28631	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	o- for this, uh, paper we're writing, so we're probably gonna need a lot more - We're probably gonna need	no
28632	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	um, we also have someone else coming in that's gonna help us out with some stuff. So -	no
28633	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	We've just ordered a hundred gigabytes.	no
28634	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	O_K. We just need to -	no
28635	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Well, we're getting three thirty - thirty-sixes.	no
28636	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	So.	no
28637	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	O_K.	no
28638	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Right? That are going into the main f- file server. So.	no
28639	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	O_K.	no
28640	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Markham's ordering and they should be coming in soon.	no
28641	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	W- Well. So - so -	no
28642	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Soon?	no
28643	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah. I mean, I guess the thing is is, all I need is to hang it off, like,	no
28644	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	the person who's coming in, Sonali's, computer.	no
28645	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Whew.	no
28646	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Or we can	no
28647	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	No.	no
28648	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Or	no
28649	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Ne- new disks.	no
28650	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Onto Abbott, the file server.	no
28651	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	So are we gonna move the stuff off of my hard drive onto that when those come in? O_K. That's fine.	no
28652	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Oh, oh. O_K.	no
28653	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Once they come in. Sure.	no
28654	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Uh, i-	no

28657	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	O_K. So -	no
28658	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I think if I'm -	no
28659	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	But I - I vacillate between no space free and	no
28660	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
28661	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah. I think I can find something if I'm desperate and, um, in the meantime I'll just hold out. That was the only thing I wanted to bring up.	no
28662	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	O_K.	no
28663	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	It should be	no
28664	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	O_K.	no
28665	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	So there's another hundred gig. So.	no
28666	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Alright. Great.	no
28667	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Mm-hmm.	no
28668	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	O_K.	no

28670	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Good.	no
28671	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
28672	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
28673	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Well, each	no
28674	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
28675	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	real disk space.	no
28676	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
28677	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Oh, yeah.	no
28678	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	get together and talk about, uh, where we are on things. Uh, there's this meeting coming	no
28679	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	uh, and there's	no
28680	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	She was re- she was referring to it as - I think this actually	no
28681	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Um, she's referring to it as the an- annual report for the fiscal	no
28682	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	why we do an annual report that	no
28683	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	She's either really late or really early.	no
28684	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	we're writing in July.	no
28685	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Huh.	no
28686	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	So anyway, I'll be putting together stuff. I'll do it,	no
28687	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	uh, you know, as much as I can without bothering people, just by looking at - at papers and status reports. I mean, the status reports you do are very helpful.	no
28688	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Hmm.	no
28689	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Uh, so I can grab stuff there. And if, uh - if I have some questions I'll -	no

28691	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
28692	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Uh, but, you know, I'm - I'm sure before	no
28693	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Um.	no
28694	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	But, um, I don't know, I guess - I guess I know	no
28695	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	pretty	no
28696	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Uh.	no
28697	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	But, um.	no
28698	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Um.	no
28699	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah. So that wasn't a long one. Just to	no
28700	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	tomorrow afternoon, and if something hasn't been in a status report and you think it's important thing to mention on	no
28701	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	this kind of thing, uh, uh, just pop me a one-liner and - and - and I'll - I'll have it in front of me for the phone conversation.	no
28702	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	O_K.	no
28703	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Uh.	no
28704	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I guess, uh, you- you're still	no
28705	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	pecking away at the	no
28706	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yep.	no
28707	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	And Don is	no
28708	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Oh, that's right.	no
28709	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	O_K.	no
28710	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Did you wanna talk about that this afternoon?	no
28711	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Um.	no
28712	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Not here, but later today?	no
28713	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	O_K.	no
28714	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	a few days off the following week,	no
28715	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	a- after the - after the picnic. So.	no
28716	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Oh, O_K.	no
28717	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	That's all I had.	no
28718	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	So we were gonna do sort of	no
28719	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	status of speech transcription - automatic transcription, but we're kind of running late. So.	no
28720	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	How long does it take you to save the data?	no
28721	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Fifteen minutes. So.	no
28722	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	If you wanna do a quick	no

28765	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	A woman of few words.	no
28766	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	But - but lots of prosody.	no
28767	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Uh, I mean, we - we really	no
28768	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Th-	no
28769	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Excuse me?	no
28770	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Well, since last	no
28771	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah, we're -	no
28772	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I mean, the - the next thing on our agenda is to go back and look at the, um -	no
28773	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	the automatic alignments because, uh, I got some -	no
28774	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I - I - I learned from Thilo what data we can use as a	no
28775	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	benchmark to	no
28776	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	see how well we're doing on automatic alignments of the background speech - or, of the	no
28777	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
28778	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	But, we haven't actually -	no
28779	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	And then, uh, I guess,	no
28780	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	the new data that Don will start to process - the, um -	no
28781	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	when he can get these - You know, before we were working with	no
28782	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	these segments that were all	no
28783	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Mmm.	no
28784	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Oh. Right, right.	no
28785	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	timed sp- at - on either side.	no
28786	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Mm-hmm.	no
28787	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	And so that's sort of a	no
28788	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	stage-two of trying the same kinds of alignments with the tighter boundaries with them is really the next step.	no
28789	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Right.	no
28790	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I'll be interested.	no
28791	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	We did get our, um - I guess,	no
28792	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	uh, New Jersey.	no
28793	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	And we sent in a very poor abstract, but they -	no
28794	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	When's it due?	no
28795	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	The t- paper isn't due until August. The abstracts were already due. So it's that kind of workshop.	no
28796	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Mm-hmm.	no
28797	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	But, I mean, the good news is that that will have	no
28798	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	sort of the European experts in prosody - sort of a different crowd, and I think we're the only people working on prosody in meetings so far, so that should be interesting.	no
28799	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Uh, it's	no
28800	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	It's called Prosody to -	no
28801	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	ISCA Workshop on Prosody in	no

28804	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Good.	no
28805	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Uh, so it's focused on using prosody in automatic systems and there's a -	no
28806	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	um, a web page	no
28807	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	for it.	no

28917	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	transcriptions from the	no
28918	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	probably	no
28919	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	five or six	no
28920	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah, I think we're up to M_R thirteen or something.	no
28921	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	m- more meetings.	no
28922	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah, so um, I guess she's hired some new transcribers and -	no
28923	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mmm.	no
28924	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Which meetings is she transcribing?	no
28925	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Speaking -	no
28926	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Um well we've - we've run out of E_D_Us because a certain number of them are um, sort of	no
28927	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	O_K.	no
28928	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	awaiting	no
28929	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	to go to I_B_M.	no
28930	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	For I_B_M, yeah.	no
28931	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	O_K.	no
28932	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Hmm.	no
28933	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	and the rest are in process being transcribed uh here.	no
28934	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So we're doing some in parallel.	no
28935	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So does she have transcribers right now who are basically sitting idle because there's no data back from	no
28936	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yep.	no
28937	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	No.	no
28938	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	No, no. We haven't done that process. So. They'r- they're doing the full transcription process.	no
28939	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I_B_M no?	no
28940	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Oh.	no
28941	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Oh, O_K.	no
28942	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
28943	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So they're just doing their own thing until -	no
28944	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Because I -	no
28945	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	We're doing it in parallel, yeah.	no
28946	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	O_K.	no
28947	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I need to ask Jane whether it's - it would be O_K for her -	no
28948	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	um, s- some of her people to	no
28949	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	transcribe uh some of the initial data we got from the SmartKom data collection, which is these short like five or seven minute sessions.	no
28950	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yep.	no
28951	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Um and we want it - You know, we need -	no
28952	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	The -	no
28953	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	logistic set-up where we	no
28954	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
28955	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	But to get	no
28956	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yep, sounds familiar.	no
28957	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	And so um I wanted to ask Jane if - if	no
28958	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	uh, you know, maybe one of their	no
28959	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	transcribers could - could do - I mean since these are very	no
28960	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
28961	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	um -	no
28962	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	There's only two channels.	no
28963	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So it's only - Yeah. As the synthesis doesn't have to be	no
28964	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	It's - Yeah. It's only two -	no
28965	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right, s-	no
28966	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah. So - So it's basically one channel to transcribe. And it's - One session is only	no
28967	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	uh like seven -	no
28968	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So that should have ma- many fewer - And it's also not uh- a bunch of interruptions with people and all that, right? So.	no
28969	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right. And	no
28970	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	the thing that they're reading and they just may -	no
28971	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Make sure it's right.	no
28972	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	And so um,	no
28973	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yep.	no
28974	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	um, I guess since she's - I was gonna ask her but since she's not around I - maybe I'll -	no
28975	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah, well it certainly seems -	no
28976	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Uh if - if that's O_K with you to - to, you know,	no
28977	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
28978	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	get that stuff uh - to ask her for that, then I'll do that.	no
28979	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah, if we're held up on this other stuff a	no
28980	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
28981	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	O_K, yeah.	no
28982	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
28983	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Alrighty.	no
28984	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Oh, yeah, and also related to the	no
28985	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Can you mail that out to the list?	no
28986	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm, yeah I will. I - That's the thing that I sent out just to	no
28987	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Oh, O_K, O_K.	no
28988	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I'll send it out to the list telling people to look at it.	no
28989	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah, I haven't done that. So. I have lots of stuff to add that's just in my own directory. I'll try to get to that.	no
28990	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	yes
28991	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	O_K. So Jane also wanted to talk about participant approval, but I don't really think there's much to talk about. I'm just gonna do it.	no
28992	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	You are going to -	no
28993	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I'm gonna send out to the participants, uh, with links to web pages which contain the transcripts and allow them to	no
28994	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	O_K.	no
28995	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	For the ones that we have.	no
28996	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So but it's just transcripts, not the - not the audio?	no
28997	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Um -	no
28998	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Nope, they'll have access to the audio also.	no
28999	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	O_K, yeah, yep. Ah.	no
29000	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I mean that's my intention. Because the transcripts might not be right. So you want people to be able to listen to them.	no
29001	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
29002	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So -	no
29003	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
29004	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So, um the audio that they're gonna have access to, will that be the	no
29005	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Oh, that's a good point.	no
29006	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	That's a good point. Yeah, it's - it's probably going to have to be the	no
29007	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Hmm.	no
29008	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah, I was just wondering because we're uh running out of the un-backed-up disk space on	no
29009	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Well, that was the other point.	no
29010	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Oh, was that another one? O_K. I'll wait.	no
29011	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So, uh -	yes
29012	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	But that is a good point so we'll get to that, too. Um, DARPA demo status, not much to say. The back-end stuff is working out fine. It's more or less ready to go. I've added some stuff that uh indes- indexes by the meeting type M_R, E_D_U, et cetera and also by the user I_D.	no
29013	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So that the	no
29014	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Uh -	no
29015	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	The back-end is uh, going more slowly as I s- I think I said before just cuz I'm not much of a Tcl-T_K programmer.	no
29016	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
29017	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	But uh	no
29018	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Oh-	no
29019	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	As pretty as we	no
29020	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I wondered whe- when we would reach Dave's saturation point. He's sort of been - been volunteering for everything and	no
29021	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
29022	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	O_	no
29023	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Um -	no
29024	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	And, also um,	no
29025	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I was just showing Andreas, I got um an X_Waves	no
29026	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	kind of display, and I don't know how much more we can do with it - with like the prosodic stuff where we have like stylized pitches and signals and the transcripts on the bottom so, right now it's just an X_Waves and then you have three windows but I don't know, it looked pretty nice and I'm sure it - think it has potential for	no
29027	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Oh, cool.	no
29028	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	For a demo?	no
29029	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	a little something, yeah, for a demo.	no
29030	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So -	no
29031	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	O_K, so again, the issue is - For July, the issue's gonna be what can we fit into a Windows machine, uh, and so on, but -	no
29032	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Oh.	no
29033	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So it might just be slides.	no
29034	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah, O_K. Well, we'll see, um -	no
29035	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I've been putting together uh Transcriber things for Windows so i- And I installed it on Dave Gelbart's P_C and it worked just fine. So hopefully that will work.	no
29036	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Really? So is that -	no
29037	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Because there's some people um -	no
29038	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	It would be cool if we could uh get that to work uh at - at S_R_I because the um -	no
29039	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
29040	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yep.	no
29041	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	we have m- m- We have more Windows machines to run the -	no
29042	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Transcriber is Tcl-T_K, very generic with Snack, so basically anything you can get Snack to run on, it will work.	no
29043	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
29044	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
29045	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
29046	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah but - But the problem is	no
29047	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	the version Transcriber works with, the Snack version, is one point six whatever and that's not anymore supported. It's not on - on the web page anymore. But I just wrote an email to - to the author of - to the Snack author and he sent me to one point six whatever library and so it works.	no
29048	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Well I thought it was packaged with	no
29049	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah, but then you can't add our patches and then	no
29050	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Oh.	no
29051	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	the - the new version is - is totally different a- and in - yeah, in terms of - of the source code. You - you can't find the Tcl files anymore. It's some whatever wrapped thing and you can't - you can't access that so	no
29052	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Ah.	no
29053	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mmm.	no
29054	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	you have to install - First install Tcl then install Snack and then install the Transcriber thing and	no
29055	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	do the patches. Yeah.	no
29056	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Patch. Ugh!	no
29057	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I - I wonder if - if we should	no
29058	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	contribute our changes back to the authors so that they maintain those changes along - We have? Oh.	no
29059	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
29060	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	We have -	no
29061	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Oh, O_K.	no
29062	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So did you um	no
29063	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	put the uh -	no
29064	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	No, I haven't done that yet. I'm -	no
29065	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	But I definitely will do that.	no
29066	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So, can some of the stuff that Don's talking about somehow fit into this	no
29067	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Uh, mean you just have a set of numbers that are associated with the -	no
29068	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
29069	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah, it's basically ASCII files or binary files, whatever representation. Just three different - It's a waveform and	no
29070	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So -	no
29071	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	just a stylized pitch vector basically so it's -	no
29072	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So - So - Well -	no
29073	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I mean we could do it in Matl-	no
29074	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	But - But it would be cool if the Transcriber interface had like another window for the - you know, maybe above the waveform where it would show some arbitrary	no
29075	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yep.	no
29076	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
29077	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	valued function that is - that is you know time synchron- ti-	no
29078	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah, that'd be very cool.	no
29079	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yes.	no
29080	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	It'd be easy enough to add that. Again it's - it's	no
29081	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	ti- time synchronous with the waveform.	no
29082	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
29083	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
29084	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
29085	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	But it would almost be like having another waveform displayed. S- Right.	no
29086	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
29087	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yep.	no
29088	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yep.	no
29089	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
29090	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
29091	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	But it - it seems to me that	no
29092	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	And -	no
29093	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I c-	no
29094	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	It doesn't seem like having that real time is that necessary. So yo- It seems to me you could do images.	no
29095	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Um	no
29096	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Like being able to scroll through it and stuff for the demo.	no
29097	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	O_K.	no
29098	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Is that what you mean? Yeah.	no
29099	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah, jus-	no
29100	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	It would be cool to see it - It would be cool like to see -	no
29101	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	to hear it and see it, and see the pitch contours also.	no
29102	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	And to	no
29103	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
29104	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Sure, but I don't think - I - You can do all that just statically in PowerPoint.	no
29105	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I think it would lose -	no
29106	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah, I mean y-	no
29107	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Just record the audio clip and show an image and I think that's -	no
29108	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right, right.	no
29109	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I just thought if you meant slides I thought you meant like just	no
29110	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	like	no
29111	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	um	no
29112	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	You know, wh- Yeah. So. Uh, no, we're talking about on the computer and - and um, I think when we were talking about this before we had littl- this little demo meeting, we sort of set up a range of different degrees of liveness that you could have	no
29113	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
29114	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
29115	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	um -	no
29116	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
29117	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	in -	no
29118	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Cuz a lot of this stuff,	no
29119	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
29120	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mmm.	no
29121	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	see them.	yes
29122	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	And the last i- item on the agenda is disk issues yet again. So, we're doing O_K on backed up. We're - We're only about thirty percent on the second disk.	no
29123	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So, uh,	no
29124	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	we have a	no
29125	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
29126	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	And, my original intention was like we would just delete them as we needed more space, but unfortunately we're in the position where we have to deal with all the meeting data	no
29127	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
29128	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Oh there's a lot of	no
29129	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah, there're a lot of transcribers, so all of those need to be expanded, and then people are doing chunking and I want to do uh, uh,	no
29130	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
29131	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
29132	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	An-	no
29133	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
29134	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	uh, the permission forms, so I want those to be live, so there's a lot of data that has to be around.	no
29135	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Um -	no
29136	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	And Jane was gonna talk to, uh, Dave Johnson about it. One of the things I was thinking is we - we just got these hundred - alright, excuse me - ten, uh	no
29137	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	SPARC-Blade	no
29138	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Did they come in?	no
29139	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	SUN-Blades. They came in but they're not set up yet. And so it seems to me we could hang scratch disk on those	no
29140	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	SUN-Blades. Yeah. They came in the other day.	no
29141	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
29142	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Oh.	no
29143	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Well, is there - Why not just hang	no
29144	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
29145	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Because there's no more room in the	no
29146	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Ah.	no
29147	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Ah, I see.	no
29148	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Weren't we gonna get - Well, maybe it should get another rack.	no
29149	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	But you	no
29150	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Well, but the SUN-Blades have spare drive bays.	no
29151	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So -	no
29152	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Just put them in.	no
29153	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	You can put two -	no
29154	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Oh you mean you put them inside the pizza boxes for the -	no

29157	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
29158	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Oh.	no
29159	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Cuz the SUN - uh, these SUN-Blades take commodity hard drives. So you can just go out and buy a P_C hard drive and stick it in.	no
29160	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mmm.	no
29161	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	But if Abbott is going to be our disk server it - it -	no

29169	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	You mean he won't set up the - mmm.	no
29170	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	How much space do you need for these?	no
29171	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I don't know. I don't know what his schedule is. I'm just saying he's gone.	no
29172	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	You - we need about a gig per meeting.	no
29173	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I - I thi-	no
29174	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yep.	no
29175	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I have um - I have an eighteen gig drive hanging off of my computer.	no
29176	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Alright! What's your computer's name?	no
29177	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So -	no
29178	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Uh, Samosa.	no

29181	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
29182	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So, I didn't realize it was so critical. I mean I'm not doing anything on it right now until I get new meetings to transcri- or that are - new transcriptions coming in I really can't do anything.	no
29183	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	And you're o- you're offering?	no
29184	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	O_K.	no
29185	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I - I jus- I just gave Thilo some - about ten gigs, the last ten gigs of space that there was on - on uh Abbott.	no
29186	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Um not that I can't do anything, I jus-	no
29187	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Uh -	no
29188	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	And uh - So but that - But -	no
29189	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Which one was that, X_	no
29190	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	X_G.	no
29191	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	X_G.	no
29192	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
29193	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	X_G?	no
29194	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	That's also where we store the -	no
29195	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	The uh Hub-five training set waveforms, right?	no
29196	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Oops.	no
29197	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	No. I don't think that's on X_G. On X_G is only Carmen and Du- and Stephane's disk.	no
29198	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	But that won't be getting any bigger, will it?	no
29199	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
29200	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	It's - Yeah.	no
29201	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	But I've also been storing - I've been storing the	no
29202	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Well -	no
29203	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah, I do- I don't think it was on X_G. I th-	no
29204	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I have a lot of space, though.	no
29205	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Uh -	no
29206	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Isn't that X_H?	no
29207	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I have a lot of space and it's not - it's n- There's very little uh - Yeah not for long. But I mean it's not going f- It's not being used often at all.	no
29208	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Not - not for long.	no
29209	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Oh that's X_A - Oh that's X_ -	no
29210	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Maybe I'm confu- Oh no I'm sorry.	no
29211	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	But I'm using X_H - H_, too. So.	no
29212	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah, it's probably - Probably only about four gig is on X_ - on your X_ drive, but we'll definitely take it up if you -	no
29213	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Oh O_K.	no
29214	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I th-	no
29215	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I think you're right. It's	no
29216	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I think it's about four or five gig cuz I have	no
29217	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Great.	no
29218	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So.	no
29219	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	We need -	no
29220	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	O_K, so that will get us through the next couple days.	no
29221	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	We need another gigaquad.	no
29222	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yep.	no
29223	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	There should - I d- There should just be a b- I should have a button.	no
29224	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	"Just press - Press each meeting saying ""we need more disk space"""	no
29225	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	"The ""more disk space"" button?"	no
29226	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Well we've collected so far something like	no
29227	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	uh sixty-five meetings.	no
29228	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	And - And how much does each meeting take?	no
29229	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	And it's	no
29230	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	about a gig uncompressed.	no
29231	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	It's - It's a little bit more as I usually don't - do not uncompress the - all of the P_Z_M and the P_D_A things. So.	no
29232	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Is a little more?	no
29233	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right, yeah so if you uncompressed	no
29234	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	It's -	no
29235	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
29236	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	One point five or something.	no
29237	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Half a gig.	no
29238	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	About half?	no
29239	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
29240	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah. Yep.	no
29241	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So we're definitely are storing	no
29242	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	you know, all of those.	no
29243	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So there's what thirty some gig	no
29244	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So- so- So maybe there's a hundred	no
29245	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	of just meetings so far?	no
29246	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
29247	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I mean. Cuz we - we have the uncompressed around also. So it's like -	no
29248	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right. Right. Well we - We haven't uncompressed all the meetings, but -	no
29249	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
29250	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I would	no
29251	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah. Well I mean it's - the- they really are cheap. I mean it's just a question of figuring out	no
29252	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
29253	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yep.	no
29254	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	But uh, we could - You know, if you want to get four disks, get four disks. I mean it's - it's small - I mean these things ar- are just a few hundred dollars.	no
29255	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah. Well I sent that message out to, I guess, you and Dave asking for - if we could get some disk. I s- I sent this out	no
29256	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
29257	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	And put it	no
29258	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
29259	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	a - a day ago but - and Dave didn't respond so I don- I don't know	no
29260	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	how the whole process	no
29261	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yep.	no
29262	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So I was	no
29263	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah, I think you need a direct conversation with him. And just	no
29264	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
29265	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Wa- a- I	no
29266	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
29267	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Um -	no
29268	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
29269	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So the question is where are you gonna	no
29270	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
29271	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I don't know what the	no
29272	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
29273	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So.	no
29274	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right. So this is a question that's pretty hard to solve without talking to Dave, cuz it -	no
29275	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Th- The -	no
29276	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I think part of the reason why Dave can't get the - the	no
29277	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	One -	no
29278	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mmm.	no
29279	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yep.	no
29280	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	One - One	no
29281	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	On- One thing to in- to um t- to do when you need to conserve space is	no
29282	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I bet there are still some old, uh, like, nine gig disks, uh,	no
29283	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	around and you can probably consolidate them onto larger disks and - and you know recover the space.	no
29284	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yep.	no
29285	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah. No. I think Dave - Dave knows all these things, of course. An- and so, he always has a- a lot of plans of things that he's gonna do to make things better in many ways an- and runs out of time.	no
29286	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
29287	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
29288	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	But I - I know that	no
29289	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mmm.	no
29290	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	the back - the	no
29291	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mmm.	no
29292	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Well. So. But this - this is a very specific question for me. Basically, we can easily get	no
29293	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Which -	no
29294	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Maybe we can put some disks in the - in that back room there.	no
29295	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah really.	no
29296	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Attach to -	no
29297	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Popcorn.	no
29298	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	To the machine that collects the	no
29299	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah?	no
29300	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Hmm.	no
29301	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah, it's just - It's not on the net, so it's a little	no
29302	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	What do you mean it's not on the net?	no
29303	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	It's not bad.	no
29304	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Oh because it's - because it's an ACIRI machine? Oh, oh oh.	no
29305	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
29306	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	And	no
29307	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Who	no
29308	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	That	no
29309	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	But	no
29310	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	No, the - the	no
29311	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	running to that back room	no
29312	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So, they actually have to run a wire	no
29313	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
29314	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah, e- again, you know, any one of these things is certainly not a big deal. If there was a person dedicated to doing it they would happen pretty easily but it's - it's - jus- every- ever- everybody - everybody has a - has -	no
29315	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	But Dave has to do all of them.	no
29316	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	But at any rate I think that there's a - there's a	no
29317	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Uh, maybe - maybe after - after tea or something you and I can go down and - and talk to him about it	no
29318	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	How long is David gonna be gone?	no
29319	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Uh, eleven days or something?	no
29320	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Oh my!	no
29321	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah basically tomorrow and all of	no
29322	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	And that's all I have.	yes
29323	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Um -	no
29324	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Let's see. The only oth- thing - other thing I was gonna add was that um -	no
29325	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	uh, I talked briefly to Mari and uh we	no
29326	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	had	no
29327	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	the Friday after next.	no

29329	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	after the next one of	no
29330	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	do next meeting is - is uh to	no
29331	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	put together um, a kind of reasonable list for ourselves of what is it,	no
29332	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	um,	no
29333	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	that	no
29334	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	we've done.	no

29346	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	like around uh two.	no
29347	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So if it could be before that would be be-	no
29348	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	No, no but I - I - I don't need other folks for the meeting. I can do it. A- A- All I'm saying is that	no

29363	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
29364	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	related to	no
29365	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I wondered whether we should	no
29366	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	maybe have um a	no
29367	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	you know, whoever's interested in that	no
29368	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	because I feel that uh	no

29412	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Uh.	no
29413	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah	no

29417	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	You know, I - I've heard some comments about like this. That m-	no
29418	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
29419	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	And we don't have to do it every week. We could do it every	no
29420	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Could we -	no
29421	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right, I was -	no
29422	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Why don't we alternate this meeting every other	no
29423	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Or just alternate the focus.	no
29424	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Tha-	no
29425	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah, so on even weeks have	no
29426	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
29427	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	We could do that, yeah.	no
29428	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
29429	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I - I -	no
29430	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Um.	no

29433	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Oh sor-	no
29434	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	But I do- I don't - I mean a lot of times lately it seems like we don't really have enough for a full meeting on	no
29435	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
29436	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Well, except that we keep going for our full time.	no
29437	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yep.	no
29438	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Well, cuz we get into these other	no
29439	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
29440	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	We feel - We feel obligated to collect more data.	no
29441	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
29442	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
29443	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Ugh.	no

29446	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Why don't we just	no
29447	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	ummh.	no
29448	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	ummh.	no

29454	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
29455	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah that would be good. I mean Andreas and I have	no
29456	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	various talks in the halls and there's lots of	no
29457	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
29458	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	things, you know, details and stuff that would I think people'd be interested in and I'd - you know, where do we go from here kind of things and -	no
29459	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So, it would be good.	no
29460	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah, and you're - you're attending	no
29461	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	probably one of the best -	no
29462	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Bridge.	no
29463	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
29464	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
29465	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
29466	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Uh.	no
29467	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So um.	no
29468	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	O_K?	no
29469	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So - so we could talk a	no
29470	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	No, no that would be for	yes
29471	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Um I jus- So the	no
29472	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	um	no
29473	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I tested the uh - the	no
29474	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	sort of final version of the P_L_P	no
29475	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	configuration	no
29476	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	um on development test data for - for this year's Hub-five test set.	no
29477	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
29478	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	And the	no
29479	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	recognition performance was	no
29480	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	uh Mel Cepstra	no
29481	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mmm.	no
29482	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	For both females and males?	no
29483	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yes.	no
29484	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Oh!	no
29485	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Uh, well i- there was a little bit of a -	no
29486	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	i-	no
29487	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	They - They were - The	no
29488	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
29489	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
29490	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
29491	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	And then the really nice thing was that if - if we combine the two systems we get a one and a half percent	no
29492	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Wow.	no
29493	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Just with ROVER?	no
29494	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	t- With N_best ROVER, which is like our	no
29495	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
29496	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Which u- actually uses the whole N_best list from both systems	no
29497	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So except - I mean the only key difference between the two really is the kind of smoothing at the end which is the	no
29498	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	auto-regressive versus the	no
29499	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
29500	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	cepstral truncation.	no
29501	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	And, the -	no
29502	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	But a percent and a half? That's -	no
29503	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah, it's pretty	no
29504	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	And - And so uh after I told the - my uh colleagues at S_R_I about that, you know,	no
29505	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	now they definitely want to, you know, uh, have a - Next time we have an evaluation they want to do uh, you know, basically a- at least the system combination.	no
29506	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Um, and, you know, why not? Uh.	no
29507	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Sure, why not?	no
29508	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	We clearly gotta add a few more features, though.	no
29509	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Uh w- what do you mean? More features in the sense of front-end features or in the sense of just bells and whistles?	no
29510	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	No, uh front-end features.	no
29511	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	You know we did P_L_P and Mel Cepstra. Let's, you know, try RASTA and M_S_G, and -	no
29512	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Oh I mean - Yeah. Well	no
29513	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	the - There's	no
29514	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Oh.	no
29515	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	systems and - Um. So.	no
29516	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
29517	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So one - one	no
29518	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	compromise would be to -	no
29519	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	only	no
29520	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	to have the - everything up to the point where you generate lattices be basically one system and then	no
29521	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	after that you rescore your lattices with the multiple systems and combine the results and that's a fairly painless um thing. So.	no
29522	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mmm.	no
29523	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	An-	no
29524	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Do you think we'd still get the one and a half uh -	no
29525	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I - I think so. Yeah. Maybe a little less because at that point the error rates are lower and so if - You know, maybe it's only	no
29526	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
29527	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So.	no
29528	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Um	no
29529	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Cool.	no
29530	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	And then we had some results on	no
29531	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	with um - We - We - So this was uh	no
29532	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	experiments. And so,	no
29533	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
29534	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	uh. But as a	no
29535	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Hub-five system doing so well on the	no
29536	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
29537	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
29538	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Including digits I gather, yeah.	no
29539	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	And - Not all of - No it's actually, digits is only a maybe a fifth of it. The rest is - is read - is read TIMIT data and uh ATIS data and Wall Street Journal and stuff like that.	no
29540	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	A fifth of it is how much?	no
29541	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right. But a fi- a fifth is how much?	no
29542	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	A fifth would be maybe	no
29543	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	uh two hours something.	no
29544	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah, so I mean that's actually not that different from the	no
29545	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
29546	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	But it definitely helps to have the	no
29547	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Oh yeah	no
29548	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	You know the error rate is	no
29549	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
29550	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
29551	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I don't know.	no
29552	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So.	no
29553	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Uh, more read speech data definitely	no
29554	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah	no
29555	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
29556	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Well is there even	no
29557	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Oh, yeah. So we only - for the Hub-five training, we're only using uh a fairly small subset of the	no
29558	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
29559	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Um, so, you could beef that up and probably do even	no
29560	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I could also put in	no
29561	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
29562	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	focus condition zero from Hub-four	no
29563	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	from Broadcast News,	no
29564	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	which is mostly prepared speech.	no
29565	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	It's not exactly	no
29566	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
29567	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
29568	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
29569	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Well, I mean that's	no
29570	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
29571	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	That's right.	no
29572	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	But um.	no
29573	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So, you know that might be useful for the people who train the - the digit recognizers to - to use uh something other than T_I-digits.	no
29574	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
29575	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Well they been using TIMIT.	no
29576	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	O_K.	no
29577	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	That - Uh.	no
29578	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
29579	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	um, - and actually the	no
29580	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Hmm.	no
29581	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Uh -	no
29582	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	But uh - which - So that's what they're - they're using now. But - but yeah certainly if we,	no
29583	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mmm.	no
29584	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	um -	no
29585	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	If we knew what the	no
29586	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
29587	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
29588	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Once we	no
29589	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	lots of - lots of stuff through.	yes
29590	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	lots of - lots of stuff through.	no
29591	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
29592	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
29593	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Well, that was that. And then I th- guess Chuck and I had some discussions about how to proceed with the tandem	no
29594	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	uh system and -	no
29595	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	You wanna -	no
29596	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Well, I'm - Yeah, so Andreas uh brought over the uh alignments that the S_R_I system uses. And so I'm in the process of um	no
29597	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	converting those alignments into uh label files that we can use to train	no
29598	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	uh a new net with. And uh so then I'll train the net. And.	no
29599	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	An- And one side effect of that would be that it's - um that the phone set would change. So the M_L_P would be trained on I think only forty-six or forty-eight - forty-eight phones?	no
29600	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
29601	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Eight.	no
29602	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
29603	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Uh which is smaller than the um	no
29604	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	than the phone set that - that we've been using so far.	no
29605	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
29606	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	And that - that -	no
29607	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So it's a little different?	no
29608	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	um the fewer dimensions uh e- the less trouble probably with the - as far as just the um,	no
29609	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	um -	no
29610	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Just - You know we want to try things like	no
29611	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	fewer dimensions in the	no
29612	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Sure. Although we - I mean, it's not	no
29613	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
29614	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Exactly. So - so that was the	no
29615	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	uh something on the same order of dimensions as we use in a standard um	no
29616	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	that would mean	no
29617	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah, and I think - and we sh- again check - we should check with Stephane. My impression was that when we did that before that had very little - uh he didn't lose very much.	no
29618	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	dimensions.	no
29619	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
29620	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	By just taking the top whatever?	no
29621	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yep.	no
29622	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah	no
29623	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	But then - And then	no
29624	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	uh one thing I wanted to try just for the fun of it was to actually run uh like a standard hybrid system that is based on	no
29625	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	you know, those features uh and uh retrain M_L_P and also the	no
29626	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	you know, the	no
29627	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	And the b- And the base u- starting off with the base of the alignments that you got from i- from a pretty decent system.	no
29628	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Exactly.	no
29629	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
29630	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah. So	no
29631	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	that would basically give us a, um, more -	no
29632	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	better	no
29633	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	um because - you know, compared to what Eric did a while ago, where he trained up, I think, a system based on Broadcast News and then	no
29634	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	uh tra- retraining it on	no
29635	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
29636	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	But he - I think he d- he didn't -	no
29637	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	he probably didn't use	no
29638	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	that was available. And his dictionary probably wasn't as tuned to um	no
29639	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	conversational speech as - as the -	no
29640	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	as	no
29641	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	That's - That's certainly	no
29642	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	And the	no
29643	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
29644	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	improvements to the dictionary's uh - to the dictionary about two years ago which resulted in a -	no
29645	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	uh something like a four percent absolute	no
29646	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	error rate reduction on Switchboard, which -	no
29647	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Well the	no
29648	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
29649	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	when we were collaborating with S_R_I	no
29650	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mmm. Mm-hmm.	no
29651	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	it was - I	no
29652	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	uh	no
29653	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
29654	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	uh	no
29655	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
29656	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
29657	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
29658	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	then it was - it was typically better to use our	no
29659	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	trying to recover from our initial hundred and forty percent error uh rate. Uh.	no
29660	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
29661	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	O_K.	no
29662	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
29663	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	W- What	no
29664	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
29665	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Roughly?	no
29666	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Well, the	no
29667	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	fix up the dictionary.	no
29668	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Uh we always had a list of a half dozen things that we were gonna do and - and a lot of them were pretty simple and we never did.	no
29669	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
29670	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mmm.	no
29671	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	But that w- Even	no
29672	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Uh, we never did an- never did any adaptation	no
29673	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
29674	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	And - And	no
29675	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Where the error rate now is in the	no
29676	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So, um.	no
29677	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah. Yeah.	no
29678	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So we were - Yeah. We were	no
29679	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	That's yet s-	no
29680	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	probably at least a factor or two off.	no
29681	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
29682	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
29683	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So it would be - So it would be good t- to sort of r- re- uh - just at least to give us an idea of how well the hybrid system would do.	no
29684	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
29685	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
29686	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	But I think - again it's -	no
29687	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah. It's the conver- it's the s-	no
29688	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	conversational speech bit.	no
29689	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Because our - our Broadcast News system is actually pretty good.	no
29690	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
29691	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
29692	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	And the	no
29693	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Because it's a pretty good um	no
29694	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
29695	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	indicator of that.	no
29696	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	uh you know, use them as a basis for the tandem system.	no
29697	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
29698	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah. It'll	no
29699	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	No.	no
29700	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Sure.	no
29701	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Should we - Should we bother with um using the net	no
29702	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Not - But -	no
29703	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	before doing uh embedded	no
29704	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	training?	no
29705	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I mean should - should we even	no
29706	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Oh	no
29707	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	from the S_R_	no
29708	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Try it.	no
29709	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	You run it? Keep - keep both versions? See which one's better?	no
29710	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Uh, yeah. I mean. I think I agree with Ad-	no
29711	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I mean basically you would then - You	no
29712	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
29713	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
29714	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
29715	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mmm.	no
29716	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Alright.	no
29717	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I could make arguments either way. You know, it's - Sort of given up guessing.	no
29718	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	But - But so I - Well but i- But in your experience I mean uh have you seen	no
29719	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	big improvements in s- on some tasks with embedded training? Or was it sort of small-ish uh improvements that you got-	no
29720	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Uh well. It depended on the task. I mean I think in this one I would sort of expect it to be important because we're coming from	no
29721	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
29722	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	uh, alignments that were achieved with an	no
29723	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	That are from another -	no
29724	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
29725	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
29726	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Although,	no
29727	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Uh.	no
29728	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I mean we've done it with - When we were combining with the Cambridge	no
29729	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Which I've never figured out.	no
29730	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right. But I mean i-	no
29731	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I think it's a bug.	no
29732	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So you - you started training with outputs from a - with alignments that were generated by the Cambridge uh system?	no
29733	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yep.	no
29734	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	And then -	no
29735	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Uh. Hmm.	no
29736	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
29737	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
29738	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Well, that might probably just - Hmm. That was	no
29739	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	And you -	no
29740	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Um.	no
29741	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Was it? I don't think it was.	no
29742	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	No they were - they were comparable.	no
29743	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	It wasn't?	no
29744	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	No.	no
29745	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Really?	no
29746	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	They were very close.	no
29747	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
29748	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Excuse me?	no
29749	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	That's - That's	no
29750	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Oh!	no
29751	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	No I mean it's weird that it did - I'm sorry. It's w-	no
29752	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Um. No. Uh.	no
29753	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Tha- u- we- we've see- I mean - and wi- with the numbers - O_G_I numbers task we've seen a number of times people doing embedded trainings and things not getting better.	no
29754	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Oh actually it's not	no
29755	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	We have seen cases where acoustic - retraining the acoustic models after some other change made matters worse rather than better.	no
29756	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah. It just -	no
29757	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
29758	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	But I- But I would - I would	no
29759	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Um	no
29760	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	feature set, for instance - I mean they were using pretty diff- similar feature sets to us.	no
29761	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yep.	no
29762	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I - I would expect that something that had a different feature set would - would uh benefit from -	no
29763	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
29764	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	What about uh	no
29765	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Oh, wait a minute, and the other thing uh, sorry, it was - the other thing is that what was in	no
29766	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	to the Cambridge system and our system is they	no
29767	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
29768	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So I mean, uh,	no
29769	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	uh, one bac- at least -	no
29770	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Back at -	no
29771	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	You mean with soft targets?	no
29772	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Or - ?	no
29773	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Sorry, I'm sor- I missed - What - What's the key issue here?	no
29774	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Oh, that uh	no
29775	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	both the Cambridge system and our system were - were training	no
29776	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So - so that's	no
29777	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
29778	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	different - different uh, um,	no
29779	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	training criterion -	no
29780	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Uh, I would	no
29781	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	training would have at least a good shot of improving it some more. But we don't know.	no
29782	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
29783	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	O_K.	no
29784	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	You gonna say something?	no
29785	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah. I was wondering uh you know what	no
29786	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	size net I should -	no
29787	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Anybody have any intuitions or suggestions?	no
29788	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Uh, how much training data?	no
29789	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Well, I was gonna start off with the	no
29790	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	And how - How many hours is that?	no
29791	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	That's why I was - I - I'm not sure how much that is.	no
29792	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Uh, I think that has about -	no
29793	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Well i- you'd - would be gender-dependent training, right? So - So I think it's - uh that's about	no
29794	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Gender-dependent, yeah.	no
29795	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	mmm, something like thirty hours.	no
29796	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Thirty hours.	no
29797	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Thirty hours per gender.	no
29798	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I'm not sure what	no
29799	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	In the small training set?	no
29800	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I - I	no
29801	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Hello?	no
29802	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Excuse me?	no
29803	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	It's definitely less than a hundred - You know, it's more like -	no
29804	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Alright.	no
29805	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	like thirty forty hours something like that.	no
29806	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Wrong number.	no
29807	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	They called to tell us that?	no
29808	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
29809	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
29810	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Um. So. Uh.	no
29811	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I mean, I	no
29812	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right. So	no

30114	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	O_ three seven eight.	no
30115	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So uh, you see, Don, the unbridled excitement of the work that we have on this project.	no
30116	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	O_K.	no
30117	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Umh.	no
30118	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh,	no
30119	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	you know, it doesn't seem like a bad idea to have	no
30120	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And I'm surprised I sort of - I'm surprised I	no
30121	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, I - I'd - I think it's	no
30122	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	After I just printed out a zillion of them.	no
30123	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, well, that's -	no
30124	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Um, so I - I do have a - a- an agenda suggestion.	no
30125	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh, we - I think the things that we talk about in this meeting	no
30126	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh tend to be a mixture of uh procedural uh mundane things and uh research points	no
30127	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	and um I was	no
30128	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I think it was a meeting a couple of weeks ago that we -	no
30129	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	we spent much of the time talking about the mundane stuff cuz that's easier to get out of the way and then we sort of drifted into the research and maybe five minutes into that Andreas had to leave.	no
30130	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So	no
30131	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	mundane points that we could send an email later, uh hold them for a bit, and let's talk about the - the research-y kind of things.	no
30132	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Um, so um	no
30133	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	the one th- one thing I	no
30134	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh about the uh - the stuff you were doing with - with uh	no
30135	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	um uh l- l- attempting to locate events,	no
30136	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	"we had a little go around trying to figure out what you meant by """	no
30137	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I think, you know, what	no
30138	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	points of overlap between speakers.	no
30139	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	But I th- I gather from our discussion a little earlier today that you	no
30140	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh interruptions with something	no
30141	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30142	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yes?	no
30143	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh-huh. Yeah.	no
30144	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	You mean that as an event also.	no
30145	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So	no
30146	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	To- right.	no
30147	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	then the other thing would be it might be nice to have a preliminary discussion of some of the other uh research	no
30148	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh areas that uh we're thinking about doing.	no
30149	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Um, I think	no
30150	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	especially since you - you haven't been in - in these meetings for a little bit, maybe you have some discussion of some of the p- the plausible things to look at now that we're starting to get data,	no
30151	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh and	no
30152	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh about some - some - some um uh work about	no
30153	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I - I - I d- I - I don't want to try to say cuz I -	no
30154	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I'll say it wrong,	no
30155	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	but anyway some - some potential collaboration there about - about the - about the - working with these data.	no
30156	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Oh. Sure.	no
30157	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So.	no
30158	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30159	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So, uh.	no
30160	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	You wanna just go around?	no
30161	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh.	no
30162	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh, wh- why don't -	no
30163	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Actually I think that - that last one I just said we could do fairly quickly so why don't you - you start with that.	yes
30164	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Actually I think that - that last one I just said we could do fairly quickly so why don't you - you start with that.	no
30165	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	O_K. Shall I - shall I just start? O_K.	no
30166	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, just explain what it was.	no
30167	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Um, so, uh, he was interested in the question of - you know, relating to his - to the research he presented recently,	no
30168	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	um of inference structures, and uh, the need to build in, um,	no
30169	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	this - this sort of uh mechanism for understanding of language. And he gave the example in his talk about how	no
30170	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	"i- ""Joe slipped"" you know, ""John had washed the floor"" or something like that."	no
30171	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And I don't have it quite right, but that kind of thing, where you have to draw the inference that, O_K, there's this time sequence,	no
30172	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	but	no
30173	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	um it was the other person who fell than the one who cleaned it and it -	no
30174	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I looked through the transcript that we have so far,	no
30175	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	um, w- we had gone through the part where everyone said which channel they were on and which device they were on,	no
30176	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	and um, the question was raised	no
30177	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	"""Well, should we restart the recording at this point?"""	no
30178	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	"And - and Dan Ellis said, ""Well, we're just so far ahead of the"	no
30179	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	"Now, how would you interpret that without a lot of inference? So, the inferences that are involved are things like, O_K, so, how do you interpret ""ahead of the game""?"	no
30180	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	You know.	no
30181	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So it's the - it's	no
30182	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Hmm, metaphorically.	no
30183	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	i-	no
30184	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	What you - what you int- what you draw - you know, the conclusions that you need to draw are that space is involved in recording,	no
30185	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	that um, i- that	no
30186	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	"and he continues, like ""we're so ahead of the game cuz now we have built-in downsampling""."	no
30187	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So you have to sort of get the idea that	no
30188	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	"um, ""ahead of the game"" is sp- speaking with respect to space limitations, that um that in fact downsampling is gaining us enough space, and that therefore we can keep the recording we've done so far."	no
30189	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	But there are a lot of different things like that.	no
30190	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So, do you think his interest is in using this as	no
30191	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well, I - I should maybe interject to say this started off with a discussion that I had with him, so	no
30192	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	um we were trying to think of ways that	no
30193	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
30194	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh I thought that if we were going to project into the future when we had a lot of data,	no
30195	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh and um such things might be	no
30196	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	in or- before we invested too much uh effort into that he should uh, with Jane's help, look	no
30197	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	into some of the data that we're - already	no
30198	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
30199	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	and see, is there	no
30200	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Is there any point which you think that, you know, you could gain some advantage and some potential use for it. Cuz it	no
30201	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Wrong, yeah.	no
30202	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And - and uh I	no
30203	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	It's possible. Uh, he was - he - he - you know - We met and he was gonna go and uh you know, y- look through them more systematically and then uh meet	no
30204	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30205	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30206	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30207	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	But, yeah, I think -	no
30208	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I think it was optimistic.	no
30209	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So	no
30210	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	But he can use text, basically.	no
30211	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I mean, he's talking about just using text	no
30212	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	That's his major -	no
30213	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I mentioned several that w- had to do with implications drawn from intonational contours and	no
30214	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	O_K.	no
30215	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	He's interested in these - these knowledge structures, inferences that you draw	no
30216	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, interesting.	no
30217	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I mean, he certainly could use text, but we were in fact looking to see if there - is there - is there something in common between our interest in meetings and his interest in - in - in this stuff. So.	no
30218	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And I imagine that transcripts of speech - I mean text that is speech - probably has more of those than sort of prepared writing. I - I don't know whether it would or not, but it	no
30219	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I don't know, probably de- probably depends on what the prepared writing was. But.	no
30220	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, I don't think I would make that leap, because i- in narratives, you know - I mean, if you spell out everything in a narrative, it can be really tedious, so.	no
30221	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
30222	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, I'm just thinking, you know, when you're - when you're face to face, you have a lot of backchannel and -	no
30223	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And -	no
30224	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah. And so I think it's just easier to do that sort of broad inference jumping	no
30225	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	if it's face to face.	no
30226	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well -	no
30227	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	"I mean, so, if I just read that Dan was saying ""we're ahead of the game"""	no
30228	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30229	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I might not	no
30230	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	"I - you know, I - I had several that had to do with backchannels and this wasn't one of them. This - this one really does um m- make you leap from - So he said, you know, ""we're ahead of the game, w- we have built-in downsampling""."	no
30231	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh-huh.	no
30232	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
30233	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And the inference, i- if you had it written down, would be -	no
30234	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I guess it would be the same.	no
30235	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh-huh. But there are others that have backchanneling, it's just he was less interested in those.	no
30236	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Can I -	no
30237	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Sorry to interrupt. Um,	no
30238	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I f- f- f- I've -	no
30239	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	A minute - uh, several minutes ago, I, like, briefly was - was not listening and -	no
30240	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	"So who is """	no
30241	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, there's a lot of pronoun -	no
30242	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	O_K.	no
30243	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	"So I was just realizing we've - You guys have been talking about ""he"" um"	no
30244	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	for at least uh, I don't know, three -	no
30245	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	three four minutes without ever mentioning the person's	no
30246	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30247	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So this is - this is -	no
30248	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Actually to make it	no
30249	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	It's in my notes.	no
30250	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	this is - gonna be a big, big problem if you want to	no
30251	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	"uh, Morgan uses ""you"" and ""you"""	no
30252	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	speech understanding of	no
30253	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I just wrote this down.	no
30254	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	You just wrote this?	no
30255	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30256	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well, I think he's doing that	no
30257	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right, so it's great. So this is really great because the	no
30258	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right.	no
30259	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30260	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
30261	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh-huh. Could be. Yeah. That would be tou-	no
30262	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Can we-	no
30263	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Oh,	no
30264	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30265	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, so that, I mean, to even know um when -	no
30266	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, if you have the P_Z_Ms you should be able to pick up	no
30267	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	what a person is looking at	no
30268	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	from their voice.	no
30269	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well,	no
30270	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right. Put Morgan always like this and -	no
30271	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh.	no
30272	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Oh, but you'd have the -	no
30273	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	You'd have fainter - Wouldn't you get fainter reception out here?	no
30274	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well, these -	no
30275	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Sure, but I think if I'm talking like	no
30276	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right now I'm looking at	no
30277	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	But you don't have this - this problem.	no
30278	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I see.	no
30279	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So if I'm talking at	no
30280	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	"I probably been affect- No, I th- I think I've been affected by too many conversations where we were talking about lawyers and talking about - and concerns about ""oh gee is somebody going to say something bad?"" and so on."	no
30281	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Lawyers.	no
30282	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And so I - so I'm - I'm tending to stay away from people's names even though uh -	no
30283	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I am too.	no
30284	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Even though you	no
30285	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I am too.	no
30286	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And we	no
30287	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30288	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Early in the conversation.	no
30289	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30290	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right, but I missed it. But - it was uh -	no
30291	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Do - Sh- Can I say or - or is that just too sensitive?	no
30292	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, yeah.	no
30293	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah. Yeah. No no, there's - No no, it isn't sensitive at all. I was just -	no
30294	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30295	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I was just - I was overreacting just because we've been talking about it. It's O_K to -	no
30296	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And in fact, it	no
30297	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	No, but that - it's interesting.	no
30298	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	mention. I mean, it fits into the m- area of the mundane, but they	no
30299	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	"You know, I asked her very specifically about this clause of how, um, you know, it says ""no individuals will be identified"	no

30303	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	b- But I -	no
30304	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Then the issue of - of being able to trace Joe, because we know he's well-known in this field, and all this and - and tie it to the speaker,	no
30305	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	whose name was just mentioned a moment ago, can be sensitive. So I think it's really - really kind of adaptive and wise to not mention names any more than we have to because if there's a slanderous aspect to it, then how much to we wanna be able to have to remove?	no
30306	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, well, there's that.	no
30307	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	But I - I mean I think also to some extent it's just educating the Human Subjects people, in a	no
30308	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	If uh - You know, there's court transcripts, there's - there's transcripts of radio shows -	no

30311	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	then there's no chance of - of - of slandering anybody, but -	no
30312	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	But, then it won't - I mean, if we - if we - Yeah. I mean we should do whatever's natural in a meeting if - if we weren't being recorded.	no
30313	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	It's not a meeting.	no
30314	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no

30318	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30319	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well, if you ha- since you have to um	no
30320	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	go over the transcripts later	no
30321	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	jobs of the	no
30322	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well, we t- we t- we	no

30324	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	audio and the written every time someone says a name.	no
30325	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And I thought that our conclusion was that we didn't want to do that.	no
30326	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, we really can't. But a- actually, I'm sorry. I really would like to push - finish this off. So it's -	no
30327	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I understand. No I just - I just was suggesting that it's not a bad policy p- potentially. So, we need to talk about this later.	no
30328	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, I di- I didn't	no
30329	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	It was - it was just it was just unconscious - well, semi-conscious behavior. I sorta knew I was doing it but it was -	no

30333	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Ah. Uh, we were talking about Dan at one point	no
30334	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Oh.	no
30335	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, depends on which one you mean.	no
30336	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	It's ambiguous, so it's O_K.	no
30337	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh, I think -	no
30338	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well, the inference structures was Lokendra.	no
30339	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	But no. The inference stuff was - was - was Lokendra. O_K. That makes sense, yeah.	no
30340	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.	no
30341	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And the downsampling must have been Dan.	no

30346	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30347	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Um, I - I would like to move it into - into uh what Jose uh has been doing because he's actually been doing something. So.	no
30348	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30349	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh-huh.	no
30350	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	O_K.	no
30351	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	As opposed to the	no
30352	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right.	no
30353	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	O_K. I - I remind that me - my first objective eh, in the project is to - to study difference parameters to - to find a - a good solution to detect eh, the overlapping zone in eh speech recorded.	no
30354	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	But eh,	no
30355	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	In that way	no
30356	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I -	no
30357	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I begin to - to study and to analyze the ehn - the recorded speech eh the different session to - to find and to locate and to mark eh the - the different overlapping zone.	no
30358	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And eh so eh I was eh - I am transcribing the - the first session and I - I have found eh, eh one thousand acoustic events,	no
30359	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	eh	no
30360	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	eh I - I - I mean the eh breaths eh aspiration eh, eh,	no
30361	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I don't know what is the different names eh you use to - to name the - the	no
30362	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Nonspeech sounds?	no
30363	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	speech	no
30364	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30365	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Oh, I don't think we've been doing it at that level of detail.	no
30366	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So.	no
30367	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30368	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Eh,	no
30369	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	to label the - the different acoustic, but I prefer because eh	no
30370	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I would like to - to study if eh, I -	no
30371	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I will find eh, eh, a good eh parameters eh to detect overlapping I would like to - to - to test these parameters eh with the - another eh, eh acoustic events,	no
30372	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	to nnn -	no
30373	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
30374	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	You know -	no
30375	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So it was -	no
30376	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I think some of these um that are the nonspeech overlapping events	no
30377	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Umh.	no
30378	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	may be difficult even for	no
30379	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30380	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I mean, if it's a tapping sound, you wouldn't necessarily - or, you know, something like that, it'd be - it might be hard to know that it was two separate events.	no
30381	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30382	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30383	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30384	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30385	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well -	no
30386	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	You weren't talking about just	no
30387	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I - I - I - I t- I t-	no
30388	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Someone starts, someone stops -	no
30389	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I talk eh about eh acoustic events in general,	no
30390	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30391	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	but eh my - my objective eh will be eh to study eh overlapping zone.	no
30392	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Oh.	no
30393	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
30394	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Eh?	no
30395	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	How many overlaps were there uh in it?	no
30396	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	n-	no
30397	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Eh in twelve minutes I found eh, eh one thousand acoustic events.	no
30398	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	No no, how	no
30399	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	How many? Eh almost eh three hundred eh in one session in five - eh in forty-five minutes.	no
30400	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Oh, God!	no
30401	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Ugh.	no
30402	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Three hundred overlapping speech -	no
30403	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Alm- Three	no
30404	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Overlapping speech.	no
30405	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	With the overlapping zone, overlapping speech - speech what eh different duration.	no
30406	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Sure.	no
30407	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
30408	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Does this - ? So if you had an overlap involving three people, how many times was that counted?	no
30409	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, three people, two people. Eh, um I would like to consider eh one people with difference noise eh in the background, be-	no
30410	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	No no, but I think what she's asking is	no
30411	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Oh.	no
30412	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Oh.	no
30413	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30414	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I consider one event eh for th- for that eh for	no
30415	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	This - th-	no
30416	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well -	no
30417	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I - I - I con- I consider - I consider eh an acoustic event, the overlapping zone, the period where three speaker or eh - are talking together.	no
30418	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So let's -	no
30419	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	For-	no
30420	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Umh.	no
30421	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So let's say me and Jane are talking at the same time, and then Liz starts talking	no
30422	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So- I don't understand.	no
30423	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So,	no
30424	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah?	no
30425	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	and then a	no
30426	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Hmm.	no
30427	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Eh no.	no
30428	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	No no.	no
30429	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	For me is the overlapping zone, because -	no
30430	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So i- if two or more people are talking.	no
30431	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I see.	no
30432	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	because you - you have s- you have more one - eh,	no
30433	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	more one voice eh, eh produced in a - in - in a moment.	no
30434	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	O_K.	no
30435	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah. So I think - Yeah. We just wanted to understand how you're defining it. So then,	no
30436	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30437	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	If-	no
30438	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	in the region between - since there - there is some continuous region,	no
30439	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	in	no
30440	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh-huh.	no
30441	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh-huh. Yeah.	no
30442	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Is it - Are you calling the	no
30443	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I consider the - the, nnn - the nnn, nnn - eh, the	no
30444	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	eh, all - all the time there were - the voice has overlapped.	no
30445	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	O_K.	no
30446	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	This is the idea.	no
30447	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	But eh I - I don't	no
30448	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh, I'm not considering	no
30449	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	eh, the fact of eh, eh, for example, what did you say?	no
30450	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Eh at first eh, eh two talkers are uh, eh speaking,	no
30451	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	and eh, eh a third person eh join to - to that.	no
30452	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	For me, it's eh - it's eh, all overlap zone,	no
30453	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	with eh several numbers of speakers is eh, eh the same acoustic event.	no
30454	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Wi- but - uh, without any mark between the zone -	no
30455	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	of the overlapping zone with two speakers eh speaking together,	no
30456	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	and the zone with the three speakers. It -	no
30457	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	That would j- just be one.	no
30458	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	One. One.	no
30459	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	O_K.	no
30460	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Eh, with eh, a beginning mark and the ending mark.	no
30461	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Got it.	no
30462	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Because eh	no
30463	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	is the zone with eh some kind of eh distortion the spectral. I don't mind - By the	no
30464	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well, but -	no
30465	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	But you could imagine that three people talking has a different spectral characteristic than	no
30466	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, but eh - but eh I have to study.	no
30467	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	You had to start somewhere.	no
30468	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30469	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	What will	no
30470	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	We just w-	no
30471	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So there's a lot of overlap. So.	no
30472	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yep.	no
30473	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I don't	no
30474	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	That's a lot of overlap, yeah, for forty-five minutes.	no
30475	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So again, that's - that's three - three hundred in forty-five minutes that are - that are	no
30476	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30477	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30478	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	But a - a - a th-	no
30479	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh-	no
30480	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30481	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah,	no
30482	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	But a thousand events in twelve minutes, that's -	no
30483	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30484	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh.	no
30485	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	But that can include taps.	no
30486	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	But -	no
30487	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well, but a thousand	no
30488	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30489	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Actually -	no
30490	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I - I con- I consider -	no
30491	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I consider acoustic events eh, the silent too.	no
30492	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Silent.	no
30493	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Silence starting or silence ending -	no
30494	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, silent,	no
30495	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	to detect - eh because I consider acoustic event all the things are not eh speech.	no
30496	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Oh, O_K.	no
30497	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
30498	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	In ge- in - in - in a general point of view.	no
30499	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Oh.	no
30500	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	O_K, so how many of those thousand were silence?	no
30501	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Alright.	no
30502	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	in the per-	no
30503	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right.	no
30504	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So how many of those thousand were silence, silent sections?	no
30505	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30506	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh silent, I - I - I -	no
30507	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I don't - I - I	no
30508	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	eh I - I would like to - to do a stylistic	no
30509	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	study and give you	no
30510	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30511	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	eh with the report eh from eh	no
30512	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30513	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30514	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	the - the study from the -	no
30515	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	the - the session -	no
30516	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And I - I found that eh another thing.	no
30517	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	When eh	no
30518	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I was eh look at eh nnn, the difference speech file,	no
30519	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	um, for example, eh if eh we use the ehm - the mixed file, to - to transcribe,	no
30520	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	the - the events and the words,	no
30521	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I - I saw that eh the eh speech signal, collected by the eh this kind of mike - eh of this kind of mike,	no
30522	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	eh are different	no
30523	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yep.	no
30524	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	from the eh mixed signal	no
30525	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	eh, we eh - collected by headphone. And -	no
30526	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right.	no
30527	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30528	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	It's right. But the problem is	no
30529	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	The - the - the -	no
30530	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I - I - I knew that eh the signal eh, eh would be different, but eh	no
30531	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	the - the problem is eh, eh we eh detected eh difference events in the speech file eh collected by - by that mike	no
30532	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh qui- compared with the mixed file.	no
30533	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well -	no
30534	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And so if - when you transcribe eh only eh using the nnn - the mixed file,	no
30535	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	it's possible - eh if you use the transcription	no
30536	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	to evaluate a different system,	no
30537	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	it's possible you	no
30538	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	eh - in the eh i-	no
30539	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	and you use the eh speech file collected by the eh	no
30540	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	to eh - to nnn -	no
30541	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	to do the experiments	no
30542	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
30543	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right.	no
30544	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	its possible to evaluate eh, eh - or to consider eh acoustic events that -	no
30545	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	which you marked eh in the mixed file,	no
30546	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	but eh they don't appear in the eh speech signal eh collected by the - by the mike.	no
30547	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right.	no
30548	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	The - the reason that I generated the mixed file was for	no
30549	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I_B_M to do	no
30550	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30551	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah. Oh, it's a good idea. It's a good idea I think.	no
30552	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So I agree that if someone wants to do	no
30553	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30554	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	the mixed signals here - I mean, if I'm tapping on the	no
30555	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30556	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	but it's gonna show up	no
30557	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30558	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30559	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So and I - I -	no
30560	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	eh, or this eh only because eh I c- I - I -	no
30561	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	it's necessary to eh - to eh - to put the transcription on the speech file,	no
30562	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	collected by the objective signal.	no
30563	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I mean the - the - the signal collected by the -	no
30564	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
30565	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	eh, the real mike in the future, in the prototype	no
30566	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
30567	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	The - the - the far-field, yeah.	no
30568	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	to - to eh correct	no
30569	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	the initial eh segmentation	no
30570	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	eh with the eh real speech you have to - to analyze - you have to - to process.	no
30571	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Because I - I found a difference.	no
30572	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, well, just - I mean, just in that - that one s-	no
30573	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
30574	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	ten second, or whatever it was, example that Adam had that - that we - we passed on to others a few months ago,	no
30575	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	there was that business where I g- I guess it was Adam and Jane were talking at the same time and -	no
30576	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
30577	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	and uh,	no
30578	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	in the close-talking mikes you couldn't hear the overlap,	no
30579	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	and in the distant mike you	no
30580	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	yeah, it's clear that if you wanna study -	no
30581	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	That's	no
30582	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	if you wanna find all the places where there were overlap, it's probably better to use a distant mike. On the other hand,	no
30583	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	there's	no
30584	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30585	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	But	no
30586	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	If you use the combination of the close-talking mikes, you	no
30587	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And so if you're interested in -	no
30588	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Some	no
30589	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I - I mean if you're interested in speakers overlapping other speakers and not the other kinds of nonspeech, that's not a problem, right?	no
30590	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30591	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right.	no
30592	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right.	no
30593	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30594	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Although the	no
30595	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30596	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	But it's known. I mean, the normalization you do is over the whole conversation isn't it, over the whole meeting.	no
30597	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yep.	no
30598	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right.	no
30599	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yep.	no
30600	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So if you wanted to study people overlapping people, that's not a problem.	no
30601	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30602	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right.	no
30603	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I - I - I think eh	no
30604	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	eh but eh I eh - I have eh any results.	no
30605	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I - I - I saw the - the speech file collected by eh the	no
30606	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	and eh eh signal eh to eh - to noise eh relation is eh low.	no
30607	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
30608	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	It's low. It's very low. You would comp- if we compare it with eh the headphone. And	no
30609	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yep.	no
30610	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I - I found that nnn - that eh,	no
30611	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Did - Did you k-	no
30612	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	pr-	no
30613	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I'm not sure eh by the moment, but it's - it's	no
30614	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	a lot of eh,	no
30615	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	on eh - in - in several eh parts of the files	no
30616	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	where you - you can find eh, eh	no
30617	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.	no
30618	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	in the - in the meeting,	no
30619	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	it's probably in - in that eh -	no
30620	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	in - in those files you - you can not find - you can not process because eh it's confused with - with noise.	no
30621	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
30622	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And there are	no
30623	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	But eh my idea is to - to process only	no
30624	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Because I think it's more realistic. I'm not sure it's a good idea, but eh -	no
30625	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	No - i-	no
30626	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well, it's more realistic but it'll - it'll be a lot harder.	no
30627	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well, it'd be hard, but on the other hand as you point out, if your - if i-	no
30628	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	if - if your concern is to get uh the overlapping people - people's speech, you will - you will get that somewhat better. Um,	no
30629	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm. Yeah.	no
30630	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Are you making any use - uh you were - you were working with th- the data that had already been	no
30631	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	With - By Jane.	no
30632	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Does it uh -	no
30633	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yes. Now um did you make any	no
30634	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30635	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	See I was wondering cuz we st- we have these ten hours of other stuff that is not yet transcribed. Do you -	no
30636	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30637	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30638	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	The - the transcription by Jane, t- eh i- eh,	no
30639	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I - I - I want to use to - to nnn,	no
30640	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	to put - i- i- it's a reference for me.	no
30641	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	But eh the transcription -	no
30642	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	eh for example, I - I don't - I - I'm not interested in the - in the - in the words,	no
30643	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	transcription words, eh	no
30644	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	transcribed eh eh in -	no
30645	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	eh follow in the -	no
30646	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	but eh eh Jane eh for example eh put a mark eh at the beginning eh of each eh talker,	no
30647	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	in the - in the meeting,	no
30648	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	um eh she - she nnn includes information	no
30649	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	about the zone where eh there are eh - there is an overlapping zone.	no
30650	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
30651	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	But eh there isn't any - any mark,	no
30652	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	time - temporal mark,	no
30653	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	to - to c- eh - to mmm	no
30654	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	O_K.	no
30655	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	the beginning and the end of the - of the ta-	no
30656	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right, so she is -	no
30657	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I'm - I - I - I think eh we need this information to nnn -	no
30658	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right.	no
30659	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So the twelve - you - you - it took you twelve hours -	no
30660	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	of course this included maybe some - some time where you were learning about what - what you wanted to do, but -	no
30661	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	but uh, it took you something like twelve hours to mark the forty-five minutes, your s-	no
30662	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Twelve minutes.	no
30663	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Twelve minutes. Twelve.	no
30664	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I thought you did forty-five minutes of -	no
30665	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	No, forty-five minutes is the - is the session,	no
30666	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Oh, you haven't done the whole session. This is just twelve minutes.	no
30667	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Oh.	no
30668	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, all is the	no
30669	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Tw- twelve hours of work	no
30670	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	to -	no
30671	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So	no
30672	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	of f-	no
30673	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30674	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	No no no. I - I consider all the - all the session because eh I - I count the nnn - the nnn - the overlappings marked by - by Jane,	no
30675	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Oh, O_K.	no
30676	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	in - in - in - in the	no
30677	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Oh, I see.	no
30678	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So it's three hundred in forty-five minutes, but you have - you have time uh, uh marked -	no
30679	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	twelve minute - the - the - the um overlaps in twelve minutes of it. Got it.	no
30680	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30681	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well, not just the overlaps,	no
30682	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So, can I ask -	no
30683	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh Jane's uh	no
30684	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh labels were as far as -	no
30685	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	you know, did she miss some overlaps? or did she n- ?	no
30686	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	But, by - by the moment, I - I don't compare,	no
30687	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	my - my temporal mark with eh Jane, but eh	no
30688	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
30689	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
30690	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I - I want to do it.	no
30691	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Because eh eh i- per- perhaps	no
30692	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I have eh errors in the - in the marks,	no
30693	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
30694	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I - and if I - I compare with eh Jane,	no
30695	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30696	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well -	no
30697	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	it's probably	no
30698	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I - I - I can correct	no
30699	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	and - and - and - to get eh eh a more accurately eh eh transcription in the file.	no
30700	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I-	no
30701	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well, also Jane - Jane was doing	no
30702	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30703	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So we weren't	no
30704	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30705	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right. Right. I'm expect- I'm not expecting -	no
30706	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well, not only a word level, but actually I mean, you didn't need to	no
30707	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right.	no
30708	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
30709	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yep.	no
30710	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30711	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30712	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well, yeah, b- yeah, I would say time bin. So my - my goal is to get words with reference to a	no
30713	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30714	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30715	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30716	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right.	no
30717	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30718	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	yeah, w- it just wasn't important for our purposes to have it that - i- disrupt that unit in order to have, you know, a- the words in the order in which they were spoken, it would have -	no
30719	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30720	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	it would have been hard with the interface that we have. Now, my - a- Adam's working on a of course, on a revised overlapping interface, but -	no
30721	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right.	no
30722	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh-huh. I - I - I think -	no
30723	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	It's - it's a good eh work, but eh I think we need eh eh more information.	no
30724	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	No, of	no
30725	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30726	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	No, no. I - I have to go to - I want eh - I wanted to eh compare the - the transcription.	no
30727	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30728	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I have -	no
30729	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	But if it takes sixty to one -	no
30730	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well, I- but I have a suggestion about that. Um,	no
30731	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	obviously this is very, very time-consuming, and you're finding lots of things which I'm sure are gonna be very interesting,	no
30732	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	but in the interests of making progress, uh might I s- how - how would it affect your time if you only marked speaker overlaps?	no
30733	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yes. Do not mark any other events, but only mark speaker -	no
30734	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30735	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh-huh.	no
30736	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	O_K.	no
30737	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	O_K.	no
30738	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Do y- do you think that would speed it up?	no
30739	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh, speed up your - your - your marking?	no
30740	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I - I - I - I w-	no
30741	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I - I wanted to - nnn, I don't understand very.	no
30742	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	It took you a long time	no
30743	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30744	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Oh, yeah, yeah.	no
30745	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	On- only to mark - only to mark overlapping zone, but -	no
30746	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, and my question is, if you did that, if you followed my suggestion, would it take much less time?	no
30747	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Oh, yeah. Sure. Yeah sure.	no
30748	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah O_K.	no
30749	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	because I - I need a lot of time to - to put the label or to do that. Yeah.	no
30750	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, I mean, we- we know that there's noise.	no
30751	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And-	no
30752	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh-huh.	no
30753	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	There's - there's uh continual noise uh from fans and so forth, and there is uh more impulsive noise from uh taps and so forth and - and something in between with paper rustling.	no
30754	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30755	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	We know that all that's there and it's a g- worthwhile thing to study,	no
30756	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
30757	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	but obviously it takes a lot of time to mark all of these things.	no
30758	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30759	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Whereas th- i- I would	no
30760	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh-huh. O_K. O_K.	no
30761	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So.	no
30762	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Then you can get the - Cuz you need - If it's three hundred uh - i- i- it sounds like you probably only have fifty or sixty or seventy	no
30763	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	events right now that are really -	no
30764	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30765	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And - and you need to have a lot	no
30766	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right.	no
30767	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Now, why do you need to mark speaker overlap by	no
30768	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well, that's -	no
30769	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	That's what I was gonna bring up.	no
30770	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Um, O_K, yeah. So let's back up because you weren't here for an earlier conversation.	no
30771	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I'm sorry.	no
30772	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So the idea was that what he was going to be doing was experimenting with different measures such as the increase in energy,	no
30773	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	such as the energy in the L_P_C residuals, such as -	no
30774	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
30775	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I mean, increased energy is -is sort of an obvious one. Yeah. Um, and	no
30776	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	In the	no
30777	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Oh, O_K.	no
30778	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh, it's not obvious, I mean, you could - you could do the dumbest thing	no
30779	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	and get - get it ninety percent of the time. But when you	no
30780	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	start going	no
30781	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	is gonna give you the - you know, the right detector. So the idea is to have some ground truth first.	no
30782	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	"And so the i- the idea of the manual marking was to say ""O_K this, i- you know, it's - it's really here""."	no
30783	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	But I think Liz is saying why not get it out of the transcripts?	no
30784	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	What I mean is	no
30785	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh, yeah. We t- we t- w-	no
30786	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	A- or ge- get a first pass from those, and then go through sort of - It'd be a lot faster probably to -	no
30787	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	we t- we talked about that.	no
30788	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And you can -	no
30789	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, that's his, uh -	no
30790	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	We - we -	no
30791	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	we	no
30792	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, I just -	no
30793	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	the idea was, i- we i- i- we thought it would be useful for him to look at the data anyway,	no
30794	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	and - and then whatever he could mark would be helpful,	no
30795	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right.	no
30796	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	and we could -	no
30797	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh it's a question of what you bootstrap	no
30798	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	or do you bootstrap from some human being looking at it and then -	no
30799	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I mean, even with the close-talking mike you're not gonna get it right all the time.	no
30800	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well, that's what I wonder, because um - or how bad it is, be- um, because that would be interesting especially because the bottleneck is the	no
30801	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well-	no
30802	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I'm working on a program to do that, and -	no
30803	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I mean, we've got a lot more data than we have transcriptions for. We have the audio data, we have the close-talking mike, so I mean it seems like one kind of project that's not perfect, but -	no
30804	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30805	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	um, that you can get the	no
30806	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right, we discussed that.	no
30807	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And -	no
30808	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Oh.	no
30809	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I've - I've written a program to do that, and it, uh -	no
30810	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	O_K, I'm sorry I missed the -	no
30811	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	It's O_K.	no
30812	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	and -	no
30813	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	so - but it's - it's doing something very, very simple. It just takes a threshold, based on - on the volume,	no
30814	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh-huh.	no
30815	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Or you can set the threshold low and then weed out the false alarms by hand. Yeah.	no
30816	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right, by hand. Yeah.	no
30817	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	um, and then it does a median filter, and then it looks for runs.	no
30818	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And, it seems to work, I've - I'm sort of fiddling with the parameters,	no
30819	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	to get it to actually	no
30820	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	and I haven't - I don't - what I'm working on -	no
30821	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And so - I told - I said it would take about a day. I've worked on it for about half a day, so give me another half day and I- we'll have something we can play with.	no
30822	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I have to go.	no
30823	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	O_K.	no
30824	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	See, this is where we really need the Meeting Recorder query stuff to be working, because we've had these meetings and we've had this discussion about this, and I'm sort of remembering a	no
30825	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right. I'm sorry. I just -	no
30826	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	but I couldn't remember	no
30827	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	It-	no
30828	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	But -	no
30829	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I think it was partly that,	no
30830	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	you know,	no
30831	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	give somebody a chance to actually look at the data and see what these are like,	no
30832	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	partly that we have e- some ground	no
30833	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
30834	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh, and -	no
30835	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well, it's definitely good to have somebody look at it. I was just thinking as a way to speed up	no
30836	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	That was - that was exactly the notion that - that - that we discussed. So.	no
30837	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
30838	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	you know, the amount of -	no
30839	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30840	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	O_K.	no
30841	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Thanks.	no
30842	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	It looks good.	no
30843	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I have to go.	no
30844	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I'll be in touch. Thanks.	no
30845	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	S- See ya.	no
30846	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Just give me an email.	no
30847	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	O_K.	no
30848	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Was that um there m-	no
30849	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	that uh handle bleedthrough, I mean cuz you have this - this close - you have contamination from other people who speak loudly.	no
30850	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, and I haven't tried using that. It would probably help the program that I'm doing to first feed it through that.	no
30851	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	It's a cross-correlation filter.	no
30852	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So I - I haven't tried that, but that - If - It - it might be something - it might be a good way of cleaning it up a little.	no
30853	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So, some thought of maybe having -	no
30854	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, having that be a preprocessor and then run it through yours.	no
30855	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Exactly.	no
30856	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	But - but that's a refinement and I think we wanna see - try the simple thing first, cuz you add this complex thing up uh afterwards that does something good y- y- yo- you sort of wanna see what the simple thing does first.	no
30857	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yep.	no
30858	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	That's what we were discussing.	no
30859	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yep.	no
30860	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	But uh, having - having somebody have some experience, again, with - with uh - with marking it from a human standpoint, we're - I mean, I don't expect Jose	no
30861	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	to - to do it for uh f- fifty hours of -	no
30862	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	if uh - if he could speed up what he was doing by just getting the speaker overlaps so that we had it, say, for forty-five minutes,	no
30863	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30864	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Sure.	no
30865	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Sure.	no
30866	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	then at least we'd have three hundred examples of it. And when - when uh Adam was doing his automatic thing he could then compare to that and see what it was different.	no
30867	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30868	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Oh yeah, definitely.	no
30869	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30870	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	You know, I did - I did uh something almost	no
30871	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And uh,	no
30872	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	It seemed like the right thing to do.	no
30873	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah. I mean, you - you can get y- I mean, you get them pretty close.	no
30874	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	That was with zero literature search.	no
30875	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And so I think doing that to generate these	no
30876	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	possibilities and then going through and saying yes or no on	no
30877	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	That's good validation.	no
30878	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Is this proprietary?	no
30879	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, do you have a patent on it?	no
30880	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh.	no
30881	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	No. No.	no
30882	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	It was when I was working for the government.	no
30883	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Oh, then everybody owns it. It's the	no
30884	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well, I mean, is this something that we could just	no
30885	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Nah.	no
30886	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well, i- i- i- he's pretty close, anyway. I think - I think it's -	no
30887	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, he's - it - it doesn't take a long time.	no
30888	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right.	no
30889	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I just thought if it was tried and true, then -	no
30890	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Just output.	no
30891	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Although if you - if you have some parameters like what's a good window size for the median filter -	no
30892	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30893	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Oh!	no
30894	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And it might be	no
30895	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, good enough for government work, as they say.	no
30896	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	They - they -	no
30897	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Di- dif- different - different bandwidth.	no
30898	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	They d-	no
30899	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I was doing pretty short, you know, tenth of a second,	no
30900	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
30901	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	O_K.	no
30902	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh,	no
30903	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I don't know, it -	no
30904	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	if - if we want to uh -	no
30905	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So, uh, maybe we should move on to other - other things in limited time.	no
30906	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Can I ask one question about his statistics? So - so in the tw- twelve minutes,	no
30907	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30908	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30909	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	um, if we took three hundred and divided it by four, which is about the length of twelve minutes,	no
30910	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	i-	no
30911	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Um, I'd expect like there should be seventy-five overlaps. Did you find	no
30912	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh	no
30913	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	More than?	no
30914	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	More than - How many overlaps in your twelve minutes?	no
30915	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	How many? Eh, not	no
30916	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Onl- only I - I transcribe eh only twelve minutes	no
30917	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
30918	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30919	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	from the	no
30920	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	but eh I - I don't co- eh - I don't count eh the - the overlap.	no
30921	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	The overlaps.	no
30922	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I consider I - I - The - the nnn -	no
30923	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	The - the three hundred is eh considered only you - your transcription.	no
30924	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I have to -	no
30925	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I b- I bet they're	no
30926	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30927	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Middle or end.	no
30928	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30929	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Because i- we're - we're dealing with the - Uh, in the early meetings, we're	no
30930	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I'm not sure.	no
30931	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30932	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30933	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I think it's an empirical question. I think we could find that out. I'm - I'm not sure that the beginning had more.	no
30934	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30935	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yep.	no
30936	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So - so I was gonna ask, I guess about any - any other things that - that - that either of you wanted to talk about, especially since	no
30937	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Andreas is leaving in five minutes, that - that you wanna go with.	yes
30938	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Andreas is leaving in five minutes, that - that you wanna go with.	no
30939	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Can I just ask about the data, like very straightforward question is where we are on the amount of data and the amount of transcribed data, just cuz I'm -	no
30940	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I wanted to get a feel for that	no
30941	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	to sort of	no
30942	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	be able to know what - what can be done first and	no
30943	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right so there's this - this -	no
30944	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	There's this forty-five minute piece that Jane transcribed.	no
30945	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	That piece was then uh sent to I_B_M so	no
30946	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Then there's s- a larger piece that's been recorded and	no
30947	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh put on C_D-ROM and sent uh to I_B_M.	no
30948	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right? And then	no
30949	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	we don't know.	no
30950	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	How many	no
30951	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	What's that?	no
30952	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	That was about ten hours, and there was about -	no
30953	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, something like that. And then - then we r-	no
30954	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh-huh. O_K.	no
30955	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Ten meetings that have been sent to I_B_M?	no
30956	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And -	no
30957	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30958	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well, I haven't sent them yet because I was having this problem with the	no
30959	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Oh.	no
30960	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	O_K.	no
30961	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Oh, that's right, that had - those have	no
30962	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	H- how many total have we recorded now, altogether?	no
30963	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	About twelve	no
30964	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh-huh.	no
30965	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And we're recording only this meeting, like continuously we're only recording this one now? or - ?	no
30966	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	No.	no
30967	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Nope.	no
30968	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	No, so the - the - that's the - that's the biggest one - uh, chunk so far,	no
30969	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	It was the morning one.	no
30970	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	O_K.	no
30971	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	but there's at least one meeting recorded of uh the uh uh natural language guys.	no
30972	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Jerry.	no
30973	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Do they meet every week, or	no
30974	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And then there -	no
30975	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh, they	no
30976	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh, we've started having a morning meeting, today uh i- starting a w- a week or two ago, on the uh front-end issues, and we're recording those,	no
30977	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh there's a network services and applications group here who's agreed to have their meetings recorded,	no
30978	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Great.	no
30979	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	and we're gonna start recording them. They're - They meet on Tuesdays. We're gonna start recording them next week.	no
30980	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So actually, we're gonna h- start having a - a pretty significant chunk and	no
30981	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	so, you know,	no
30982	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	now that uh -	no
30983	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So right now, yeah, I th- I'd say the data is predominantly meeting meetings,	no
30984	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	but there are scattered other meetings in it and that - that amount is gonna grow uh so that the meeting meetings will probably ultimately -	no
30985	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	i- if we're - if we collect fifty or sixty hours, the meeting meetings it will probably be, you know, twenty or thirty percent of it, not - not - not eighty or ninety. But.	no
30986	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So there's probably - there's three to four a week,	no
30987	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	That's what we're aiming for.	no
30988	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	that we're aiming for.	no
30989	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
30990	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And they're each about an hour or something.	no
30991	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, yeah.	no
30992	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Although - Yeah.	no
30993	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	We'll find out tomorrow whether we can really do this or not.	no
30994	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So - O_K.	no
30995	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah and th- the - the other thing is I'm not pos- I'm sort of thinking as we've been through this a few times,	no
30996	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	that I really don't know -	no
30997	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	maybe you wanna do it once for the novelty,	no
30998	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	but I don't know if in general we wanna have meetings that we record from outside this group do the digits.	no
30999	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right.	no
31000	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Because it's just an added bunch of weird stuff. And, you know, we - we h- we're highly motivated.	no
31001	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
31002	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh in fact, the	yes
31003	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh in fact, the	no
31004	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Actually that's something I wanted to ask, is I have a bunch of scripts to help with the	no
31005	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
31006	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	We don't have to	no
31007	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right.	no
31008	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
31009	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And so I have some scripts that let you very quickly extract the sections of each utterance. But I haven't been ru- I haven't been	no
31010	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Um, if I	no
31011	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	is someone gonna be working on it?	no
31012	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh, yeah, I - I think	no
31013	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I mean, is it something of interest?	no
31014	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	definitely s- so- Absolutely. Yeah, whoever we have working on	no
31015	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	O_K.	no
31016	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Hmm.	no
31017	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	the acoustics for the Meeting Recorder are gonna start with that.	no
31018	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I mean, I-	no
31019	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I'm - I'm	no
31020	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I was - these meetings - I'm sure someone thought of this, but these -	no
31021	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So	no
31022	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	this uh reading of the numbers would be extremely helpful to do um adaptation. Um.	no
31023	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yep.	no
31024	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yep.	no
31025	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Actually I have o-	no
31026	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I - I would really like someone to do adaptation.	no
31027	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
31028	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well -	no
31029	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I mean, one of the things I wanted to do, uh, that I- I talked to -	no
31030	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Since it's the same people over and over.	no
31031	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	to	no
31032	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
31033	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	is to do block echo cancellation,	no
31034	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	to try to get rid of some of the effects of the - the - the far-field effects.	no
31035	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
31036	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Um, I mean we have -	no
31037	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	the party line has been that echo cancellation is not the right way to handle the situation because people move around,	no
31038	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	and uh, if - if it's - if it's uh not a simple echo, like a cross-talk kind of echo, but it's actually room acoustics, it's - it's - it's -	no
31039	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
31040	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	you can't really do inversion, and even echo cancellation is going to uh be something - It may - you -	no
31041	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	"Someone may be moving enough that you are not able to adapt quickly and so the tack that we've taken is more ""lets come up with feature approaches and multi-stream approaches and so forth, that will be"	no
31042	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
31043	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh, that's the party line.	no
31044	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	But it occurred to me a few months ago that uh	no
31045	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	party lines are always, you know, sort of dangerous. It's good -	no
31046	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	good to sort of	no
31047	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	we should	no
31048	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	that's something I'd like somebody to do at some point, just take these digits, take the far-field mike signal, and the close	no
31049	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh mike signal, and apply really good echo cancellation. Um,	no
31050	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Hmm.	no
31051	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	there was a - have been some nice talks recently by - by Lucent on - on their b-	no
31052	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	the	no
31053	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And um,	no
31054	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	you know, th-	no
31055	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	W- what is the um -	no
31056	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	the artifact you try to - you're trying to get rid of when you do that?	no
31057	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh so it's - it - you have a - a direct uh -	no
31058	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh, what's the difference in - If you were trying to construct a linear filter,	no
31059	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	that would um -	no
31060	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I'm signing off.	no
31061	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	that would subtract off	no
31062	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	the um	no
31063	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh parts of the signal that were the aspects of the signal that were different between the close-talk and the distant.	no
31064	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	You know, so - so uh	no
31065	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	um	no
31066	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I guess in most echo cancellation -	no
31067	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, so you - Given that um -	no
31068	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, so you're trying to - So you'd - There's a - a distance between the close and the distant mikes so there's a time delay there,	no
31069	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	and after the time delay, there's these various reflections.	no
31070	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And if you figure out well what's the - there's a - a least squares algorithm that adjusts itself - adjusts the weight so that you try to subtract - essentially to subtract off uh different uh - different reflections.	no
31071	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right? So let's take the simple case where you just had -	no
31072	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	you had some uh some delay in a satellite connection or something and then there's a - there's an	no
31073	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And you want to adjust this filter so that it will maximally reduce the effect of this echo.	no
31074	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So that would mean like if you were listening to the data that was recorded on one of those.	no
31075	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh, just the raw data, you would - you might hear kind of an echo?	no
31076	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And - and then this - noise cancellation would get-	no
31077	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well, I'm - I'm - I'm saying - That's a simplified version of what's	no
31078	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	you're getting the direct sound from my speech, but you're also getting,	no
31079	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh, the indirect sound that's bounced around the	no
31080	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	O_K?	no
31081	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So now, if you um try to r- you -	no
31082	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	To	no
31083	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	not to try to completely remove it, that is, invert the - the room response, but just	no
31084	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	to try to uh uh eliminate some of the - the effect of some of the echos.	no
31085	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Um, a number of people have done this so that, say, if you're talking to a speakerphone,	no
31086	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh it makes it more like it would be, if you were talking right up to it.	no
31087	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So this is sort of the st- the straight-forward approach.	no
31088	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	You say I - I - I want to	no
31089	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	and you have this - this	no
31090	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	um gets uh uh - gets subtracted off from the original speech.	no
31091	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Then you try to - you try to minimize the energy in some sense.	no
31092	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And so um -	no
31093	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh with some constraints.	no
31094	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Kind of a	no
31095	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	It's a clean up thing. Right. So,	no
31096	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	echo cancelling is - is, you know, commonly done in telephony,	no
31097	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	and - and - and	no
31098	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	it's sort of the obvious thing to do in this situation if you - if, you know,	no
31099	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	you're gonna be talking some distance from a mike.	no
31100	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I would have meetings with the folks in Cambridge when I was at B_B_N over the phone,	no
31101	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	they had a um -	no
31102	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	some kind of a special speaker phone and when they would first connect me,	no
31103	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	it would come on and we'd hear all this noise.	no
31104	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
31105	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And then it was uh - And then it would come on and it was very clear, you know.	no
31106	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right. So it's taking samples, it's doing adaptation, it's adjusting weights, and then it's getting the sum.	no
31107	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So um,	no
31108	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh	no
31109	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	and the digits would be a reasonable thing	no
31110	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	to	no
31111	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	i- for that sort of task you wouldn't care whether it was uh large vocabulary speech or anything. Uh.	no
31112	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Is Brian Kingsbury's work related to that, or is it a different type of reverberation?	no
31113	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Um	no
31114	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Brian's	no
31115	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	"f- f- from the opposite dogma. Right? Which is what I was calling the ""party line"", which is that"	no
31116	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh doing that sort of thing is not really what we want. We want something more flexible,	no
31117	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh i- i- where people might change their position, and there might be, you know -	no
31118	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	There's also um	no
31119	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	oh yeah,	no
31120	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	It's if you have a clean situation but you just have some delays,	no
31121	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Then we'll figure out the right - the right set of weights for your taps for your filter in order to produce the effect of those - those echos.	no
31122	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	But um	no
31123	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	if there's	no
31124	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	is corrupted so that it's decision about what the right -	no
31125	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	you know, right - right uh - delays are - is, uh - is -	no
31126	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	right delayed signal is - is - is - uh is incorrect.	no
31127	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And so, in a	no
31128	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	um,	no
31129	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	and really long delays, it's - it's sort of typically impractical.	no
31130	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So for those kind of reasons,	no
31131	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	and also a - a c- a complete inversion,	no
31132	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Um, that's difficult because um	no
31133	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	often times the - the um -	no
31134	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	the system transfer function is such that when it's inverted you get something that's unstable,	no
31135	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	and so, if you - you do your estimate of what the system is, and then you try to invert it, you get a filter that actually uh, you know,	no
31136	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	rings, and - and uh goes to infinity. So it's -	no
31137	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	so there's - there's - there's	no
31138	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	all sorts of reasons why it's not really practical. So for all those kinds of reasons, uh we - we - we sort of	no
31139	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	um, concluded we didn't want to in- do inversion, and we're even pretty skeptical of echo cancellation, which isn't really inversion,	no
31140	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	and um we decided to do this approach of taking - uh, just picking	no
31141	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh features, which were -	no
31142	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh will give you more - something that was more stable, in the presence of, or absence of, room reverberation, and that's what Brian was trying to do.	no
31143	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So, um, let me just say a couple things that I was - I was gonna	no
31144	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	bring up. Uh.	no
31145	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Let's see. I guess you - you actually already said this thing about the uh - about the consent forms,	no
31146	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	which was that we now don't have to -	no
31147	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So this was the human subjects folks who said this,	no
31148	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	The a- apparently - I mean, we're gonna do a revised form, of course. Um	no
31149	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	but once a person has signed it once, then that's	no
31150	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	valid for a certain number of meetings.	no
31151	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I told her that would be a little bit difficult to	no
31152	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	from a s- practical standpoint, maybe we could have	yes
31153	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	O_K.	no
31154	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Um, back on the	no
31155	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	We have - we have an hour	no
31156	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh that - that is transcribed, we have - we have twelve hours that's recorded but not transcribed,	no
31157	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	and at the rate we're going, uh by the end of the semester we'll have, I don't know, forty or fifty or something, if we - if this really uh -	no
31158	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well, do we have that much? Let's see, we have -	no
31159	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Not really. It's three to four per week.	no
31160	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So that's what - You know, that -	no
31161	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh eight weeks, uh is -	no
31162	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So that's not a lot of hours. Um -	no
31163	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Eight weeks times three hours is twenty-four, so that's - Yeah, so like thirty -	no
31164	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Three -	no
31165	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Three hours.	no
31166	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
31167	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	thirty hours?	no
31168	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I mean, is there - I know this sounds	no
31169	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I was starting to think of some projects where you would use	no
31170	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	well, similar to what we talked about with uh	no
31171	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	energy detection on the close-talking mikes. There are a number of	no
31172	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	interesting questions that you can ask about how interactions happen in a meeting, that don't require any transcription. So what are the patterns, the energy patterns over the meeting?	no
31173	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
31174	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And I'm really interested in this	no
31175	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	but we don't have	no
31176	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	a whole lot of data. So I was thinking, you know, we've got the room set up	no
31177	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	and you can always think of, also for political reasons, if ICSI collected	no
31178	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	you know,	no
31179	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	But I don't think we're gonna stop at the end of this semester.	no
31180	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right? So, I th- I think that if we are able to keep that up	no
31181	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	for a few months, we	no
31182	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I mean, is there - Are there any other meetings here that we can	no
31183	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	record,	no
31184	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I mean, that are less well - I don't -	no
31185	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh, that have some more emotional aspects to them, or strong -	no
31186	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	We had some	no
31187	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	There's laughter, um I'm talking more about strong differences of opinion meetings, maybe with manager types, or -	no
31188	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I think it's hard to	no
31189	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	To be	no
31190	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
31191	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, people will get -	no
31192	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	It's also likely that people will cancel out afterwards. But I - but I wanted to raise the K_P_F_A idea.	no
31193	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	O_K. Well,	no
31194	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, I was gonna mention that.	no
31195	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Oh,	no
31196	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
31197	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah. So - Yeah. So I - I - uh, I - I'd mentioned to Adam, and -	no
31198	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	that was another thing I was gonna talk - uh, mention to them before -	no
31199	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	that uh there's uh - It - it oc- it occurred to me that we might be able to get some additional data	no
31200	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	by talking to uh acquaintances in local broadcast media.	no
31201	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Because, you know, we had talked before about the problem about using found data,	no
31202	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	that - that uh it's just set up however they have it set up and we don't have any say about it and it's typically one microphone,	no
31203	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
31204	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	in a, uh, uh - or - and - and so it doesn't	no
31205	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
31206	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Um and so I do think we're gonna continue recording here and record what we	no
31207	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	But um, it	no
31208	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And uh they may be willing	no
31209	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	to record it uh with -	no
31210	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	With lapel mikes or something?	no
31211	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well, they probably already use lapel, but they might be able to have it - it wouldn't be that weird for them to have another mike that was somewhat distant. It wouldn't be exactly this setup,	no
31212	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right.	no
31213	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	but it would be that sort of thing,	no
31214	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Hunh.	no
31215	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	and what we were gonna get from U_W, you know, assuming they - they - they start recording, isn't -	no
31216	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right. No, I think that'd be	no
31217	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So,	no
31218	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	if we can get more data.	no
31219	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I - I - I - I was thinking of looking into that.	no
31220	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	the	no
31221	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	radio shows are not live,	no
31222	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh that we could invite them to have	no
31223	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	like some of their -	no
31224	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Hmm!	no
31225	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Wow!	no
31226	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well - Or - The thing is, they're not as averse to wearing one of these head-mount- I mean, they're on the	no
31227	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right, as we are.	no
31228	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right.	no
31229	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Um, I think that'd be fantastic cuz those kinds of panels and -	no
31230	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
31231	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Th- that's an - a side of style - a style that we're not collecting	no
31232	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And - and the - I mean, the other side to it was the - what -	no
31233	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	which is where we were	no
31234	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I'll talk to you more about it	no
31235	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	the radio stations and television stations already have stuff worked out	no
31236	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	presumably,	no
31237	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh related to, you know, legal issues and - and permissions and all that. I mean, they already do what they do - do whatever they do. So it's -	no
31238	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
31239	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh, it's - So it's - so it's another source. So I think	no
31240	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	it's something we should look into, you know, we'll collect what we collect here hopefully they will collect more at U_W also	no
31241	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	and um - and maybe we have this other source. But yeah I think that it's not unreasonable to aim at	no
31242	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	getting, you know, significantly in excess of a hundred hours. I mean, that was sort of our goal.	no
31243	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
31244	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	The thing was, I was	no
31245	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	in the - under this controlled situation we could at	no
31246	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And at the rate we're going we'll get pretty	no
31247	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And if we continue to collect some next semester, I think we should,	no
31248	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh -	no
31249	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	"Right. Yeah I was mostly trying to think, ""O_K, if you start a project,"	no
31250	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	within say a month, you know, how much data do you have to work with. And you - you wanna s- you wanna sort of fr-	no
31251	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	so um	no
31252	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	right	no
31253	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well, we don't even have it for this f- you know, forty-five minutes, that was -	no
31254	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Do -	no
31255	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Oh, do we now? So um, not	no
31256	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
31257	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right.	no
31258	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah. So I was thinking right now it's sort of this exploratory stuff where you - you look at the data, you use some primitive measures and get a feeling for what the scatter plots look like, and -	no
31259	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right.	no
31260	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right, right.	no
31261	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	and - and uh - and meanwhile we collect, and it's more like yeah, three months from now, or six months from now you can - you can do a lot of other things.	no
31262	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Cuz I'm not actually sure, just logistically that I can spend - you know, I don't wanna charge the time that I have on the project too early, before there's enough data to make	no
31263	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	good use of the time. And that's - and especially with the student	no
31264	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right.	no
31265	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh for instance this guy who seems -	no
31266	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
31267	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh anyway, I shouldn't say too much, but um if someone came that was great and wanted to do some real work and they have to end by the end of this school year in the spring, how much data will I	no
31268	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	have to work with, with that person. And so it's -	no
31269	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right.	no
31270	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	i- Yeah, so I would think, exploratory things now.	no
31271	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh, three months from now -	no
31272	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Um, I mean the transcriptions I think are a bit of an unknown cuz we haven't gotten those back yet as far as the timing,	no
31273	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	but I think as far as the collection, it doesn't seem to me l- like,	no
31274	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh, unreasonable to say that	no
31275	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh in	no
31276	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	January, you know, ro- roughly uh - which is roughly three months from now,	no
31277	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Hmm.	no
31278	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	we	no
31279	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And we just don't know about the	no
31280	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So that's -	no
31281	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, we need to - I think that there's a possibility that the transcript will need to be adjusted afterwards, and uh	no
31282	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yep.	no
31283	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	es-	no
31284	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right.	no
31285	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
31286	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh	no
31287	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right.	no
31288	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	um, well, more refined coding of overlaps, then definitely I think we should count on having an extra pass through.	no
31289	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I wanted to ask another a- a- aspect of the data collection.	no
31290	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	If they really have something they wanna talk about as opposed to something	no
31291	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	what we're trying to stay away from was artificial constructions, but I think if it's a real -	no
31292	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Why	no
31293	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I mean, I'm thinking, politically -	no
31294	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Stage some political debates.	no
31295	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	You could	no
31296	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well	no
31297	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	if you ha- If there are meetings here that happen that we can record even if we don't	no
31298	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	We don't have to do the digits at	no
31299	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh,	no
31300	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Then, having the data is very valuable, cuz I think it's	no
31301	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	um	no
31302	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	um, is another issue, but there's -	no
31303	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	there are research	no
31304	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	questions you can answer without the transcriptions, or at least that you can	no
31305	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	It seems like	no
31306	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yep.	no
31307	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So.	no
31308	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Would it help at all - I mean, we're already talking about sort of two	no
31309	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	levels of detail in meetings. One is uh	no
31310	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	um	no
31311	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	without doing the digits -	no
31312	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Or, I guess the	no
31313	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	You do, O_K.	no
31314	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I mean, absolutely, yeah. I'm really scared -	no
31315	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah. Yeah.	no
31316	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	It seems like it's a big part of this corpus is to have the close-talking mikes.	no
31317	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Um or at least, like, me personally? I would -	no
31318	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I see, O_K.	no
31319	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
31320	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I agree. And Mari also, we had - This came up when she- she was here. That's important.	no
31321	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Um.	no
31322	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, I - I -	no
31323	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So it's a great idea, and if it were	no
31324	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	b- By the -	no
31325	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	by the way, I don't think the transcriptions are	no
31326	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	path. Right? And - and um -	no
31327	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	d- Do you have any idea when - when uh the - you'll be able to send uh the ten hours to them?	no
31328	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well, I've been burning two C_Ds a day, which is about all I can do with the time I have. So it'll be early next week.	no
31329	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
31330	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
31331	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, O_K. So early next week we send it to them, and then - then we check with them to see if they've got it and we - we start, you know	no
31332	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yep.	no
31333	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	asking about the timing for it. So I think once	no
31334	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	it sorted out about how	no
31335	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yep.	no
31336	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, but -	no
31337	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well -	no
31338	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, who knows where they are.	no
31339	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Have they ever responded to you?	no
31340	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Nope.	no
31341	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Hhh.	no
31342	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, but -	no
31343	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	You know, so they - they - they have -	no
31344	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	What if -	no
31345	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	you know, they're volunteering their time and they have a lot of other things to do, right? But they -	no
31346	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, you - we can't complain.	no
31347	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
31348	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	But at any rate, they'll - I - I think	no
31349	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	once they get that sorted out, they're - they're making cassettes there, then they're handing it to someone who they - who's - who	no
31350	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	is doing it, and uh	no
31351	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I think	no
31352	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	it's not going to be - I don't think it's going to be	no
31353	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yep. I think that's probably true.	no
31354	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Really?	no
31355	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So it's the amount of -	no
31356	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	It's - it's just getting it	no
31357	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	It's pipeline, pipeline issues. Once the pipeline fills.	no
31358	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right. What about these lunch meetings - I mean, I don't know, if there's any way without too much more overhead, even if we don't ship it right away to I_B_M even if we just collect it here for awhile,	no
31359	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	you know, two or three more meeting a week, just to have the data, even if they're	no
31360	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	um not doing the digits, but they do wear the headphones?	no
31361	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	But the lunch meetings are pretty much one person getting up and -	no
31362	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	No, I meant, um, sorry, the meetings where people eat their lunch	no
31363	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	downstairs, maybe they don't wanna be recorded, but -	no
31364	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Oh, and we're just chatting?	no
31365	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Just the ch- the	no
31366	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, we have a lot of those.	no
31367	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I actually think that's	no
31368	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, the problem with that is I would - I think I would feel a little constrained to - You know?	no
31369	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	O_K.	no
31370	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	You don't wanna do it, cuz -	no
31371	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	O_K.	no
31372	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	"Uh, some of the meetings - You know, our ""soccer ball"" meeting? I guess none of you were there for our soccer ball meeting."	no
31373	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Alright.	no
31374	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Alright,	no
31375	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	That was hilarious.	no
31376	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	that we could record, I think it would be worth it.	no
31377	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah. Well, we should also check with Mari again, because they -	no
31378	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	because they were really	no
31379	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	you know, maybe just	no
31380	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	didn't	no
31381	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	in some level. So then that would double	no
31382	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	O_K.	no
31383	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right.	no
31384	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh.	no
31385	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And there's a lot of different meetings at U_W uh -	no
31386	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I mean really m- a lot more	no
31387	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right.	no
31388	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Is the uh, notion of recording any of Chuck's meetings dead in the water, or is that still a possibility?	no
31389	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh,	no
31390	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Um, but, again, Jerry is - Jerry's open - So I mean, we have	no
31391	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	two speech meetings, one uh network meeting,	no
31392	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh Jerry was open to it but I - I s-	no
31393	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	One of the things that I think is a little - a	no
31394	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	we probably can't do it every week.	no
31395	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	You know? I - I - I - I think that - that people are gonna feel uh -	no
31396	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Now, it	no
31397	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yep.	no
31398	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	What if we	no
31399	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	give people - you know, we cater a lunch in exchange for them having their meeting here or something?	no
31400	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well, you know, I - I	no
31401	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	O_K.	no
31402	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	w- um, I know that you don't want	no
31403	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	artificial topics, but	no
31404	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	um	no
31405	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	it	no
31406	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	do	no
31407	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	i- you know, people who are - Because, you know, there's also this	no
31408	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	a- and it just seems like maybe we could exploit the subj- human subject p- p- pool, in the positive sense of the word.	no
31409	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well, even - I mean, coming down from campus is sort of a big thing, but what about	no
31410	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	We could pay subjects.	no
31411	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	or what about people in the - in the building?	no
31412	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, I was thinking, there's all these other peo- Yeah.	no
31413	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I mean, there's the State of California	no
31414	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	downstairs, and -	no
31415	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I mean -	no
31416	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I just really doubt that uh any of the State of California meetings would be recordable and then releasable to the general public.	no
31417	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
31418	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Oh.	no
31419	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
31420	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So I - I mean I talked with some people at the Haas Business School who are i- who are interested in speech recognition	no
31421	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Alright, well.	no
31422	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	"and, they sort of hummed and hawed and said ""well maybe we could have meetings down here"", but then I got email from them that said ""no,"	no
31423	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	"we decided we're not really interested and we don't wanna come down and hold meetings."""	no
31424	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So, I think it's gonna be a problem to get people regularly.	no
31425	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	What about Joachim, maybe he can -	no
31426	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	But - but we c- But I think, you know, we get some scattered things from this and that. And I - I d- I	no
31427	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	maybe we can get somewhere with the - with the radio. Uh i- I have better contacts in radio than in television, but -	no
31428	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
31429	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	You could get a lot of lively discussions from those	no
31430	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yep.	no
31431	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well, and they're already - they're - these things are already recorded, we don't have to ask them to - even - and I'm not sure wh-	no
31432	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
31433	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
31434	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	No, I'm not talking about ones that are already recorded.	no
31435	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I'm talking about	no
31436	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Why - why not?	no
31437	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well, we can find out. I know for instance	no
31438	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right, that's the found data idea. But what I'm saying is uh if I talk to people that I know who	no
31439	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
31440	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	let's say, of a distant	no
31441	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
31442	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And u- I think	no
31443	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So, since I'm interested in the distant	no
31444	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right.	no
31445	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	and uh - But if we ask them to	no
31446	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh might be e- e- willing to - the - I might be able to talk them into it.	no
31447	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
31448	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Um. We're getting towards the end of our disk space, so we should think about trying to wrap up here.	no
31449	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	O_K. Well I don't - why don't we - why d- u- why don't we uh uh turn them - turn the -	no
31450	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	That's a good way to end a meeting.	no
31451	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	O_K, leave - leave them on for a moment until I turn this off, cuz that's when it crashed last time.	no
31452	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	That's good to know.	no
31453	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Turning off the microphone made it crash. Well -	no
31454	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	That's good to know.	no
31455	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	O_K.	yes
31456	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Now can you give me the uh	no
31457	transcript	transcript_Bed011	seven nine seven seven, five, eight one five	no
31458	transcript	transcript_Bed011	three two five, four one, six zero zero three	no

31464	transcript	transcript_Bed011	six one, four nine, zero one, six zero, six four.	no
31465	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K, so Eva, co- uh - could you read your numbers? Yeah.	no
31466	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Go ahead and read.	no
31467	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K.	no
31468	transcript	transcript_Bed011	zero, one nine four, five zero, five eight five, eight	no
31469	transcript	transcript_Bed011	nine four two eight, eight, seven three seven	no

31475	transcript	transcript_Bed011	zero one seven eight, zero, one four three	yes
31476	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Alright.	no
31477	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah, let's get started.	no
31478	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Um -	no
31479	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Hopefully Nancy will come, if not, she won't.	no
31480	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Uh, Robert, do you uh	no
31481	transcript	transcript_Bed011	have any way to turn off your uh	no
31482	transcript	transcript_Bed011	screensaver on there so that it's not going off every - uh, it seems to have about at two minute -	no
31483	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah, I've - I - uh - it's not that I didn't try.	no
31484	transcript	transcript_Bed011	and um I - I told it to stay on forever and ever, but if it's not plugged in it just doesn't obey my commands.	no
31485	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K.	no
31486	transcript	transcript_Bed011	It has a mind.	no
31487	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Got it.	no
31488	transcript	transcript_Bed011	But I-	no
31489	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Wants to conserve.	no
31490	transcript	transcript_Bed011	I just - You know, sort of keep on wiggling.	no
31491	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah, O_K.	yes
31492	transcript	transcript_Bed011	But uh - we'll just be m- m- working on it at intensity so it doesn't happen.	no
31493	transcript	transcript_Bed011	We'll see.	no
31494	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Should we plunge right into it?	no
31495	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
31496	transcript	transcript_Bed011	So, would you like to -	no
31497	transcript	transcript_Bed011	I think so.	no
31498	transcript	transcript_Bed011	So what I've tried to do here is	no
31499	transcript	transcript_Bed011	list all the decision nodes that we have identified on this	no
31500	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Commented and -	no
31501	transcript	transcript_Bed011	what they're about and sort of -	no
31502	transcript	transcript_Bed011	the properties we may	no
31503	transcript	transcript_Bed011	um	no
31504	transcript	transcript_Bed011	give them.	no
31505	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And here are the uh -	no
31506	transcript	transcript_Bed011	tasks to be implemented via our data collection. So all of these tasks -	no
31507	transcript	transcript_Bed011	The reading is out of these tasks	no
31508	transcript	transcript_Bed011	more or less imply that the user wants to go there,	no
31509	transcript	transcript_Bed011	sometime or the other.	no
31510	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And analogously	no
31511	transcript	transcript_Bed011	for example, here we have	no
31512	transcript	transcript_Bed011	our	no
31513	transcript	transcript_Bed011	EVA	no
31514	transcript	transcript_Bed011	um - intention.	no
31515	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And these are the	no
31516	transcript	transcript_Bed011	data tasks where w-	no
31517	transcript	transcript_Bed011	we can assume the person would like to enter, view or just approach	no
31518	transcript	transcript_Bed011	the thing. Analogously	no
31519	transcript	transcript_Bed011	the same on the object information	no
31520	transcript	transcript_Bed011	we can see that, you know, we have sort of	no
31521	transcript	transcript_Bed011	created these tasks before we came up with our decision nodes so there's a lot of things where we have no analogous	no
31522	transcript	transcript_Bed011	tasks, and	no
31523	transcript	transcript_Bed011	decision node so - trying to im-	no
31524	transcript	transcript_Bed011	um -	no
31525	transcript	transcript_Bed011	implant the intention of going to a place now, going to a place later on the same tour, or trying to plant the intention of going sometime	no
31526	transcript	transcript_Bed011	on the next tour, or the next day or whenever.	no
31527	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Right, right.	no
31528	transcript	transcript_Bed011	But I think that might be overdoing it a little.	yes
31529	transcript	transcript_Bed011	But I think that might be overdoing it a little.	no
31530	transcript	transcript_Bed011	So -	no
31531	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah. So let me pop up a level.	no
31532	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And uh	no
31533	transcript	transcript_Bed011	s- s- make sure that we're all oriented	no
31534	transcript	transcript_Bed011	the same. So	no
31535	transcript	transcript_Bed011	What we're gonna do today is two related things.	no
31536	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Uh one of them is to work on	no
31537	transcript	transcript_Bed011	the semantics of the belief-net which is going to be the main inference engine for thi- the system	no
31538	transcript	transcript_Bed011	uh making decisions. And decisions are going to turn out to be	no
31539	transcript	transcript_Bed011	parameter choices for calls on other modules.	no
31540	transcript	transcript_Bed011	so f- the natural language understanding thing	no
31541	transcript	transcript_Bed011	is uh, we think	no
31542	transcript	transcript_Bed011	gonna only have to choose parameters, but	no
31543	transcript	transcript_Bed011	You know, a fairly large set of parameters. So to do that, we need to do two things. One of which is figure out what all the choices are, which we've done a fair amount.	no
31544	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Then we need to figure out what influences its choices and finally we have to do some technical work on	no
31545	transcript	transcript_Bed011	the actual belief relations and	no
31546	transcript	transcript_Bed011	presumably estimates of the probabilities and stuff. But we aren't gonna do the probability stuff today.	no
31547	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Technical stuff we'll do -	no
31548	transcript	transcript_Bed011	uh -	no
31549	transcript	transcript_Bed011	another day. Probably next week.	no
31550	transcript	transcript_Bed011	But we are gonna worry about	no
31551	transcript	transcript_Bed011	all the decisions and the things that pert- that contribute to them. And	no
31552	transcript	transcript_Bed011	we're also, sort of uh in the same process,	no
31553	transcript	transcript_Bed011	going to work with Fey on	no
31554	transcript	transcript_Bed011	what there should be in the dialogues. So	no
31555	transcript	transcript_Bed011	One of the s- steps that's coming up real soon is to actually get subjects	no
31556	transcript	transcript_Bed011	uh - in here, and have them	no
31557	transcript	transcript_Bed011	actually record like this.	no
31558	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Uh record dialogues more or less.	no
31559	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And -	no
31560	transcript	transcript_Bed011	depending on	no
31561	transcript	transcript_Bed011	what Fey sort of provokes them to say, we'll get information on different things.	no
31562	transcript	transcript_Bed011	So -	no
31563	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Well how people phrase different intentions more or less, huh?	no
31564	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Fo- v- yeah- people with the - phrase them and so -	no
31565	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Uh for, you know, Keith and people worrying about what constructions people use,	no
31566	transcript	transcript_Bed011	uh - we have some i- we have some ways to	no
31567	transcript	transcript_Bed011	affect that by the way the dialogues go.	no
31568	transcript	transcript_Bed011	So what Robert kindly did, is to lay out	no
31569	transcript	transcript_Bed011	a table of the kinds of uh	no
31570	transcript	transcript_Bed011	and,	no
31571	transcript	transcript_Bed011	the kinds of decisions. So the uh -	no
31572	transcript	transcript_Bed011	uh - on the left are decision nodes,	no
31573	transcript	transcript_Bed011	and	no
31574	transcript	transcript_Bed011	discreet values. So if - if we're right,	no
31575	transcript	transcript_Bed011	you can get by with	no
31576	transcript	transcript_Bed011	um	no
31577	transcript	transcript_Bed011	just this middle column worth of decisions, and it's not all that many, and it's perfectly feasible technically to build belief-nets	no
31578	transcript	transcript_Bed011	that will do that. And he has a handout.	no
31579	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah. Maybe it was too fast plunging in there, because	no
31580	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
31581	transcript	transcript_Bed011	j- we have two updates. Um you can look at	no
31582	transcript	transcript_Bed011	what our subject's going to have to fill out. Any comments I can - can still be made and the changes will be put in	no
31583	transcript	transcript_Bed011	m-	no
31584	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Let me summarize in two sentences, mainly for Eva's benefit, who probably has not heard about the data collection, at all. Or have you heard about it?	no
31585	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K.	no
31586	transcript	transcript_Bed011	No.	no
31587	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Not that much	no
31588	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K. We were gonna put this in front of people. They give us some information on themselves.	no
31589	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Then - then they will read uh - a task where lots of German words are sort of thrown in between.	no
31590	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K.	no
31591	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And um - and they have to read isolated proper names	no
31592	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And these change -	no
31593	transcript	transcript_Bed011	S-	no
31594	transcript	transcript_Bed011	I don't see a release	no
31595	transcript	transcript_Bed011	No, this is not the release form. This is the speaker	no
31596	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Got it. O_K, fine. O_K.	no
31597	transcript	transcript_Bed011	information form. The release form is over there in that box.	no
31598	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Alright, fair enough.	no
31599	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And um -	no
31600	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And then they gonna have to f-	no
31601	transcript	transcript_Bed011	um	no
31602	transcript	transcript_Bed011	um	no
31603	transcript	transcript_Bed011	choose from one of these tasks, which are listed here. They - they pick a couple, say three - uh - uh six as a matter of fact.	no
31604	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Six different things they sort of think they would do if they were in Heidelberg or traveling someplace -	no
31605	transcript	transcript_Bed011	and um -	no
31606	transcript	transcript_Bed011	and they have a map.	no
31607	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Hmm.	no
31608	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Like this. Very sketchy, simplified map.	no
31609	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And they can take notes on that map.	no
31610	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And then they call this computer system that works perfectly, and understands everything.	no
31611	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K.	no
31612	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And um -	no
31613	transcript	transcript_Bed011	This is a fictional system obviously, huh.	no
31614	transcript	transcript_Bed011	The comp-	no
31615	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah, the computer system sits right in front of you, that's Fey.	no
31616	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yes. I've - I understand everything. Yes I do.	no
31617	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And she does know everything.	no
31618	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"And she has a way of making this machine talk. So she can copy sentences into a window, or type really fast and this machine will use speech synthesis to produce that. So if you ask ""How do I get to the castle"" then a m- s- several seconds later it'll come out of here ""In order to get to the castle you do -"""	no
31619	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And um -	no
31620	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And then after three tasks the system breaks down.	no
31621	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And Fey comes on the phone as a human operator.	no
31622	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"And says ""Sorry the system broke down but let's continue."" And we sort of get the idea what"	no
31623	transcript	transcript_Bed011	people do when they s- think they speak to a machine and what people say when they think they speak to a human,	no
31624	transcript	transcript_Bed011	or know, or assume they speak to a human.	no
31625	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K.	no
31626	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Huh.	no
31627	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.	no
31628	transcript	transcript_Bed011	That's the data collection.	no
31629	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And um -	no
31630	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And Fey has some thirty subjects lined up? Something?	no
31631	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah. And more and more every day.	no
31632	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And um -	no
31633	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And they're - r-	no
31634	transcript	transcript_Bed011	ready uh - to roll. And we're gonna start tomorrow at three? four? one?	no
31635	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Tomorrow, well we don't know for sure. Because we don't know whether that person is coming or not, but -	no
31636	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K. Around four-ish.	no
31637	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And um we're still l- looking for a room on the sixth floor because they stole away that conference room.	no
31638	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Um - behind our backs. But -	no
31639	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Well, there are these - uh - uh - oh, I see, we have to - Yeah, it's tricky. We'll - let's - let - we'll do that off-line, O_K.	no
31640	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah, but I - i- i- it's happening. David and - and Jane and - and Lila are working on that as we speak.	no
31641	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K.	no
31642	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K.	no
31643	transcript	transcript_Bed011	That was the uh -	no
31644	transcript	transcript_Bed011	the data collection in a nutshell.	no
31645	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And um -	no
31646	transcript	transcript_Bed011	I can report a - so I did this but I also tried to do	no
31647	transcript	transcript_Bed011	this - so if I click on here, Isn't this wonderful?	no
31648	transcript	transcript_Bed011	we get to the uh -	no
31649	transcript	transcript_Bed011	uh belief-net just focusing on - on the g-	no
31650	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Go-there node. uh - Analogously this would be sort of the reason node and the timing node and so forth. And what w-	no
31651	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Mm-hmm.	no
31652	transcript	transcript_Bed011	what happened is that	no
31653	transcript	transcript_Bed011	um	no
31654	transcript	transcript_Bed011	design-wise I'd sort of n- noticed that we can -	no
31655	transcript	transcript_Bed011	we still get a lot of	no
31656	transcript	transcript_Bed011	errors from a lot of points to one of these sub Go-there User Go-there Situation nodes.	no
31657	transcript	transcript_Bed011	So I came up with a couple of additional nodes here where um whether the user is thrifty or not, and what his budget is currently like, is going to result in some financial state of the user. How much will he - is he willing to spend?	no
31658	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Or can spend. Being the same at this - just the money available, which may influence us, whether he wants to go there if it is - you know - charging	no
31659	transcript	transcript_Bed011	tons of dollars for admission or its gonna g- cost a lot of t- e-	no
31660	transcript	transcript_Bed011	whatever. Twenty-two million to fly to	no
31661	transcript	transcript_Bed011	International Space Station, you know.	no
31662	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Right.	no
31663	transcript	transcript_Bed011	just -	no
31664	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Not all people can do that.	no
31665	transcript	transcript_Bed011	So, and this actually turned out to be	no
31666	transcript	transcript_Bed011	pretty key, because	no
31667	transcript	transcript_Bed011	having specified sort of these - uh - this - this - intermediate level	no
31668	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Um	no
31669	transcript	transcript_Bed011	and sort of noticing that	no
31670	transcript	transcript_Bed011	everything that	no
31671	transcript	transcript_Bed011	favorite endpoint one	no
31672	transcript	transcript_Bed011	is again	no
31673	transcript	transcript_Bed011	more or less - we have - um - then the situation	no
31674	transcript	transcript_Bed011	nodes contributing to the - the endpoint situation node, which contributes to the endpoint and so forth.	no
31675	transcript	transcript_Bed011	um - I can now sort of draw straight lines from these to here, meaning it	no
31676	transcript	transcript_Bed011	g- of course goes where the sub-S_ -	no
31677	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"everything that comes from situation, everything that comes from user goes with the sub-U_, and whatever we specify for the so-called ""Keith node"", or the discourse, what comes from the - um -"	no
31678	transcript	transcript_Bed011	parser, construction parser, um will contribute to the D_ and the ontology to the sub-O_ node.	no
31679	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And um	no
31680	transcript	transcript_Bed011	one just s- sort of has to watch which -	no
31681	transcript	transcript_Bed011	also final decision node so it doesn't make sense -	no
31682	transcript	transcript_Bed011	t- to figure out whether he wants to enter, view or approach an object if he never wants to go there in the first place.	no
31683	transcript	transcript_Bed011	But this makes the design thing fairly simple.	no
31684	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And um	no
31685	transcript	transcript_Bed011	now all w- that's left to do then is the C_P_G's, the conditional probabilities, for the likelihood of a person having enough money, actually wanting to go a place if it costs, you know this or that.	no
31686	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And um -	no
31687	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K.	no
31688	transcript	transcript_Bed011	and once um Bhaskara has finished his classwork that's where we're gonna end up doing. You get involved in that process too.	no
31689	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And um -	no
31690	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And for now uh-	no
31691	transcript	transcript_Bed011	the - the question	no
31692	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"is ""How much of these decisions do we want to build in explicitly into our"	no
31693	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"data collection?"""	no
31694	transcript	transcript_Bed011	So -	no
31695	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Um, one could -	no
31696	transcript	transcript_Bed011	sort of - think of -	no
31697	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"you know we could call the z- see or - you know, people who visit the zoo we could s- call it ""Visit the zoo tomorrow"", so we have"	no
31698	transcript	transcript_Bed011	an intention of seeing something, but not now - but later.	no
31699	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Right.	no
31700	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah. Yeah, so -	no
31701	transcript	transcript_Bed011	let's s- uh- s-	no
31702	transcript	transcript_Bed011	see I th- I think that	no
31703	transcript	transcript_Bed011	from	no
31704	transcript	transcript_Bed011	one point of view,	no
31705	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Uh, um, all these places are the same, so that d- d-	no
31706	transcript	transcript_Bed011	That, um -	no
31707	transcript	transcript_Bed011	in terms of the linguistics and stuff,	no
31708	transcript	transcript_Bed011	there may be a few different kinds of places, so	no
31709	transcript	transcript_Bed011	I th- i- it seems to me that	no
31710	transcript	transcript_Bed011	We ought to decide	no
31711	transcript	transcript_Bed011	you know, what things are k- are actually going to matter to us.	no
31712	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And um, so the zoo, and the university and the castle, et cetera.	no
31713	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Um are all big-ish things that	no
31714	transcript	transcript_Bed011	um - you know - have different parts to them, and one of them might be fine.	no
31715	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Hmm.	no
31716	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Hmm, hmm. Yeah - The - the reason why we did it that way, as a - as a reminder, is uh -	no
31717	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And -	no
31718	transcript	transcript_Bed011	no person is gonna	no
31719	transcript	transcript_Bed011	do all of them. They're just gonna select u-	no
31720	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"um, according to their preferences. ""Ah, yeah, I usually visit zoos, or I usually visit castles, or I usually -"" And then you pick that one."	no
31721	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah, yeah.	no
31722	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Right, no no, but - but s- th- point is	no
31723	transcript	transcript_Bed011	They're redundant.	no
31724	transcript	transcript_Bed011	to - to y- to -	no
31725	transcript	transcript_Bed011	build a system that's got everything in it that might happen you do one thing.	no
31726	transcript	transcript_Bed011	T- to build a system that um - had the most data	no
31727	transcript	transcript_Bed011	on a relatively confined set of things, you do something else.	no
31728	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And the speech people, for example, are gonna do better	no
31729	transcript	transcript_Bed011	if they - if - things come up	no
31730	transcript	transcript_Bed011	uh - repeatedly. Now, of course, if everybody says exactly the same thing then it's not interesting.	no
31731	transcript	transcript_Bed011	So, all I'm saying is i- th- there's -	no
31732	transcript	transcript_Bed011	there's a kind of question of what we're trying t- to accomplish.	no
31733	transcript	transcript_Bed011	and -	no
31734	transcript	transcript_Bed011	I think my temptation for the data gathering would be to	no
31735	transcript	transcript_Bed011	uh, you know - And each person is only gonna do it once, so you don't have to worry about them being bored, so if - if it's one service, one luxury item, you know, one big-ish place, and so forth and so on, um -	no
31736	transcript	transcript_Bed011	then	no
31737	transcript	transcript_Bed011	my guess is that - that the data is going to be easier	no
31738	transcript	transcript_Bed011	to handle. Now of course you have this	no
31739	transcript	transcript_Bed011	I guess possible danger that somehow there're certain constructions that people use	no
31740	transcript	transcript_Bed011	uh when talking about a museum that they wouldn't talk about with a university and stuff,	no
31741	transcript	transcript_Bed011	um -	no
31742	transcript	transcript_Bed011	but I guess I'm - I- uh- m- my temptation is to go for simpler.	no
31743	transcript	transcript_Bed011	You know, less variation. But I don't know what other people think about this in terms of -	no
31744	transcript	transcript_Bed011	uh -	no
31745	transcript	transcript_Bed011	So I don't exactly understand - like I- I - I guess we're trying to -	no
31746	transcript	transcript_Bed011	limit the detail of our ontology or types of places that someone could go, right?	no
31747	transcript	transcript_Bed011	But who is it that has to care about this, or what component of the system?	no
31748	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Oh, well, uh - th- I think there are two places where it comes up. One is	no
31749	transcript	transcript_Bed011	uh - in the - th- these people who are gonna take this and - and try to do speech with it.	no
31750	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Mm-hmm.	no
31751	transcript	transcript_Bed011	uh - Lots of pronunciations of th- of the same thing are going to give you	no
31752	transcript	transcript_Bed011	better data	no
31753	transcript	transcript_Bed011	than	no
31754	transcript	transcript_Bed011	l- you know, a few pronunciations of lots more things.	no
31755	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K.	no
31756	transcript	transcript_Bed011	That's one.	no
31757	transcript	transcript_Bed011	So we would rather just	no
31758	transcript	transcript_Bed011	ask - uh have a bunch of people talk about the zoo,	no
31759	transcript	transcript_Bed011	uh and assume that that will -	no
31760	transcript	transcript_Bed011	that the constructions that they use there will give us everything we need to know about these sort of	no
31761	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Bigger -	no
31762	transcript	transcript_Bed011	zoo, castle, whatever type things, these bigger places.	no
31763	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Y- yeah thi- well this is a question for -	no
31764	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"And that way you get the speech data of people saying ""zoo"" over and over again or whatever too. O_K."	no
31765	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
31766	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
31767	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah. So this is a question for you, and, you know, if we - if we do, and we probably will, actually try to uh build a prototype,	no
31768	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Mm-hmm.	no
31769	transcript	transcript_Bed011	uh	no
31770	transcript	transcript_Bed011	probably we could get by	no
31771	transcript	transcript_Bed011	with the prototype only handling a few of them anyway.	no
31772	transcript	transcript_Bed011	So,	no
31773	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Um -	no
31774	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah, the-	no
31775	transcript	transcript_Bed011	this was sort of - these are all different sort of activities.	no
31776	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Um	no
31777	transcript	transcript_Bed011	But I think y- I - I got the point and I think I like it. We can do -	no
31778	transcript	transcript_Bed011	put them in a more hierarchical fashion. So,	no
31779	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"""Go to place"" and then give them a choice, you know either they're the symphony type or opera type or the tourist site guide type or the nightclub disco type person and they say ""yeah this is -"	no
31780	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"on that ""go to big-ish place"", this is what I would do."""	no
31781	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Mm-hmm.	no
31782	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"And then we have the ""Fix"" thing, and then maybe ""Do something the other day"" thing, so."	no
31783	transcript	transcript_Bed011	My question is -	no
31784	transcript	transcript_Bed011	I guess, to some extent, we should - y- we just have to try it out and see if it works. It would be	no
31785	transcript	transcript_Bed011	challenging, in - in a sense, to try to make it so - so complex that they even really should	no
31786	transcript	transcript_Bed011	schedule, or to plan it, uh, a more complex	no
31787	transcript	transcript_Bed011	thing in terms of O_K, you know, they should get the feeling that there are	no
31788	transcript	transcript_Bed011	these s- six things they have to do	no
31789	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Well - yeah.	no
31790	transcript	transcript_Bed011	and they sh- can be done maybe in two days.	no
31791	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Well I think th- th- yeah.	no
31792	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"So they make these decisions, ""Can I go there tomorrow?"" or - you know - influences"	no
31793	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
31794	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Mm-hmm.	no
31795	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Well, I think it's easy enough to set that up if that's your expectation. So,	no
31796	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"the uh system could say, ""Well, uh we'd like to - to set up your program for two days"	no
31797	transcript	transcript_Bed011	in Heidelberg,	no
31798	transcript	transcript_Bed011	you know, let's first think about all the things you might like to do.	no
31799	transcript	transcript_Bed011	So there - th- i- i- in - I mean - in - I th- I - I'm sure that if that's what you did then they would start telling you about that, and then you could get into um various things about ordering, if you wanted.	no
31800	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Mm-hmm.	no
31801	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
31802	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"Yeah, but I think this is part of the instructor's job. And that can be done, sort of to say, ""O_K now we've picked these six tasks."""	no
31803	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"""Now you have- you can call the system and you have two days."""	no
31804	transcript	transcript_Bed011	I'm sorry. No, we have to help - we have to decide. Fey will p- carry out whatever we decide.	no
31805	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And th- w-	no
31806	transcript	transcript_Bed011	But we have to decide	no
31807	transcript	transcript_Bed011	you know, what is the appropriate scenario.	no
31808	transcript	transcript_Bed011	That's what we're gonna talk about t- yeah.	no
31809	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yep, yep.	no
31810	transcript	transcript_Bed011	But these are two different scenarios entirely. I mean, one is a planner -	no
31811	transcript	transcript_Bed011	The other, it kind of give you instructions on the spot	no
31812	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"Yeah, but th- the - I don't - I'm not really interested in sort of ""Phase planning"" capabilities."	no
31813	transcript	transcript_Bed011	So are we gonna masquerade the system as this - as you said simple response system,	no
31814	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"""I have one question I get one response"", or should"	no
31815	transcript	transcript_Bed011	we allow for a certain level of complexity. And a- I w- think the data would be nicer if we get temporal	no
31816	transcript	transcript_Bed011	references.	no
31817	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Well, so Keith, what do you think?	no
31818	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Well, um	no
31819	transcript	transcript_Bed011	it seems that - Yeah, I mean,	no
31820	transcript	transcript_Bed011	off the top of my head it kinda seems like you would probably just want, you know, richer data, more complex stuff going on, people trying to do more complex sets of things. I mean	no
31821	transcript	transcript_Bed011	be able to handle a whole bunch of different stuff, then throwing harder situations at people will get them to do more linguistic - more interesting linguistic stuff.	no
31822	transcript	transcript_Bed011	But I mean - I'm - I'm not really sure	no
31823	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Uh, because I don't	no
31824	transcript	transcript_Bed011	fully understand like what our choices are of ways to do this here yet.	no
31825	transcript	transcript_Bed011	I mean w- we have tested this and a- y- have you heard - listen to the f- first two or th- as a matter of fact the second person is uh - is - was faced with exactly this kind of setup.	no
31826	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And -	no
31827	transcript	transcript_Bed011	I started to listen to one and it was just like, um,	no
31828	transcript	transcript_Bed011	uh,	no
31829	transcript	transcript_Bed011	sort of depressing.	no
31830	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Oh, O_K. That was the first subject.	no
31831	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
31832	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
31833	transcript	transcript_Bed011	First one wasn't very good.	no
31834	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
31835	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
31836	transcript	transcript_Bed011	So um, I -	no
31837	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Although -	no
31838	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Um, it is - already with this it got pretty - with this setup	no
31839	transcript	transcript_Bed011	and that particular subject	no
31840	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Mm-hmm.	no
31841	transcript	transcript_Bed011	it got pretty complex. Maybe -	no
31842	transcript	transcript_Bed011	I suggest we	no
31843	transcript	transcript_Bed011	make some fine tuning of these,	no
31844	transcript	transcript_Bed011	get - sort of - run through ten or so subjects and then take a breather, and see whether we wanna make it more complex or not, depending on what - what sort of results we're getting.	no
31845	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Mm-hmm.	no
31846	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Right.	no
31847	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah. It - In fact, um,	no
31848	transcript	transcript_Bed011	I am just	no
31849	transcript	transcript_Bed011	you know - today, next couple days gonna start really diving into this data. I've basically looked at one of the files - you know one of these - l- y- y- y- you gave me those dozens of files and I looked at one of them which was about ten sentences,	no
31850	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"found fifteen, twenty different construction types that we would have to look for and so on and like, ""alright, well, let's start here."" Um. So I haven't really gone into the, you know - looked at all of the stuff that's going on. So I don't really -"	no
31851	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Right, I mean,	no
31852	transcript	transcript_Bed011	once I start doing that I'll have more to say about this kind of thing.	no
31853	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K.	no
31854	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And y- and always -	no
31855	transcript	transcript_Bed011	But well th- but you did say something important, which is	no
31856	transcript	transcript_Bed011	that	no
31857	transcript	transcript_Bed011	um you can probably keep yourself fairly well occupied	no
31858	transcript	transcript_Bed011	uh - with the simple cases for quite a while.	no
31859	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
31860	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Although, obviously th- so - so that sa- s- does suggest that -	no
31861	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Uh, now, I have looked at all the data, and it's pre- it's actually	no
31862	transcript	transcript_Bed011	at least to an amateur, quite redundant. That - that it was - it was very stylized,	no
31863	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah, Yeah.	no
31864	transcript	transcript_Bed011	and quite a lot of people said more or less the same thing.	no
31865	transcript	transcript_Bed011	I um - I did sort of scan it at first and noticed that, and then looked in detail at one of them. But yeah, yeah I noticed that, too.	no
31866	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
31867	transcript	transcript_Bed011	So, we - we - we wanna do more than that.	no
31868	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And with this we're getting more.	no
31869	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K.	no
31870	transcript	transcript_Bed011	No question.	no
31871	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Right.	no
31872	transcript	transcript_Bed011	So -	no
31873	transcript	transcript_Bed011	uh w- do we wanna get going beyond more, which is sort of the -	no
31874	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Well, O_K, so let's - let's take - let's I -	no
31875	transcript	transcript_Bed011	I think your suggestion is good, which is	no
31876	transcript	transcript_Bed011	we'll do a b- uh - a batch.	no
31877	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K.	no
31878	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And, uh, Fey, How long is it gonna be till you have ten subjects?	no
31879	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Couple days? Or thr- f- a-	no
31880	transcript	transcript_Bed011	A week? Or - I don't - I don't have a feel for th-	no
31881	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Um - I can - Yeah, I mean I s- I think can probably schedule ten people,	no
31882	transcript	transcript_Bed011	uh,	no
31883	transcript	transcript_Bed011	whenever.	no
31884	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Well, it's - it's up to you, I mean I j- I - uh- e- We don't have any huge time pressure. It's just - when you have t- Yeah.	no
31885	transcript	transcript_Bed011	How long will it be? Um - I - I would say maybe two weeks.	no
31886	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Oh, O_K.	no
31887	transcript	transcript_Bed011	So let's do this. Let's plan next Monday,	no
31888	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K, to have a review of what we have	no
31889	transcript	transcript_Bed011	so far.	no
31890	transcript	transcript_Bed011	and -	no
31891	transcript	transcript_Bed011	This means audio, but -	no
31892	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Huh?	no
31893	transcript	transcript_Bed011	no transcriptions of course, yeah.	no
31894	transcript	transcript_Bed011	No, we won't have the transcriptions, but what we should	no
31895	transcript	transcript_Bed011	be able to do	no
31896	transcript	transcript_Bed011	and I don't know if, Fey, if you will have time to do this, but it would be great if you could, um,	no
31897	transcript	transcript_Bed011	not transcribe it all, but pick out	no
31898	transcript	transcript_Bed011	uh, some stuff. I mean we	no
31899	transcript	transcript_Bed011	could lis- uh - just sit here and listen to it all.	no
31900	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Are you gonna have the audio on the web site?	no
31901	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K.	no
31902	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Until we reach the gigabyte thing and David Johnson s-	no
31903	transcript	transcript_Bed011	ki- kills me.	no
31904	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And we're gonna put it on the web site. Yeah.	no
31905	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Oh, we could get - I mean, you can buy another disk for two hundred dollars, right? I mean it's - it's not like - O_K.	no
31906	transcript	transcript_Bed011	So, we'll take care of David Johnson. O_K.	no
31907	transcript	transcript_Bed011	No, he -	no
31908	transcript	transcript_Bed011	uh, he - he has been solving all our problems or - is wonderful, so s-	no
31909	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K.	no
31910	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Alright. So we'll buy a disk. But anyway, so,	no
31911	transcript	transcript_Bed011	um,	no
31912	transcript	transcript_Bed011	If you - if you can think of a way -	no
31913	transcript	transcript_Bed011	to	no
31914	transcript	transcript_Bed011	uh, point us to th- to interesting things, sort of as you're doing this or - or something	no
31915	transcript	transcript_Bed011	uh, make your - make notes or something that - that this is, you know, something worth looking at. And	no
31916	transcript	transcript_Bed011	other than that, yeah I guess we'll just have to	no
31917	transcript	transcript_Bed011	uh, listen - although I guess it's only ten minutes each, right? Roughly.	no
31918	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Well, I guess. I'm not sure how long it's actually going to take.	no
31919	transcript	transcript_Bed011	The reading task is a lot shorter. That was cut by fifty percent. And the reading,	no
31920	transcript	transcript_Bed011	nobody's interested in that except for the speech people.	no
31921	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Right. No, we don't care about that at all.	no
31922	transcript	transcript_Bed011	So.	no
31923	transcript	transcript_Bed011	It's actually like five minutes dialogue.	no
31924	transcript	transcript_Bed011	I- b- My guess is it's gonna be ten.	no
31925	transcript	transcript_Bed011	People -	no
31926	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Ten minutes is long.	no
31927	transcript	transcript_Bed011	I understand, but people - people - you know uh -	no
31928	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah. It feels like forever when you're doing it, but then it turns out to be three minutes and forty five seconds.	no
31929	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
31930	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
31931	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
31932	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Could be. O_K. I was thinking people would, you know, hesitate and -	no
31933	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Whatever. Whatever it is we'll - we'll deal with it.	no
31934	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah, it's not -	no
31935	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K, so that'll be - that'll be -	no
31936	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And it's fun.	no
31937	transcript	transcript_Bed011	um - on - on the web page.	no
31938	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K.	no
31939	transcript	transcript_Bed011	That's great.	no
31940	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Um	no
31941	transcript	transcript_Bed011	But anyway - yeah, so I think -	no
31942	transcript	transcript_Bed011	it's a good idea to start with the sort of relatively straight forward res- just response system.	no
31943	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And then if we want to	no
31944	transcript	transcript_Bed011	uh - get them to start doing - uh - multiple step planning with a whole bunch of things and then organize them an-	no
31945	transcript	transcript_Bed011	um tell them which things are near each other and -	no
31946	transcript	transcript_Bed011	you know, any of that stuff.	no
31947	transcript	transcript_Bed011	uh -	no
31948	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"You know, ""Which things would you like to do Tuesday morning?"""	no
31949	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
31950	transcript	transcript_Bed011	So yeah I - th- that seems -	no
31951	transcript	transcript_Bed011	pretty straight forward.	no
31952	transcript	transcript_Bed011	But were you saying that -	no
31953	transcript	transcript_Bed011	I need those back by the way.	no
31954	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K.	no
31955	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K.	no
31956	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
31957	transcript	transcript_Bed011	I'm sorry, Fey, what?	no
31958	transcript	transcript_Bed011	That w-	no
31959	transcript	transcript_Bed011	maybe one thing we should do is go through this list and sort of select things that are categories and then o-	no
31960	transcript	transcript_Bed011	offer only one member of that category?	no
31961	transcript	transcript_Bed011	That's what I was suggesting for the first round, yeah.	no
31962	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K.	no
31963	transcript	transcript_Bed011	So rather than having zoo and castle.	no
31964	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And then, I mean, they could be alternate versions of the same -	no
31965	transcript	transcript_Bed011	They could, but i- but i- uh- tha-	no
31966	transcript	transcript_Bed011	If you wanted data on different	no
31967	transcript	transcript_Bed011	eh- they- c- yeah, but - uh -	no
31968	transcript	transcript_Bed011	constructions.	no
31969	transcript	transcript_Bed011	but -	no
31970	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Like one person gets the version with the zoo as a choice, and the other person gets the -	no
31971	transcript	transcript_Bed011	You could, but i- but I - I - I think in the short run, -	no
31972	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And no, th- the per- the person don't get it. I mean, this is why we did it, because when we gave them just three tasks for w- part-A_ and three tasks for part-B_ a-	no
31973	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Right.	no
31974	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
31975	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Well no, they could still choose. They just wouldn't be able to choose both zoo and say, touring the castle.	no
31976	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Exactly. This is limiting the choices, but yeah.	no
31977	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Right. O_K, sorry. But um I - I think this approach will	no
31978	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"very well work, but the person was able to look at it and say ""O_K, This is what I would actually do."""	no
31979	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
31980	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K.	no
31981	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
31982	transcript	transcript_Bed011	He was vicious.	no
31983	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K, we gotta - we gotta disallow uh - traveling to zoos and uh castles at the same time, sort of -	no
31984	transcript	transcript_Bed011	I mean there - they are significantly different, but.	no
31985	transcript	transcript_Bed011	But no, they're - I mean they're sort of - this is where tour becomes - you know tourists maybe a bit different and, um, these are just places where you - you enter um, much like here.	no
31986	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah, I guess so.	no
31987	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
31988	transcript	transcript_Bed011	But we can uh -	no
31989	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah, in fact if y- if y- if you use the right verb for each	no
31990	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"in common, like at- you know, ""attend a theater, symphony or opera"" is - is a group, and ""tour the university, castle or zoo"","	no
31991	transcript	transcript_Bed011	mm-hmm	no
31992	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"all of these d- do have this kind of ""tour"""	no
31993	transcript	transcript_Bed011	um - aspect about the way you would go to them.	no
31994	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
31995	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And uh,	no
31996	transcript	transcript_Bed011	the movie theater is probably also	no
31997	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"uh - e- is a- ""attend"""	no
31998	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Attend, yeah.	no
31999	transcript	transcript_Bed011	et cetera.	no
32000	transcript	transcript_Bed011	So it may turn out to be	no
32001	transcript	transcript_Bed011	not so many different kinds of things, and then, what one would expect is that - that the sentence types would -	no
32002	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Hmm, mm-hmm.	no
32003	transcript	transcript_Bed011	uh their responses would	no
32004	transcript	transcript_Bed011	tend to be	no
32005	transcript	transcript_Bed011	grouped	no
32006	transcript	transcript_Bed011	according to the kind of activity, you would expect.	no
32007	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Mm-hmm.	no
32008	transcript	transcript_Bed011	But I mean i- it seem that um -	no
32009	transcript	transcript_Bed011	there is a difference between going -	no
32010	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"to see something, and things like ""exchange money"" or ""dine out"" uh -"	no
32011	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Oh, absolutely. Yeah.	no
32012	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah, this is where - yeah - th- the function stuff is definitely different and the	no
32013	transcript	transcript_Bed011	getting information or g-	no
32014	transcript	transcript_Bed011	stuff - yeah.	no
32015	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K. But this is open. So since people gonna still pick something, we- we're not gonna get any significant amount of redundancy.	no
32016	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And	no
32017	transcript	transcript_Bed011	for reasons, we don't want it, really, in that sense.	no
32018	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And um	no
32019	transcript	transcript_Bed011	we would be ultimately more interested in getting all the possible ways of people	no
32020	transcript	transcript_Bed011	asking, oh, for different things with - or with a computer.	no
32021	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And so if you can think of any other sort of high level tasks a tourist may do just always - just m- mail them to us and we'll	no
32022	transcript	transcript_Bed011	sneak them into the	no
32023	transcript	transcript_Bed011	collection.	no
32024	transcript	transcript_Bed011	We're not gonna do much statistical stuff with it.	no
32025	transcript	transcript_Bed011	We don't have enough.	no
32026	transcript	transcript_Bed011	No.	no
32027	transcript	transcript_Bed011	But it seems like since we - since we are getting towards uh subject - uh fifty subjects and if we can keep it up	no
32028	transcript	transcript_Bed011	um to a - uh -	no
32029	transcript	transcript_Bed011	sort of five four-ish per week	no
32030	transcript	transcript_Bed011	rate, we may even reach the one hundred before Fey t- takes off to Chicago.	no
32031	transcript	transcript_Bed011	That means that one hundred people have to be interested.	no
32032	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Good luck.	no
32033	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
32034	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Well,	no
32035	transcript	transcript_Bed011	um,	no
32036	transcript	transcript_Bed011	these are all f- people off campus s- from campus so far, right?	no
32037	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
32038	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
32039	transcript	transcript_Bed011	So we - yeah we don't know how many we can get next door at the - uh shelter for example.	no
32040	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Hmm.	no
32041	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Uh for ten bucks, probably quite a few.	no
32042	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
32043	transcript	transcript_Bed011	That's right.	no
32044	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	yes
32045	transcript	transcript_Bed011	So, alright, so let's go - let's go back then,	no
32046	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yep.	no
32047	transcript	transcript_Bed011	to the -	no
32048	transcript	transcript_Bed011	the chart with all the decisions and stuff, and see	no
32049	transcript	transcript_Bed011	how we're doing. Do - do people think that, you know this is - is gonna -	no
32050	transcript	transcript_Bed011	um	no
32051	transcript	transcript_Bed011	cover what we need, or should we be thinking about more?	no
32052	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Okay, in terms of decision nodes?	no
32053	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yep.	no
32054	transcript	transcript_Bed011	I mean, Go-there is - is a yes or no.	no
32055	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Right?	no
32056	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yep.	no
32057	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Mm-hmm.	no
32058	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"I'm also interested in th- in this ""property"" uh line here, so if you"	no
32059	transcript	transcript_Bed011	look at -	no
32060	transcript	transcript_Bed011	sorry, look at that	no
32061	transcript	transcript_Bed011	um ,	no
32062	transcript	transcript_Bed011	timing was	no
32063	transcript	transcript_Bed011	um - I have these three. Do we need a final differentiation there?	no
32064	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Now, later on the same tour, sometimes on the next tour.	no
32065	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"What's this idea of ""next tour""? I mean -"	no
32066	transcript	transcript_Bed011	It's sort of next day, so you're doing something now	no
32067	transcript	transcript_Bed011	and you have planned to do these three four things, and you can do something immediately,	no
32068	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Mm-hmm.	no
32069	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Mm-hmm.	no
32070	transcript	transcript_Bed011	you could sort of tag it on to that tour	no
32071	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Or - O_K.	no
32072	transcript	transcript_Bed011	or you can say this is something I would do s- I wanna do sometime l-	no
32073	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K.	no
32074	transcript	transcript_Bed011	in my life,	no
32075	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K.	no
32076	transcript	transcript_Bed011	basically.	no
32077	transcript	transcript_Bed011	So - so this tour is sort of just like th- the idea of	no
32078	transcript	transcript_Bed011	current s- round of - of touristness or whatever, O_K.	no
32079	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Right.	no
32080	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah. Yeah, probably between stops back at the hotel.	no
32081	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K. Got it.	no
32082	transcript	transcript_Bed011	I mean if you - if - if you wanted precise about it, uh you know, uh - and I think that's the way tourists do organize their lives.	no
32083	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Got it.	no
32084	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Sure, sure, sure.	no
32085	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"You know, ""O_K, we'll go back to the hotel and then we'll go off and -"""	no
32086	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K.	no
32087	transcript	transcript_Bed011	So all tours - b- a tour happens only within one day?	no
32088	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yes.	no
32089	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K.	no
32090	transcript	transcript_Bed011	So the next tour will be tomorrow?	no
32091	transcript	transcript_Bed011	It -	no
32092	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Right.	no
32093	transcript	transcript_Bed011	For this.	no
32094	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K.	no
32095	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Just to be totally clear. O_K.	no
32096	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Well, my visit to Prague there were some nights where I never went back to the hotel, so whether that counts as a two-day tour or not we'll have to	no
32097	transcript	transcript_Bed011	You just spend the whole time at U_ Fleku or something, ri-	no
32098	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
32099	transcript	transcript_Bed011	I - w- we will - we will not ask you more.	no
32100	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Right.	no
32101	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Right.	no
32102	transcript	transcript_Bed011	I don't know. What is the uh - the - the English co- uh um	no
32103	transcript	transcript_Bed011	cognate if you want, for	no
32104	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
32105	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"Sort of ""We'll do it"	no
32106	transcript	transcript_Bed011	on - when you say on that d- day it means it'll never happen.	no
32107	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Right.	no
32108	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K.	no
32109	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Do you have an expression?	no
32110	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Probably you sh-	no
32111	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Not that I know of actually.	no
32112	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah, when hell - Yep, we'll do it when hell freezes over. So maybe that should be another	no
32113	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
32114	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Right.	no
32115	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
32116	transcript	transcript_Bed011	No.	no
32117	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K.	no
32118	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Um, the reason why - why do we go there in the first place	no
32119	transcript	transcript_Bed011	I_E uh - it's either uh - for sightseeing, for meeting people, for running errands, or doing business.	no
32120	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Is this the theater thing?	no
32121	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Like entertainment or something like that?	no
32122	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Entertainment is a good one in there, I think. I agree.	no
32123	transcript	transcript_Bed011	So,	no
32124	transcript	transcript_Bed011	business is supposed to uh,	no
32125	transcript	transcript_Bed011	be sort of - it - like professional type stuff, right, or something like that?	no
32126	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yep.	no
32127	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K.	no
32128	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Um.	no
32129	transcript	transcript_Bed011	I mean - this w- this is uh	no
32130	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"an old uh Johno thing. He sort of had it in there. ""Who is the - the tour- is the person?"" So it might be a tourist, it might be a business man who's using the system, who wants to sort of go to some -"	no

32132	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
32133	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah, or - or both.	no
32134	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no

32136	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yep.	no
32137	transcript	transcript_Bed011	He's there to teach a course at the business school but he also is touring around and so he may have some mixture of these things.	no
32138	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yep. Yep.	no
32139	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Mmm. Sure. Right.	no
32140	transcript	transcript_Bed011	He would -	no
32141	transcript	transcript_Bed011	What ab-	no
32142	transcript	transcript_Bed011	What do you have in mind in terms of um - socializing? What kind of activities?	no
32143	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Eh, just meeting people, basically.	no
32144	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Oh -	no
32145	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"""I want to meet someone somewhere"", which be- puts a very heavy constraint on the ""EVA"""	no
32146	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
32147	transcript	transcript_Bed011	you know, because then if you're meeting somebody at the town hall, you're not entering it usually, you're just - want to approach it.	no
32148	transcript	transcript_Bed011	So - I mean, does this capture, like, where do you put -	no
32149	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"""Exchange money"" is an errand, right? But what about uh - So, like ""Go to a movie"" is now entertainment, ""Dine out"" is -"	no
32150	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Mm-hmm	no
32151	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yep.	no
32152	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Socializing, I guess.	no
32153	transcript	transcript_Bed011	No, I- I- well, I dunno. Let - Let - well, we'll put it somewhere, but - but - um -	no
32154	transcript	transcript_Bed011	So I mean -	no
32155	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Right.	no
32156	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"I would say that if ""Dine out"" is a special c- uh - if you're doing it for that purpose then it's entertainment."	no
32157	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
32158	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"And - we'll also as y- as you'll s- further along we'll get into business about ""Well, you're - you know - this is going over a meal time, do you wanna stop for a meal or pick up food or something?"""	no
32159	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Mm-hmm.	no
32160	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And that's	no
32161	transcript	transcript_Bed011	different. That's - that's sort of part of th- that's not a destination	no
32162	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Right.	no
32163	transcript	transcript_Bed011	reason, that's sort of	no
32164	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"That goes with the ""energy depletion"" function, blech."	no
32165	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
32166	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Right, yeah.	no
32167	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"O_K, ""endpoint""."	no
32168	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"""Tourist needs food, badly"""	no
32169	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Right.	no

32171	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"""mode"", uh, I have found three, ""drive there"", ""walk there"" uh - or ""be driven"", which means bus, taxi, BART."	no
32172	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K.	no
32173	transcript	transcript_Bed011	The public transport in general is	no
32174	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
32175	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yep.	no
32176	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Obviously taxis are very different than buses, but on the other hand the system doesn't have	no
32177	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
32178	transcript	transcript_Bed011	any public transport - This - the planner system doesn't have any public transport in it yet.	no
32179	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K.	no
32180	transcript	transcript_Bed011	So this granularity would suffice, I think w- if we say the person probably, based on the utterance we- on the situation we can conclude	no
32181	transcript	transcript_Bed011	wants to drive there, walk there, or	no
32182	transcript	transcript_Bed011	use some other form of transportation.	no
32183	transcript	transcript_Bed011	H- How much of Heidelberg can you get around by public transport? I mean in terms of the interesting bits. There's lots of bits where you don't really	no
32184	transcript	transcript_Bed011	I've only ev- was there ten years ago, for a day, so I don't remember, but.	no
32185	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Mm-	no
32186	transcript	transcript_Bed011	I mean, like the - sort of the tourist-y bits - is it like -	no
32187	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Everywhere.	no
32188	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Well, you can't get to the Philosophers' Way very well, but,	no
32189	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
32190	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
32191	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K.	no
32192	transcript	transcript_Bed011	but I think other things you can, if I remember right.	no
32193	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"So is like ""biking there"" - part of like ""driving there"", or - ?"	no
32194	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah, um we actually - biking should be - should be a separate point because we have a very strong bicycle planning component.	no
32195	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Oh!	no
32196	transcript	transcript_Bed011	So.	no
32197	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Mmm g- that's good.	no
32198	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Put it in.	no
32199	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Um.	no
32200	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Bicycles c- should be in there, but,	no
32201	transcript	transcript_Bed011	will we have bic- I mean is this realistic? I mean -	no
32202	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
32203	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K, we can leave it out, I guess.	no
32204	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
32205	transcript	transcript_Bed011	We can - we can sort of uh,	no
32206	transcript	transcript_Bed011	drive -	no
32207	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"I would - I would lump it with ""walk"" because hills matter. Right? You know. Things like that."	no
32208	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
32209	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
32210	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K.	no
32211	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Skateboards	no
32212	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Right.	no
32213	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Scooters, right?	no
32214	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yep.	no
32215	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Alright.	no
32216	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"O_K, ""Length"" is um,"	no
32217	transcript	transcript_Bed011	you wanna get this over with as fast as possible,	no
32218	transcript	transcript_Bed011	you wanna use some part of what - of the time you have.	no
32219	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"They can specify ""long""."	no
32220	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Um, they can. But we should just make a decision whether we feel that they want to use some substantial or some fraction of their time.	no
32221	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Ye-	no
32222	transcript	transcript_Bed011	You know, they wanna do it so badly that they are willing to spend uh - you know the necessary and plus time.	no
32223	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Hmm.	no
32224	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And um -	no
32225	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And y-	no
32226	transcript	transcript_Bed011	you know, if we feel that they wanna do nothing but that thing then, you know, we should point out that -	no
32227	transcript	transcript_Bed011	to the planner, that they probably want to use all the time they have.	no
32228	transcript	transcript_Bed011	So, stretch out that visit for	no
32229	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Mm-hmm.	no
32230	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Wow - It seems like this would be really hard to guess.	no
32231	transcript	transcript_Bed011	that.	no
32232	transcript	transcript_Bed011	I mean, on the part of the system. It seems like it -	no
32233	transcript	transcript_Bed011	I mean you're - you're talking about rather than having the user decide this you're supposed t- we're supposed to figure it out?	no
32234	transcript	transcript_Bed011	w-	no
32235	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Th- the user can always s- say it, but it's just sort of we - we hand over these parameters if we make - if we have a feeling that they are important.	no
32236	transcript	transcript_Bed011	well-	no
32237	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Overrider	no
32238	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
32239	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Mm-hmm.	no
32240	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And that we can actually infer them to a significant de- degree, or we ask.	no
32241	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And -	no
32242	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K.	no
32243	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And par- yeah, and part of the system design is that if it looks to be important and you can't figure it out, then you ask.	no
32244	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
32245	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K.	no
32246	transcript	transcript_Bed011	But hopefully you don't ask	no
32247	transcript	transcript_Bed011	you know, a- all these things all the time. Or -	no
32248	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah. Yeah. Right. Yeah.	no
32249	transcript	transcript_Bed011	eh- so, y- but there's th- but definitely a back-off position to asking.	no
32250	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And if no - no part of the system ever comes up with the idea that this could be important,	no
32251	transcript	transcript_Bed011	no planner is ever gonna ask for it.	no
32252	transcript	transcript_Bed011	y- so - And I like the idea that, you know, sort of - Jerry pushed this idea from the very beginning, that it's part of the understanding business to sort of make a good question of what's s- sort of important in this general picture, what you need t-	no
32253	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
32254	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Mm-hmm.	no
32255	transcript	transcript_Bed011	If you wanna simulate it, for example, what parameters would you need for the simulation?	no
32256	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And,	no
32257	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Timing, uh,	no
32258	transcript	transcript_Bed011	uh, Length would definitely be part of it,	no
32259	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"""Costs"","	no
32260	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"""Little money, some money, lots of money""?"	no
32261	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Mm-hmm.	no
32262	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Actually, maybe uh F-	no
32263	transcript	transcript_Bed011	uh so, F- Yeah, O_K.	no
32264	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Hmm?	no
32265	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"You could say ""some"" in there."	no
32266	transcript	transcript_Bed011	I must say that thi-	no
32267	transcript	transcript_Bed011	this one looks a bit strange to me. Um - maybe - It seems like appropriate	no
32268	transcript	transcript_Bed011	if I go to Las Vegas.	no
32269	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Well - but I decide k- kind of how much money	no
32270	transcript	transcript_Bed011	uh I'm willing to lose.	no
32271	transcript	transcript_Bed011	But a- I as a tourist, I'll just paying what's - what's more or less is required.	no
32272	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Well, no. I think there are - there're different things where you have a ch- choice, for example,	no
32273	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Mmm.	no
32274	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
32275	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"uh this t- interacts with ""do- am I do- oh- are you willing to take a taxi?"""	no
32276	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Dinner.	no
32277	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Restaurant.	no
32278	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Or uh, you know, if - if you're going to the opera are you gonna l- look for	no
32279	transcript	transcript_Bed011	The best seat or - or -	no
32280	transcript	transcript_Bed011	the best seats or the peanut gallery or, you know, whatever?	no
32281	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Right.	no
32282	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K. So -	no
32283	transcript	transcript_Bed011	S- so I think there are a variety of things in which	no
32284	transcript	transcript_Bed011	um -	no
32285	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Tour- tourists really do have different styles eating. Another one, you know.	no
32286	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
32287	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Right, that's true.	no
32288	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Right.	no
32289	transcript	transcript_Bed011	The - what - what my sort of sentiment is they're -	no
32290	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Well, I - I once had to write a - a - a - a charter, a carter for a - a student organization. And they had - wanted me to define what the quorum is going to be.	no
32291	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And I looked at the other ones and they always said ten percent of the student body has to be present at their general meeting otherwise it's not a -	no
32292	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"And I wrote in there ""En- Enough"""	no
32293	transcript	transcript_Bed011	people have to be there.	no
32294	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And it was hotly debated, but	no
32295	transcript	transcript_Bed011	people agreed with me that everybody probably has a good feeling whether it was a farce, a joke, or whether there were enough people. And if you go to Turkey, you will find	no
32296	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
32297	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"when people go shopping, they will say ""How much cheese do you want?"" and they say ""Ah, enough."""	no
32298	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And the - and the - this used all over the place.	no
32299	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Because the person selling the cheese knows, you know, that person has two kids and you know, a husband that dislikes cheese, so this is enough.	no
32300	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Mm-hmm.	no
32301	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"And um so the middle part is always sort of the - the golden way, right? So you can s- you can be really - make it as cheap as possible, or you can say ""I want, er, you know, I don't care"""	no
32302	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Money is no object. Mm-hmm.	no
32303	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
32304	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"Money is no object, or you say ""I just want to spend enough""."	no
32305	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Mm-hmm.	no
32306	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Or the sufficient, or the- the appropriate amount.	no
32307	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
32308	transcript	transcript_Bed011	But,	no
32309	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Then again, this may turn out to be	no
32310	transcript	transcript_Bed011	insufficient for our purposes. But well,	no
32311	transcript	transcript_Bed011	this is my first guess,	no
32312	transcript	transcript_Bed011	I mean y-	no
32313	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
32314	transcript	transcript_Bed011	you know - should the route be? Should it be the easiest route, even if it's a b- little bit longer?	no
32315	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Mm-hmm.	no
32316	transcript	transcript_Bed011	No steep inclinations? Go the normal way? Whatever that again means, er - or do you - does the person wanna rough it?	no
32317	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Mm-hmm.	no
32318	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"I mean - th- so there's a couple of different ways you can interpret these things right? You know - ""I want to go there and I don't care if it's really hard."""	no
32319	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"Or if you're an extreme sport person, you know. ""I wanna go there and I insist on it being the hard way."" Right? you know, so I assume we're going for the first interpretation, right? Something like -"	no
32320	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Right.	no
32321	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Right.	no
32322	transcript	transcript_Bed011	I'll go th- I mean -	no
32323	transcript	transcript_Bed011	I'd li- I dunno. It's different from thing to -	no
32324	transcript	transcript_Bed011	No, I think he was going for the second one ar- actually.	no
32325	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah?	no
32326	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Anyway, we'll sort th- yeah, we'll sort that out.	no
32327	transcript	transcript_Bed011	I - I - O_K.	no
32328	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Right.	no
32329	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
32330	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Absolutely.	no
32331	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Well, this is all sort of	no
32332	transcript	transcript_Bed011	um, top of my head. No - no research behind that.	no
32333	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
32334	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"Um - ""Object information"", ""Do I - do I wanna know anything about that object?"" is either true or false."	no
32335	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And.	no
32336	transcript	transcript_Bed011	if I care about it being open, accessible or not,	no
32337	transcript	transcript_Bed011	I don't think there's any middle ground there.	no
32338	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Um,	no
32339	transcript	transcript_Bed011	either I wanna know where it is or not,	no
32340	transcript	transcript_Bed011	I wanna know about it's history or not,	no
32341	transcript	transcript_Bed011	or,	no
32342	transcript	transcript_Bed011	um I wanna know about	no
32343	transcript	transcript_Bed011	what it's good for or not.	no
32344	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Maybe one could put scales in there, too. So I wanna know a l-	no
32345	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah, now ob-	no
32346	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K, I'm sorry, go ahead, what were you gonna say?	no
32347	transcript	transcript_Bed011	lot about it.	no
32348	transcript	transcript_Bed011	One could put scales in there. So I wanna know a lot about the history, just a bit.	no
32349	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah, right well y- i- w- if we - w- right.	no
32350	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"So ""object"" becomes ""entity"", right?"	no
32351	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yep, that's true.	no
32352	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah, but we don't have to do it now.	no
32353	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yep.	no
32354	transcript	transcript_Bed011	That was the wrong shortcut anyhow.	no
32355	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And we think that's it, interestingly enough, that	no
32356	transcript	transcript_Bed011	um,	no
32357	transcript	transcript_Bed011	you know, th- or - or - or something very close to it is going to be uh -	no
32358	transcript	transcript_Bed011	going to be enough.	no
32359	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And -	no
32360	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Still wrong.	no
32361	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
32362	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K.	yes
32363	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K.	no
32364	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Alright, so um -	no
32365	transcript	transcript_Bed011	So I think the order of things is that	no
32366	transcript	transcript_Bed011	um,	no
32367	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Robert will clean this up a little bit, although it looks pretty good.	no
32368	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And -	no
32369	transcript	transcript_Bed011	What, well this is the part that - this is the part that needs the work.	no
32370	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Huh?	no
32371	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Right. Yeah, so - right, so - So,	no
32372	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
32373	transcript	transcript_Bed011	um	no
32374	transcript	transcript_Bed011	In parallel,	no
32375	transcript	transcript_Bed011	uh - three things are going to happen.	no
32376	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Uh Robert and Eva and Bhaskara are gonna actually -	no
32377	transcript	transcript_Bed011	build a belief-net that - that, um, has C_P_T's and, you know, tries to infer this from various kinds of information.	no
32378	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And Fey is going to start collecting data,	no
32379	transcript	transcript_Bed011	and we're gonna start thinking a- about - uh - what constructions we want to elicit.	no
32380	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And then w- go- it may iterate on	no
32381	transcript	transcript_Bed011	uh, further data collection to elicit -	no
32382	transcript	transcript_Bed011	D- Do you mean -	no
32383	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Do you mean eliciting particular constructions? Or do you mean like what kinds of things we want to get people talking about?	no
32384	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Well, yes.	no
32385	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Semantically speaking, eh?	no
32386	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Both.	no
32387	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K.	no
32388	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Uh, and -	no
32389	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Though for us, constructions are primarily semantic, right?	no
32390	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Right.	no
32391	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And -	no
32392	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Sure.	no
32393	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And so - uh -	no
32394	transcript	transcript_Bed011	I mean from my point of view I'm - I'm trying to care about the syntax, so you know -	no
32395	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Well that too, but um -	no
32396	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K.	no
32397	transcript	transcript_Bed011	You know if th- if we in - if we you know, make sure that we get them talking about temporal order.	no
32398	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
32399	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K, that would be great and if th- if they use prepositional phrases or subordinate clauses or whatever, um -	no
32400	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Mm-hmm.	no
32401	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Right. O_K.	no
32402	transcript	transcript_Bed011	W- You know, whatever form they use	no
32403	transcript	transcript_Bed011	is fine.	no
32404	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K.	no
32405	transcript	transcript_Bed011	But I - I think that probably we're gonna try to look at it as	no
32406	transcript	transcript_Bed011	you know, s- what semantic constructions d- do we - do we want them to uh do direc- you know, um,	no
32407	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K.	no
32408	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"""Caused motion"", I don't know, something like that."	no
32409	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K.	no
32410	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Uh	no
32411	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Got it.	no
32412	transcript	transcript_Bed011	But,	no
32413	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Eh- uh- this is actually a conversation you and I have to have about	no
32414	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
32415	transcript	transcript_Bed011	your thesis fantasies, and how all this fits into that.	no
32416	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Uh Yeah. O_K.	no
32417	transcript	transcript_Bed011	But uh -	no
32418	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Well, I will tell you the German tourist data.	no
32419	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K.	no
32420	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Because I have not	no
32421	transcript	transcript_Bed011	been able to dig out all the stuff out of the	no
32422	transcript	transcript_Bed011	m- ta- thirty D_V_Ds.	no
32423	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K.	no
32424	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Um -	no
32425	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Is that roughly the equivalent of - of what I've seen in English or is it -	no
32426	transcript	transcript_Bed011	If you -	no
32427	transcript	transcript_Bed011	No, not at all. Dialogues.	no

32434	transcript	transcript_Bed011	A little bit of data, I -	no

32445	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And um -	no
32446	transcript	transcript_Bed011	the - see this - this - this - uh - ontology node is probably something that I will	no
32447	transcript	transcript_Bed011	try to expand. Once we have the full ontology A_P_I,	no
32448	transcript	transcript_Bed011	what can we expect to get from the ontology?	no
32449	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And hopefully you can sort of also	no
32450	transcript	transcript_Bed011	try to find out, you know, sooner or later	no
32451	transcript	transcript_Bed011	in the course of the summer what we can expect to get from the discourse that might, you know - or the - not the discourse, the utterance	no

32453	transcript	transcript_Bed011	mm-hmm.	no
32454	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Mm-hmm.	no
32455	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Right.	no
32456	transcript	transcript_Bed011	as it were, uh, in terms of uh -	no
32457	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Right, but we're	no
32458	transcript	transcript_Bed011	No, no, no, no, no. Uh, this is -	no
32459	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Right, Right.	no
32460	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K.	no
32461	transcript	transcript_Bed011	We	no
32462	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yes.	no
32463	transcript	transcript_Bed011	By the end of the summer, too.	no
32464	transcript	transcript_Bed011	No.	no
32465	transcript	transcript_Bed011	No.	no
32466	transcript	transcript_Bed011	No.	no
32467	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Uh -	no
32468	transcript	transcript_Bed011	But it's sort of - it's -	no
32469	transcript	transcript_Bed011	He's g- he's hoping to do this for his masters' thesis s- by a year from now.	no
32470	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Right.	no
32471	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Hmm.	no
32472	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Still, pretty formidable actually.	no
32473	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Eh- absolutely.	no
32474	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Uh - limited. I mean, you know, the idea is - is, Well, the hope is that the parser itself is, uh, pretty robust.	no
32475	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
32476	transcript	transcript_Bed011	But it's not popular - it's only p- only -	no
32477	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Right, Right. Existence proof, you know. Set up the	no
32478	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Right.	no
32479	transcript	transcript_Bed011	It's only popula-	no
32480	transcript	transcript_Bed011	infrastructure, yeah.	no
32481	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Right.	yes
32482	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Um sometime, I have to talk to some subset of the people in this group, at least about um	no
32483	transcript	transcript_Bed011	what sort of constructions I'm looking for. I mean, you know obviously like just	no
32484	transcript	transcript_Bed011	again, looking at this one uh thing, you know, I saw y- things from -	no
32485	transcript	transcript_Bed011	sort of as general as argument structure constructions. Oh, you know, I have to do Verb Phrase. I have to do uh - uh - unbounded dependencies, you know, which have a variety of constructions in - uh - uh - instantiate that.	no
32486	transcript	transcript_Bed011	On the other hand I have to have, you know, there's particular	no
32487	transcript	transcript_Bed011	uh,	no
32488	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"fixed expressions, or semi-fixed expressions like ""Get"" plus path expression for, you know, ""how d- ho- how do I get there?"", ""How do I get in?"", ""How do I get away?"" and all that kind of stuff."	no
32489	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Mm-hmm.	no
32490	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Right.	no
32491	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Um, so there's a variety of sort of different	no
32492	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Absolutely.	no
32493	transcript	transcript_Bed011	sorts of constructions and it - you know it's - it's sort of like anything goes. Like -	no
32494	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K, so this is - I think we're gonna mainly work on with George.	no
32495	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K.	no
32496	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K, and hi- let me f-	no
32497	transcript	transcript_Bed011	th - say what I think is - is - so the idea is - uh - first of all	no
32498	transcript	transcript_Bed011	I misspoke when I said	no
32499	transcript	transcript_Bed011	we thought you should do the constructions. Cause apparently for a linguist that means to do completely and perfectly.	no
32500	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"So what I - yeah, O_K, - So what - what I meant was ""Do a first cut at""."	no
32501	transcript	transcript_Bed011	er - that's what	no
32502	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah, yeah.	no
32503	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K, Because uh - we do wanna get them r- u-	no
32504	transcript	transcript_Bed011	perfectly - but I think we're gonna have to do a first cut at a lot of them to see how they interact.	no
32505	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Of course.	no
32506	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Right, exactly.	no
32507	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Now it - w- we talked about this before, right. And I - I me- it would- it would be completely out of the question to really do more than, say, like,	no
32508	transcript	transcript_Bed011	oh I don't know, ten, over the summer, but uh, but you know obviously we need to get	no
32509	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
32510	transcript	transcript_Bed011	sort of a general view of what things look like, so yeah.	no
32511	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Right. So the idea is going to be	no
32512	transcript	transcript_Bed011	to do - sort of like Nancy did in some of the- er these papers where you do enough of them so you can go from top to bottom - so you can do f- you know,	no
32513	transcript	transcript_Bed011	f- f- uh - have a complete story ov- of s- of some piece of dialogue.	no
32514	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Mm-hmm.	no
32515	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And that's gonna be much more useful	no
32516	transcript	transcript_Bed011	than having all of the clausal constructions and nothing else, or - or - or something like that. So that the - the trick is going to be	no
32517	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah. Sure.	no
32518	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
32519	transcript	transcript_Bed011	t- to take this and pick a - some sort of lattice	no
32520	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Mm-hmm.	no
32521	transcript	transcript_Bed011	of constructions, so- some lexical and some phrasal, and - and, you know, whatever you need in order to	no
32522	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Mm-hmm.	no
32523	transcript	transcript_Bed011	uh, be able to then,	no
32524	transcript	transcript_Bed011	uh, by hand,	no
32525	transcript	transcript_Bed011	you know, explain,	no
32526	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Mm-hmm.	no
32527	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
32528	transcript	transcript_Bed011	some fraction of the utterances.	no
32529	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And so, exactly which ones will partly depend on your research interests and a bunch of other things.	no
32530	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Mm-hmm.	no
32531	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Sure.	no
32532	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K. But I mean in terms of the s- th- sort of level of	no
32533	transcript	transcript_Bed011	uh - of analysis, you know,	no
32534	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"these don't necessarily have to be more complex than like the ""Out of"" construction in the B_C_P paper where it's just like, you know, half a page on each one or something."	no
32535	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Correct.	no
32536	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Oh yeah - yeah. V- a half a page is - is what we'd like.	no
32537	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
32538	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And if - if there's something that really requires a lot more than that then it does and we have to do it, but -	no
32539	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
32540	transcript	transcript_Bed011	For the first cut, that should be fine, yeah.	no
32541	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
32542	transcript	transcript_Bed011	We could sit down and think of sort of the -	no
32543	transcript	transcript_Bed011	the ideal speaker utterances, and I mean	no
32544	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Mm-hmm.	no
32545	transcript	transcript_Bed011	two	no
32546	transcript	transcript_Bed011	or three that follow each other, so,	no
32547	transcript	transcript_Bed011	where we can also sort of, once we have everything up and running,	no
32548	transcript	transcript_Bed011	show the tremendous, insane inferencing capabilities of our system.	no
32549	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Mm-hmm.	no
32550	transcript	transcript_Bed011	So, you know, as - as the SmartKom people have. This is sort of their standard	no
32551	transcript	transcript_Bed011	demo dialogue, which is, you know, what the system survives and nothing but	no
32552	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Mm-hmm.	no
32553	transcript	transcript_Bed011	that. Um, we could also sor- sort of have the	no
32554	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Mm-hmm.	no
32555	transcript	transcript_Bed011	o- our sample sentences, the ideal sentences where we have complete	no
32556	transcript	transcript_Bed011	construction coverage	no
32557	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Mm-hmm.	no
32558	transcript	transcript_Bed011	and, sort of,	no
32559	transcript	transcript_Bed011	they match nicely. So the -	no
32560	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"the ""How do I get to X_?"", you know, that's definitely gonna be"	no
32561	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
32562	transcript	transcript_Bed011	uh, a major one.	no
32563	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah. That's about six times in this little one here, so uh,	no
32564	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Right.	no
32565	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yep.	no
32566	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"""Where is X_?"" might be another one which is not too complicated."	no
32567	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
32568	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Mm-hmm.	no
32569	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"And um ""Tell me something about X_."""	no
32570	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
32571	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And hey, that's - that's already covering	no
32572	transcript	transcript_Bed011	eighty percent of the system's functionality.	no
32573	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Ye-	no
32574	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Right, but it's not covering eighty percent of the intellectual interest.	no
32575	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
32576	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"No, we can w- throw in an ""Out of Film"" construction if you want to, but -"	no
32577	transcript	transcript_Bed011	No, no, no. Well the - th- the thing is there's a lot that needs to be done	no
32578	transcript	transcript_Bed011	to get this right.	no
32579	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K, I th-	no
32580	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K.	no
32581	transcript	transcript_Bed011	We done?	yes
32582	transcript	transcript_Bed011	I have one bit of news. Um,	no
32583	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Good.	no
32584	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Good.	no
32585	transcript	transcript_Bed011	the action planner guy has wrote -	no
32586	transcript	transcript_Bed011	has written a -	no
32587	transcript	transcript_Bed011	a p-	no
32588	transcript	transcript_Bed011	lengthy - proposal on how he wants to do the action planning.	no
32589	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And I responded to him, also rather lengthy, how he should do the action planning.	no
32590	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And -	no
32591	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"""Action planning"" meaning ""Discourse Modeling""?"	no
32592	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yes. And I tacked on a little paragraph about the fact that the whole world calls that	no
32593	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Right.	no
32594	transcript	transcript_Bed011	module a dis- disc- dialogue manager, and	no
32595	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Right.	no
32596	transcript	transcript_Bed011	wouldn't it make sense to do this here too?	no
32597	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And also Rainer M- Malaka is going to be visiting us shortly, most likely in the beginning of June.	no
32598	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Uh-huh, I'll be gone.	no
32599	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah. He- he's just in a conference somewhere and he is just swinging through town.	no
32600	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Sure, O_K.	no
32601	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And um -	no
32602	transcript	transcript_Bed011	m- making me incapable of going to N_A_A_C_L,	no
32603	transcript	transcript_Bed011	for which I had funding.	no
32604	transcript	transcript_Bed011	But.	no
32605	transcript	transcript_Bed011	No, no Pittsburg this year.	no
32606	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Hmm.	no
32607	transcript	transcript_Bed011	S-	no
32608	transcript	transcript_Bed011	When is the uh- Santa Barbara? Who is going to? uh- should a lot of people.	no
32609	transcript	transcript_Bed011	That's something I will - would - sort of enjoy.	no
32610	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Probably should go.	no
32611	transcript	transcript_Bed011	That was -	no
32612	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yep.	no
32613	transcript	transcript_Bed011	How much does it cost?	no
32614	transcript	transcript_Bed011	There's	no
32615	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Uh,	no
32616	transcript	transcript_Bed011	probably we can uh - pay for it.	no
32617	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K.	no
32618	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Um a student rate shouldn't be very high.	no
32619	transcript	transcript_Bed011	So, if we all decide it's a good idea for you to go then you'll - we'll pay for it.	no
32620	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Right. Sure.	no
32621	transcript	transcript_Bed011	I mean I - I don't have a feeling one way or the other at the moment, but it probably is.	no
32622	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K.	no
32623	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K, great.	no
32624	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Thanks.	yes
