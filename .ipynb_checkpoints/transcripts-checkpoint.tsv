131	transcript	transcript_Bed003	It was a long time ago.	no
132	transcript	transcript_Bed003	There's a lot of those.	no
133	transcript	transcript_Bed003	But if you looked at it real close, you could see the - the in- intricacy of the -	no
134	transcript	transcript_Bed003	of the walls.	no
135	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K. So that count as - counts as a nice wall.	no
136	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right.	no
137	transcript	transcript_Bed003	The - O_K.	no
138	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
139	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right.	no
140	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Something you want to inspect at close range  because it's interesting. O_K.	no
141	transcript	transcript_Bed003	The -	no
142	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Exactly.	no
143	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Hmm.	no
144	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Robert?	no
145	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"Well there - there is a term  that's often used. That's ""saliency"", or the ""salience"" of an object."	no
146	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"And I was just wondering whether that's the same as what you describe as ""landmark-iness""."	no
147	transcript	transcript_Bed003	But it's really  not.  I mean an object can be  very  salient but	no
148	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Hmm.	no
149	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Not a landmark at all.	no
150	transcript	transcript_Bed003	not a landmark at all.	no
151	transcript	transcript_Bed003	There's landmark for um, touristic reasons and landmark for I don't know navigational reasons or something.	no
152	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right.	no
153	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yep.	no
154	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah, we meant, uh, touristic reasons.	no
155	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
156	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
157	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Hmm.	no
158	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right.	no
159	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
160	transcript	transcript_Bed003	but you can imagine maybe wanting the oth- both kinds of things there for different um, goals.	no
161	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Hmm.	no
162	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
163	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right.	no
164	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right?	no
165	transcript	transcript_Bed003	But -	no
166	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
167	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Tourist-y landmarks also happen to be -	no
168	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Wouldn't - couldn't they also be -	no
169	transcript	transcript_Bed003	They're not exclusive groups, are they?	no
170	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Like	no
171	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Or it can be als-	no
172	transcript	transcript_Bed003	non-tourist-y landmarks and	no
173	transcript	transcript_Bed003	They're not mutually exclusive?	no
174	transcript	transcript_Bed003	direct navigational - Yeah.	no
175	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right. Right. Definitely.	no
176	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
177	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K, So our initial idea was not very satisfying,	no
178	transcript	transcript_Bed003	because -	no
179	transcript	transcript_Bed003	uh our initial idea was basically all the features pointing to the output node.	no
180	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Uh.	no
181	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So, a big flat structure. Right?	no
182	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right.	no
183	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yep.	no
184	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And uh, so we -	no
185	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Reasons being,	no
186	transcript	transcript_Bed003	you know,	no
187	transcript	transcript_Bed003	it'd be a pain to set up all the probabilities	no
188	transcript	transcript_Bed003	for that.	no
189	transcript	transcript_Bed003	If we moved onto the next step and	no
190	transcript	transcript_Bed003	did learning of some sort,	no
191	transcript	transcript_Bed003	uh according Bhaskara we'd be handicapped.	no
192	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I don't know	no
193	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Well usually, I mean, you know, N_ -	no
194	transcript	transcript_Bed003	belief-nets very well.	no
195	transcript	transcript_Bed003	If you have N_ features, then it's two to the N_ -  or exponential in N_.	no
196	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And they wouldn't look pretty.	no
197	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So.	no
198	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah, they'd all be like pointing to the one node.	no
199	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
200	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Uh.	no
201	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So then our next idea was to add a middle layer, right?	no
202	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So the thinking behind that was	no
203	transcript	transcript_Bed003	we have the features that we've drawn  from the communication of some -	no
204	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Like, the someone s-	no
205	transcript	transcript_Bed003	The person at the screen is trying to communicate some abstract idea, like	no
206	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"""I'm -"""	no
207	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"the - the abstract idea being ""I am a tourist I want to go  to this place."""	no
208	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right?	no
209	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So  we're gonna set up  features along the lines of where they want to go and	no
210	transcript	transcript_Bed003	what they've said previously and whatnot. And then we have	no
211	transcript	transcript_Bed003	the means	no
212	transcript	transcript_Bed003	that they should use. Right?	no
213	transcript	transcript_Bed003	but the middle	no
214	transcript	transcript_Bed003	thing,	no
215	transcript	transcript_Bed003	we were thinking along the lines of maybe trying to	no
216	transcript	transcript_Bed003	figure out,	no
217	transcript	transcript_Bed003	like, the concept of whether they're a tourist	no
218	transcript	transcript_Bed003	or  whether they're running an errand or something like that along those lines.	no
219	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Or -	no
220	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yes, we could-	no
221	transcript	transcript_Bed003	things we couldn't extract the - from the data, the hidden variables.  Yes, good.	no
222	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So then the hidden variables - hair- variables we came up with	no
223	transcript	transcript_Bed003	were whether	no
224	transcript	transcript_Bed003	someone was on a tour, running an errand, or whether they were in a hurry,	no
225	transcript	transcript_Bed003	because	no
226	transcript	transcript_Bed003	we were thinking uh,	no
227	transcript	transcript_Bed003	if they were in a hurry there'd be less likely to -	no
228	transcript	transcript_Bed003	like -	no
229	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Want to do Vista, right?  Because  if you want to view things you wouldn't be in a hurry.	no
230	transcript	transcript_Bed003	or th-	no
231	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right.	no
232	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Or they might be more likely to be using the place that they want to go to as a -	no
233	transcript	transcript_Bed003	like a  navigational point to go to another place.	no
234	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
235	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Whether the destination was their final destination, whether the destination was closed. Those are all -	no
236	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And then	no
237	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"""Let's look at the belief-net""  O_K. So that means that I should switch to the  other program."	no
238	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Um right now it's still kind of  in a toy  version of it, because	no
239	transcript	transcript_Bed003	we didn't know the probabilities of -  or -	no
240	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Well I'll talk about it when I get the picture up.	no
241	transcript	transcript_Bed003	No one knows it.	no
242	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
243	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So this right - what we -	no
244	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Let's see.  What happens if I maximize this?	no
245	transcript	transcript_Bed003	There  we go.	no
246	transcript	transcript_Bed003	But uh -	no
247	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So.	no
248	transcript	transcript_Bed003	The mode  basically has three different  outputs.	no
249	transcript	transcript_Bed003	The  probability   - whether the probability of a Vista, Tango, or Enter.	no
250	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Um -	no
251	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"The ""context"", we simplified. Basically it's just the businessman,"	no
252	transcript	transcript_Bed003	the tourist, unknown.	no
253	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"""Verb used"" is actually"	no
254	transcript	transcript_Bed003	personally amusing	no
255	transcript	transcript_Bed003	mainly because it's - it's just	no
256	transcript	transcript_Bed003	whether the verb is a Tango verb, an Enter verb, or a  Vista verb.	no
257	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah, that one needs a lot of -	no
258	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And are those mutually exclusive sets? Right. Got it. Uh-huh.	no
259	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Not at all. That's - that - that needs a lot of work. But uh   that would've made the  probably  significantly be more complicated to enter, so we decided that for the purposes of this  it'd be simpler to just have three verbs.	no
260	transcript	transcript_Bed003	No.	no
261	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
262	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Simple.	no
263	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
264	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Stab at it. Yep.	no
265	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right.	no
266	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Um -	no
267	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Why don't you mention things about this, Bhaskara, that I am -	no
268	transcript	transcript_Bed003	not - that are not coming to my mind right now.	no
269	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K, so - Yeah, so note the four nodes down there, the - sort of, the things that are not directly extracted.	no
270	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"Actually, the five things. The ""closed"" is also not directly extracted I guess,  from the uh -"	no
271	transcript	transcript_Bed003	From the  utterance?	no
272	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Well i- it's - it's so-	no
273	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Hmm.	no
274	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"Actually, no, wait. It is. O_K, ""closed"" sort of is."	no
275	transcript	transcript_Bed003	it sort of is because it's - because have the -	no
276	transcript	transcript_Bed003	the time of day and the close- it just had the -	no
277	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right,  so f-	no
278	transcript	transcript_Bed003	er  and what time it closed.	no
279	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right, but the other ones, the final destination, the whether they're doing business, whether they're in a hurry, and whether they're tourists, that kind of thing is all uh  sort of - you know probabilistically depends on the other things. Yeah.	no
280	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Inferred from the other ones?	no
281	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
282	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And the mode, you know, depends on all those things only.	no
283	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah the -	no
284	transcript	transcript_Bed003	the actual parse is somewhere	no
285	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"Yeah. So we haven't uh, managed - Like we don't have nodes for ""discourse"" and ""parse"", although like in some sense they are parts of this belief-net. But uh -"	no
286	transcript	transcript_Bed003	up around in here.	no
287	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
288	transcript	transcript_Bed003	The idea is that we just extract those features from them, so we don't actually have a node for the entire parse, because we'd never do inference on it anyway, so.	no
289	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
290	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right.	no
291	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"So some of the - the top row of things -  What's - what's ""Disc admission fee""?"	no
292	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"whether they discuss the admission fees. So we looked at the data and in a lot of data people were saying things like  ""Can I get to this place?""

293	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Oh.	no
294	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Uh-huh.	no
295	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right.	no
296	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K. I see.	no
297	transcript	transcript_Bed003	There were - there'd be  other  things besides just the admission fee,	no
298	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
299	transcript	transcript_Bed003	but	no
300	transcript	transcript_Bed003	you know,	no
301	transcript	transcript_Bed003	we didn't have -	no
302	transcript	transcript_Bed003	That was like our example.	no
303	transcript	transcript_Bed003	That was the  initial one that we found.	no
304	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
305	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K. So there are certain cues that are very strong   either  lexical or topic-based um, concept cues	no
306	transcript	transcript_Bed003	From the discourse that -	no
307	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
308	transcript	transcript_Bed003	for one of those.	no
309	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And then in that second row  or whatever that row of Time of Day through that -	no
310	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So all of those -	no
311	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Some of them come from the utterance  and some of them are sort of	no
312	transcript	transcript_Bed003	either world knowledge or situational  things. Right? So that you have no distinction between those and  @@  O_K.	no
313	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right.	no
314	transcript	transcript_Bed003	One, uh -	no

319	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah, I m- I mean -	no
320	transcript	transcript_Bed003	One thing - uh -	no
321	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah. They're - they're are a  couple  of more things. I mean	no
322	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Uh.	no
323	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I  would  actually suggest we go through this one more time so we - we all	no
324	transcript	transcript_Bed003	uh, agree on what - what the meaning of these things is at the moment and maybe  what changes	no
325	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah, th-	no
326	transcript	transcript_Bed003	we -	no
327	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K. so one thing I - I'm	no

329	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So one	no

331	transcript	transcript_Bed003	by doing the layers like this,	no

348	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Why is the landmark -	no
349	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K. The landmark is facing to the tourists.	no
350	transcript	transcript_Bed003	That's because we're talking about landmarks as touristic landmarks not	no

352	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no

358	transcript	transcript_Bed003	cue.	no
359	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
360	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Then -	no
361	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah, that would be  whatever building they referred to.	no
362	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Prosody.	no
363	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"Right. So let's see. The variables. Disc- ""admission fee"" is a binary thing, ""time of day"" is like morning, afternoon, night. Is that the deal?"	no
364	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
365	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
366	transcript	transcript_Bed003	That's how we have it currently set up, but it could be,  you know,	no
367	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yep.	no
368	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
369	transcript	transcript_Bed003	based upon hour or  dis- we could  discrete   it - des- descret-ize it.	no
370	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
371	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Whatever granularity. Uh-huh.	no
372	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
373	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
374	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
375	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah. Normally context will include a huge amount of information, but um, we are just using the particular  part of the context which consists of the switch that they flick to indicate whether they're a tourist or not, I guess.	no
376	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yep.	no
377	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K. So that's given in their input. Right?	no
378	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right.	no
379	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So - Right, so it's not really all of context. Similarly prosody is not all of prosody but simply  for our purposes whether or not they appear tense or relaxed.	no
380	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
381	transcript	transcript_Bed003	that's very nice, huh?	no
382	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
383	transcript	transcript_Bed003	The - the - So the context is a switch between tourist or non-tourist? Or also unknown?	no
384	transcript	transcript_Bed003	and	no
385	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Or un-  unknown, yeah.	no
386	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah. Unknown, right?	no
387	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
388	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So final dest-	no
389	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So it seems like that would really help you for doing business versus tourist,	no
390	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Which is th- Which one?	no
391	transcript	transcript_Bed003	but  O_K. so the the context being um,	no
392	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"e- I don't know if that question's sort of in general, ""are you -"""	no
393	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I mean the - ar- ar- are do they allow business people to be doing non-business things at the moment?	no
394	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah, it does.	no
395	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K. So then you just have some probabilities over - O_K. - over which which of those it is.	no
396	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Everything is probablistic, and -	no
397	transcript	transcript_Bed003	There's always -	no
398	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
399	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Um, right. So then landmark is -	no
400	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"Oh, sorry. ""Verb used"" is like, right now we only have three values, but in general they would be a probability distribution over all verbs."	no
401	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
402	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Rather, let me rephrase that. It - it can take values  in the set of all verbs, that they could possibly use.	no
403	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
404	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"Um ""nice walls"" is binary, ""closed"" is binary ""final destination"", again - Yeah, all those are binary I guess."	no
405	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"And ""mode"" is one of three things."	no
406	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So, the - the middle layer is also binary? No.	no
407	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah, anything with a question mark after it in that picture is a binary node.	no
408	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Uh.	no
409	transcript	transcript_Bed003	It -	no
410	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah. But all those things without question marks are also binary. Right?	no
411	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Which things?	no
412	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
413	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Nice walls?	no
414	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Wi-	no
415	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"Oh. ""Nice walls"" is uh - something that we extract from our world knowledge."	no
416	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
417	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah, a- Oh yeah. Sorry. It is binary.	no
418	transcript	transcript_Bed003	It is binary but it doesn't have question mark because it's extracted.  Yeah.	no
419	transcript	transcript_Bed003	That's true.	no
420	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah. O_K, I see your point.	no
421	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah. O_K. I - I gotcha.	no
422	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Uh-huh.	no
423	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"Yeah, similarly ""closed"", I guess."	no
424	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So we can either be in a hurry or not, but we cannot be in a medium hurry at the moment?	no
425	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Well, we-	no
426	transcript	transcript_Bed003	To do that we would add another uh - value for that.	no
427	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm. O_K.	no
428	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"And that would require s- updating the probability distribution for ""mode"" as well."	no
429	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
430	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Because it would now have to like uh - take that possibility into account.	no
431	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
432	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Take a conti-	no
433	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
434	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So um, of course this will happen when we think more about the kinds of verbs that are used in each cases but you can imagine that it's verb plus various other things	no
435	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah, yeah.	no
436	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
437	transcript	transcript_Bed003	that are also not in the bottom layer that would - that would help you -	no
438	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Like it's a conjunction of, I don't know, you know, the verb used and some other stuff that - that would   determine - Yeah. Exactly.	no
439	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right. Other syntactic information you mean? Yeah.	no
440	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Um.	no
441	transcript	transcript_Bed003	well the - the - sort of the landmark is - is sort of the object right? the argument in a sense?	no
442	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Usually. I - I don't know if that's always the case I - I guess haven't looked at the data as much as you guys have. So. Um.	no
443	transcript	transcript_Bed003	that's always warping on something - some entity, and um -	no
444	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
445	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
446	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Uh maybe at this stage we will - we do want to - uh sort of get - uh modifiers	no
447	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Hmm.	no
448	transcript	transcript_Bed003	in there because they may also tell us whether the person is in a hurry or not	no
449	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
450	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah. I want to get to the church quickly, and uh -	no
451	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
452	transcript	transcript_Bed003	That would be a cue.	no
453	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah, right.	no
454	transcript	transcript_Bed003	what's the fastest way	no
455	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah, correct.	no
456	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
457	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Um.	no
458	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right. Excellent.	no
459	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Do we have anything else to say about this?	no
460	transcript	transcript_Bed003	We can do a  little  demo.	no
461	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Oh the- Yeah, we could.	no
462	transcript	transcript_Bed003	But the demo doesn't work very well.	no
463	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
464	transcript	transcript_Bed003	No, then it wouldn't be a demo	no
465	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I mean -	no
466	transcript	transcript_Bed003	We can do a demo in the sense that we can um,	no
467	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I was just gonna s-	no
468	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Observe nodes.	no
469	transcript	transcript_Bed003	just ob- observe the fact that this will, in fact do inference. So we can, you know, set some of the uh nodes and then	no
470	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah. Go ahead.	no
471	transcript	transcript_Bed003	try to find the probability of other nodes.	no
472	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
473	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Dat-dat-dah.	no
474	transcript	transcript_Bed003	What should I observe?	no
475	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Just se- set a few of them. You don't have to do the whole thing that we did last time. Just like uh,	no
476	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
477	transcript	transcript_Bed003	maybe the fact that they use a certain verb - Actually forget the verb.	no
478	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
479	transcript	transcript_Bed003	just uh -	no
480	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I don't know, say they discussed the admission fee -	no
481	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
482	transcript	transcript_Bed003	and uh -  the place has nice walls	no
483	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I love nice walls, O_K?	no
484	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I'm a big fan.	no
485	transcript	transcript_Bed003	it's starting to grow on me	no
486	transcript	transcript_Bed003	and it's night.	no
487	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And the time of day is night?	no
488	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah, no wait. That - that doesn't uh - it's not really consistent. They  don't  discuss the admission fee.  Make that false.	no
489	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Alright.	no
490	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And it's night.	no
491	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Oh, they  -	no
492	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
493	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Oh whoops.  I forgot to uh -	no
494	transcript	transcript_Bed003	That didn't work.	no
495	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Ach!	no
496	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I'd like to do that again.	no
497	transcript	transcript_Bed003	One thing that bugs me about JavaBayes is you have to click that  and  do this.	no
498	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah. That seems kind of redundant but.	no
499	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
500	transcript	transcript_Bed003	That all you want?	no
501	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yes.	no
502	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
503	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So let's see. I want	no
504	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"""Go"" and, right, ""query""."	no
505	transcript	transcript_Bed003	to query, right?	no
506	transcript	transcript_Bed003	the mode.	no
507	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K, and then on here -	no
508	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So let's see.	no
509	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So that  is the probability that they're Entering, Vista-ing or Tango-ing. And uh -	no
510	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
511	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
512	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"So slightly  biased  toward ""Tango""ing"	no
513	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
514	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
515	transcript	transcript_Bed003	If it's night time,  they have  not  discussed admission fee, and the n- walls are nice. So, yeah.	no
516	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I guess that  sort of makes sense.	no
517	transcript	transcript_Bed003	The reason I say the  demo doesn't work very well is yesterday we uh -	no
518	transcript	transcript_Bed003	observed everything in favor of	no
519	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"taking a tour, and it came up as ""Tango"","	no
520	transcript	transcript_Bed003	right?  Over and over again.	no
521	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So.	no
522	transcript	transcript_Bed003	We couldn't -	no
523	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Uh-huh.	no
524	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"we couldn't figure out how to turn it off of ""Tango""."	no
525	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Huh!	no
526	transcript	transcript_Bed003	It loves the Tango.	no
527	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Um.	no
528	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Well, that's obviously just to do with our probabilities. Like,	no
529	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah, yeah.	no
530	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
531	transcript	transcript_Bed003	we totally hand-tuned the probabilities, right. We were like	no
532	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
533	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"""hmm, well if the person does this and this and this, let's say forty percent for this, fifty per-"" Like, you know."	no
534	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So obviously that's gonna happen.	no
535	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right.	no
536	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
537	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah but it - it	no
538	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"Maybe the bias toward ""Tango""ing was yours, then?"	no
539	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah, that's - that's at -	no
540	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah. It's - So we have to like fit the probabilities.	no
541	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Spent my youth practicing the   tango de la muerte.	no
542	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So, the real case?	no
543	transcript	transcript_Bed003	However you know, it -	no
544	transcript	transcript_Bed003	The purpose was not really, at  this  stage, to come up with meaningful probabilities	no
545	transcript	transcript_Bed003	but to get thinking about that hidden middle layer.	no
546	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
547	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And so th-	no
548	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And -	no
549	transcript	transcript_Bed003	We would actually -	no
550	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I guess once we look at the data more we'll get more hidden  nodes,	no
551	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
552	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
553	transcript	transcript_Bed003	but	no
554	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I'd like to see more.	no
555	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Not because it would  expedite the probabilities,	no
556	transcript	transcript_Bed003	cuz it wouldn't.	no
557	transcript	transcript_Bed003	It would actually slow that down tremendously.	no
558	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Um. Well, yeah, I guess.  Not that much though. Only a  little early .	no
559	transcript	transcript_Bed003	But.	no
560	transcript	transcript_Bed003	No, I think we should have uh - exponentially more	no
561	transcript	transcript_Bed003	middle nodes than features we've extracted.	no
562	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
563	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I'm ju- I'm just jo-	no

592	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"So the ""tourists"" node  should be  um,  very  consistent with the context node. Right? If you say that's more their -"	no
593	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah,  I think this context node is a bit of a -	no
594	transcript	transcript_Bed003	in general what their background is.	no
595	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I don't know, like in d-	no
596	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Uh -	no
597	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Do we  wanna have -	no
598	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Like it's -	no
599	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Are you assuming that or not? Like is that to be -	no
600	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I mean if that's accurate then that would determine tourist node.	no
601	transcript	transcript_Bed003	If the context were to set one way or another, that like strongly uh	no
602	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
603	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"um, says something about whether - whether or not they're tourists. So what's interesting is when it's not - when it's set to ""unknown""."	no
604	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
605	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
606	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"We- what set the - they set the context to ""unknown""?"	no
607	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
608	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
609	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right now we haven't observed it, so I guess it's sort of averaging over all those three possibilities.	no
610	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
611	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
612	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right.	no
613	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"But yes, you can set it to un- ""unknown""."	no
614	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And if we now do -	no
615	transcript	transcript_Bed003	leave everything else	no
616	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Oops.	no
617	transcript	transcript_Bed003	as is	no
618	transcript	transcript_Bed003	the results should be the same, right?	no
619	transcript	transcript_Bed003	No.	no
620	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Well no, because we -	no
621	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Th- the way we set the probabilities	no
622	transcript	transcript_Bed003	might not have -	no
623	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah, it's - it's an - it's an issue, right? Like -	no
624	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Pretty  much the same?	no
625	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah, it is.	no
626	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So the issue is that um	no
627	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"in belief-nets, it's not common to do what we did of like having, you know, a d- bunch of values and then ""unknown"" as an actual value."	no
628	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
629	transcript	transcript_Bed003	What's common is you just like don't observe the variable, right, and then just marginalizes -	no
630	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
631	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yep.	no
632	transcript	transcript_Bed003	But uh -	no
633	transcript	transcript_Bed003	We didn't do this because we felt that there'd -	no
634	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I guess we were thinking in terms of a switch that actually -	no
635	transcript	transcript_Bed003	We were thi- Yeah,	no
636	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
637	transcript	transcript_Bed003	We were th-	no
638	transcript	transcript_Bed003	But uh - I don't know y- what the right thing is to do for that. I'm not -	no
639	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I don't know if I totally am happy with  the way it is.	no
640	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Why don't we -	no
641	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Can we, um -	no
642	transcript	transcript_Bed003	How long would it take to - to add another  node on the observatory and, um, play around with it?	no
643	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Another node on what?	no
644	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Uh, well it depends on how many things it's linked to.	no
645	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Let's just say make it really simple. If we create  something that for example would be um -	no
646	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So th- some things can be landmarks in your sense	no
647	transcript	transcript_Bed003	but  they  can never be entered? So for example s- a statue.	no
648	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Good point.	no
649	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah?	no
650	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right.	no
651	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
652	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So	no
653	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"maybe we wanna have ""landmark"""	no
654	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"meaning  now "" enterable  landmark"""	no
655	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah, that's true.	no
656	transcript	transcript_Bed003	versus, um	no
657	transcript	transcript_Bed003	something that's simply just a vista point, for example.	no
658	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah?	no
659	transcript	transcript_Bed003	uh, a statue or um -	no
660	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"So basically it's addressing a variable that's ""enterable or not"".  So like an ""enterable, question mark""."	no
661	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Also -	no
662	transcript	transcript_Bed003	you know, didn't we have a  size as one?	no
663	transcript	transcript_Bed003	What?	no
664	transcript	transcript_Bed003	The size of the landmark.	no
665	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Um. Not when we were doing this, but I guess at some point we did.	no
666	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Cuz if it's -	no
667	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
668	transcript	transcript_Bed003	For some reason I had that -	no
669	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K, that was a thought that I had at one point but then went away.	no
670	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So you want to have a - a node for like whether or not it can be entered?	no
671	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Well,	no
672	transcript	transcript_Bed003	for example, if we include that, yeah?	no
673	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
674	transcript	transcript_Bed003	um, accessibility or something, yeah?	no
675	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Hmm.	no
676	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"""Is it - Can it be entered?"""	no
677	transcript	transcript_Bed003	then of course, this is  sort of binary as well.	no
678	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
679	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And then um, there's also the question whether it  may  be entered.	no
680	transcript	transcript_Bed003	In the sense that,	no
681	transcript	transcript_Bed003	you know, if it's  Tom - the house of Tom Cruise,	no
682	transcript	transcript_Bed003	you know, it's  enterable	no
683	transcript	transcript_Bed003	but you  may  not enter it.	no
684	transcript	transcript_Bed003	You know? You're not allowed to.	no
685	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
686	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Unless you are, whatever, his - his divorce lawyer or something. Yeah?	no
687	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
688	transcript	transcript_Bed003	and um -	no
689	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Way-	no
690	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And these are very observable sort of from the - from the ontology sort of things.	no
691	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Does it actually help to distinguish between those two cases though?	no
692	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Whether it's	no
693	transcript	transcript_Bed003	practically speaking enterable, or	no
694	transcript	transcript_Bed003	actually physically enterable  or not?	no
695	transcript	transcript_Bed003	It seems like it would for uh, uh  determining whether they wanna go into it or not.	no
696	transcript	transcript_Bed003	y- y-	no
697	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Cuz they -	no
698	transcript	transcript_Bed003	If -	no
699	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Well I can see why -	no
700	transcript	transcript_Bed003	If you're running an errand you maybe more likely to be able to enter places that are usually not	no
701	transcript	transcript_Bed003	al- w- you're not usually - not allowed to uh- m-	no
702	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Let's get this uh b- clearer.	no
703	transcript	transcript_Bed003	S- so it's matrix between	no
704	transcript	transcript_Bed003	if it's not enterable, period.	no
705	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Whether it's a - Whether it's a public building,	no
706	transcript	transcript_Bed003	and whether it's - actually has a door.	no
707	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah, exactly.	no
708	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
709	transcript	transcript_Bed003	This is sort of uh-	no
710	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
711	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So Tom Cruise's house is   not  a public building but it has a door.	no
712	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right.	no
713	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
714	transcript	transcript_Bed003	But the thing is -	no
715	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K,	no
716	transcript	transcript_Bed003	sh- explain to me why it's necessary	no
717	transcript	transcript_Bed003	to distinguish between	no
718	transcript	transcript_Bed003	whether something	no
719	transcript	transcript_Bed003	has a door	no
720	transcript	transcript_Bed003	and is  not public.	no
721	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Or, if something -	no
722	transcript	transcript_Bed003	It seems like it's equivalent to say that it doesn't have a door a-  and it -	no
723	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
724	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"Or ""not public"" and ""not a door"" are equivalent things,  it seems like in practice."	no
725	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
726	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right.	no
727	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
728	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So we would have -	no
729	transcript	transcript_Bed003	What does it mean, then, that we have to -	no
730	transcript	transcript_Bed003	we have an object type statue. That really is an object type.	no
731	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right.	no
732	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So there is - there's gonna be a bunch of statues.	no
733	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And then we have,	no
734	transcript	transcript_Bed003	for example, an object type,	no
735	transcript	transcript_Bed003	hmm, that's a hotel. How about hotels?	no
736	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
737	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So,	no
738	transcript	transcript_Bed003	the most famous building in Heidelberg is actually a hotel.	no
739	transcript	transcript_Bed003	It's the hotel   Zum Ritter,	no
740	transcript	transcript_Bed003	which is the only Renaissance building in Heidelberg	no
741	transcript	transcript_Bed003	that was left after  the big destruction and for the Thirty Years War, blah-blah-blah.	no
742	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Hmm.	no
743	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Does it have nice walls?	no
744	transcript	transcript_Bed003	It has  wonderful  walls.	no
745	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Excellent.	no
746	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Um-	no
747	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And lots of detail, c- and carvings, engravings and so forth, so.	no
748	transcript	transcript_Bed003	But, um, it's still an unlikely candidate for the Tango  mode  I  must say.	no
749	transcript	transcript_Bed003	But.	no
750	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Um. So - s-	no
751	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So if	no
752	transcript	transcript_Bed003	you are a d-	no
753	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Well it's very tricky.	no
754	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So I guess your question is - so far I have no really arg-	no
755	transcript	transcript_Bed003	no real argument why to differentiate between statues as -	no
756	transcript	transcript_Bed003	statues and houses of celebrities,	no
757	transcript	transcript_Bed003	from that point of view.	no
758	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Huh.	no
759	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K. Let - Let's do a -	no
760	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"Can we add, just so I can see how it's done, uh, a ""has door""  property or - ?"	no
761	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
762	transcript	transcript_Bed003	What would it, uh, connect to? Like, what would, uh, it affect?	no
763	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Um, I think, um, it might affect -	no
764	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Oh actually it's - it -  it  wouldn't  affect any of our  nodes,  right?	no
765	transcript	transcript_Bed003	What I was thinking was if you had a - like -	no
766	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Oh it's - it affects th-	no
767	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"The ""doing business"" is certainly not."	no
768	transcript	transcript_Bed003	You could affect -	no
769	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"Theoretically you could affect ""doing business"" with ""has door""."	no
770	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah. O_K.	no
771	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Hmm.	no
772	transcript	transcript_Bed003	It should, um,	no
773	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right.	no
774	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Let's see.	no
775	transcript	transcript_Bed003	inhibit that, right?	no
776	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah, I don't know if JavaBayes is nice about that. It might be that if you add a new thing pointing to a variable, you just like -	no
777	transcript	transcript_Bed003	it just overwrites everything.	no
778	transcript	transcript_Bed003	But  you can check.	no
779	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Well,  we have it saved. So.	no
780	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
781	transcript	transcript_Bed003	We can rel- open it up again.	no
782	transcript	transcript_Bed003	It's true.	no
783	transcript	transcript_Bed003	The  safety net.	no
784	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I think you could just add it. I mean, I have before O_K. Whew!	no
785	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Well that's fine, but we have to see the function now. Has it become all point fives or not?	no
786	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Oh, right.	no
787	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Let's see. So this is	no
788	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"""has door"""	no
789	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Uh, true, false. That's acceptable.	no
790	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And I want to edit the function going  to  that, right?	no
791	transcript	transcript_Bed003	No. This is fine, this business.	no
792	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Oh no.	no
793	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right. It was  fine .	no
794	transcript	transcript_Bed003	2x added  this one.	no
795	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yep.	no
796	transcript	transcript_Bed003	What would be nice if it - is if it just like kept the old function for either value but.	no
797	transcript	transcript_Bed003	This -	no
798	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Nope.	no
799	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Oh.	no
800	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Didn't  do it.	no
801	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Oh wait, it might be -	no
802	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Did we w-	no
803	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yes, that's not good.	no
804	transcript	transcript_Bed003	That's  kind of annoying.	no
805	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K, so just dis- dismiss everything.	no
806	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Close it and - and load up the old state so	no
807	transcript	transcript_Bed003	it doesn't screw - screw that up.	no
808	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Let's see.	no
809	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Oops.	no
810	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Hmm.	no
811	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Maybe you can  read  in?	no
812	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Ha-	no
813	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So have you used JavaBayes a lot?	no
814	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yes. Really  I ha- I've -	no
815	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I haven't used it a lot and I haven't used it in the last you know many months so	no
816	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
817	transcript	transcript_Bed003	um, uh, we can ask someone.	no
818	transcript	transcript_Bed003	It might be worth uh - asking around. Like,	no
819	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Um.	no
820	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
821	transcript	transcript_Bed003	we looked at sort of uh - a page that had like a bunch of -	no
822	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Srini -	no
823	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K. Yeah, S- I guess he'd be the person.	no
824	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Srini's the one to ask I would say. Um. He might know.	no
825	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
826	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Cuz - Yeah.	no
827	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And.	no
828	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I mean in a way this is a lot of good features in Java it's cra- has a GUI and it's uh -	no
829	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
830	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I guess those are the main two things. It does learning, it has -	no
831	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm. Yeah.	no
832	transcript	transcript_Bed003	No it doesn't, actually.	no
833	transcript	transcript_Bed003	What?	no
834	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I didn't think it did learning.	no
835	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
836	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Maybe it did a  little  bit of learning, I don't remember.	no
837	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Oh right. Maybe you're right. O_K.	no
838	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right.	no
839	transcript	transcript_Bed003	But uh - it's free.	no
840	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Which is w- quite positive, yeah.	no
841	transcript	transcript_Bed003	But uh, yeah.	no
842	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Maybe another thing that uh -	no
843	transcript	transcript_Bed003	But I mean its interface is not the greatest. So.	no
844	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
845	transcript	transcript_Bed003	But actually it  had  an interface. A lot of  them   were like, you know.	no
846	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yep.	no
847	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Command line.	no
848	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Huh.	no
849	transcript	transcript_Bed003	What is the c- code? Can w- can we see that?	no
850	transcript	transcript_Bed003	How do you write the code or do you actually never have to write any code there?	no
851	transcript	transcript_Bed003	The c-	no
852	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah. There is actually a text file that you can edit.	no
853	transcript	transcript_Bed003	But it's - You don't have to do that.	no
854	transcript	transcript_Bed003	There's like an X_M_L format for  Bayes-nets.	no
855	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Is it X_M_L?	no
856	transcript	transcript_Bed003	The- there  is  one. I don't know if this uses it.	no
857	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Oh, I see. No this doesn't use it.	no
858	transcript	transcript_Bed003	But it -	no
859	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I didn't think it did.	no
860	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah, the - the -	no
861	transcript	transcript_Bed003	You can look at the text file.	no
862	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
863	transcript	transcript_Bed003	But do you have it here?	no
864	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Well, maybe you don't.	no
865	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Uh, yes I  do  actually. Let me see.	no
866	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Oh yes, of course. Like, there's the -	no
867	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Oh man, I didn't n-	no
868	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Is there an ampersand in DOS?	no
869	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Nope. Just s- l- start up a new D_O_S.	no
870	transcript	transcript_Bed003	We- That's alright. I can probably double cli- click on it.	no
871	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Or - Yeah, right.	no
872	transcript	transcript_Bed003	n- uh -	no
873	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Let's see.	no
874	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yep.	no
875	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Let's see, come on.	no
876	transcript	transcript_Bed003	It'll ask you what you - what it wants -	no
877	transcript	transcript_Bed003	what you want to open it with and see	no
878	transcript	transcript_Bed003	what  BAT , I guess.	no
879	transcript	transcript_Bed003	One of these days, it should open this,  theoretically.	no
880	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Go - Right mouse.	no
881	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Open with.	no
882	transcript	transcript_Bed003	That's - Oh!	no
883	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Oh  there  we go.	no
884	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Maybe it was just -	no
885	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Oh! W-	no
886	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Oh.	no
887	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Ah, it was dead.	no
888	transcript	transcript_Bed003	To the world.	no
889	transcript	transcript_Bed003	God!	no
890	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
891	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Through the old Notepad. That's my favorite editor.	no
892	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I like -	no
893	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Wordpad?	no
894	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I like Word Pad because it has the uh -	no
895	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I -	no
896	transcript	transcript_Bed003	the returns, the carriage returns on some of them.	no
897	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm. O_K.	no
898	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"You know how they get ""auto-fills"" I guess, or whatever you call it."	no
899	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mmm-hmm.	no
900	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Anyway, there it is.	no
901	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So this is sort of LISP-y?	no
902	transcript	transcript_Bed003	No.	no
903	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Uh, Yeah.	no
904	transcript	transcript_Bed003	It just basically looks like it just specifies a bunch of STRUCTs.	no
905	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
906	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
907	transcript	transcript_Bed003	That's how actual probability tables are specified. As, like, lists of numbers.	no
908	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
909	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
910	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
911	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So theoretically you could edit that.	no
912	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
913	transcript	transcript_Bed003	But  they're not very friendly.	no
914	transcript	transcript_Bed003	It just that - it's -	no
915	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah the ordering isn't very clear on -	no
916	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right.	no
917	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So you'd have to like figure out -	no
918	transcript	transcript_Bed003	The layout  of the table. Yeah.	no
919	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Like you have to go and - Yeah.	no
920	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Well I -	no
921	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Actually we could  write  a program that could  generate  this.	no
922	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
923	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I think so.	no
924	transcript	transcript_Bed003	You could.	no
925	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah you could.	no
926	transcript	transcript_Bed003	it's not -	no
927	transcript	transcript_Bed003	We were doing it -	no
928	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah we can maybe write an interface th- for uh entering probability distributions easily,	no
929	transcript	transcript_Bed003	something  like - like a little script.	no
930	transcript	transcript_Bed003	That might  be worth it.	no
931	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And that might do.	no
932	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah. I actually seem to recall Srini complaining about something to do with Entering probability so this is probably	no
933	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah, it's - Yeah.	no
934	transcript	transcript_Bed003	The other thing is it is in Java  so.	no
935	transcript	transcript_Bed003	We could  manipulate the source  itself?  Or -	no
936	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
937	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Do you have the true source files or just the class?	no
938	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I don't know if he actually -	no
939	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah. Uh, yeah. we do	no
940	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Does he -	no
941	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"I - I saw directory called ""source"", or -"	no
942	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Oh.	no
943	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
944	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I didn't e-	no
945	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.  Go up one?	no
946	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Up one.	no
947	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
948	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"Ah yes, good. ""Source""."	no
949	transcript	transcript_Bed003	That's - that's quite nice.	no
950	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I don't know if it actually manipulate the source, though. That might be a bit complicated. I think it might - it might be simpler to just  have a script that, you know -	no
951	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
952	transcript	transcript_Bed003	It's, like, friendly, it allows you enter things well.	no
953	transcript	transcript_Bed003	The d-	no
954	transcript	transcript_Bed003	the data tables.	no
955	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
956	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right.	no
957	transcript	transcript_Bed003	But if th- if there is an X_M_L	no
958	transcript	transcript_Bed003	file that - or format that it can also read -	no
959	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I mean it just reads this, right? When it starts.	no
960	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
961	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah I know there is an - I was looking on the we- web page and he's updated it for an X_M_L version of I guess Bayes-nets. There's a Bayes-net spec for - in X_M_L.	no
962	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
963	transcript	transcript_Bed003	He's - Like this guy has? The JavaBayes guy? So - but, e- he doesn't use it. So in what sense has he updated it?	no
964	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
965	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Well th- you can either - you ca- or you can read both.	no
966	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Oh. I see.	no
967	transcript	transcript_Bed003	To my understanding.	no
968	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K. That would be awesome.	no
969	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Oh.	no
970	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Because uh -	no
971	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Well at least the - uh -	no
972	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I could have misread the web page, I have a habit of doing that, but.	no
973	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
974	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K, wonderful.	no
975	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So you got more slides?	no
976	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Do I have more slides?	no
977	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"Um yes, one more. ""Future Work"". I think every presentation have a should have a ""Future Work"" slide."	no
978	transcript	transcript_Bed003	But uh it's basically - we already talked about all this stuff, so.	no
979	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Um. The additional thing is I guess learning the probabilities,  also.	no
980	transcript	transcript_Bed003	E- That's maybe, I don't know -	no
981	transcript	transcript_Bed003	If - Does -	no
982	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Uh that's future  future  work.	no
983	transcript	transcript_Bed003	That's - Yeah.	no
984	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right.	no
985	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Very  future.	no
986	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
987	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"And of course if you have a presentation that doesn't - have something that doesn't work at all, then you have ""What I learned"","	no
988	transcript	transcript_Bed003	as a slide.	no
989	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Can't you have both?	no
990	transcript	transcript_Bed003	You  could.	no
991	transcript	transcript_Bed003	My first approach failed.	no
992	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right.	no
993	transcript	transcript_Bed003	What I learned. O_K, so I think that uh- our presentation's finished.	no
994	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Good.	no
995	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I know what I like about these meetings is one person will nod, and then the next person will nod, and then it just goes all the way around the room.	no
996	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So the uh -	no
997	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I missed my turn.	no
998	transcript	transcript_Bed003	No I - Earlier I went  and Bhaskara went  and you did it.  You did it.	no
999	transcript	transcript_Bed003	It's like yawning.	no
1000	transcript	transcript_Bed003	It's like yawning.	no
1001	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And this announcement was in stereo.	no
1002	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Ha.	no
1003	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
1004	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So this means um -	no
1005	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Should I pull up the  net again?  Yes.	no
1006	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah. Could you put the - the um, net up again? Thanks.	no
1007	transcript	transcript_Bed003	There  we go.	no
1008	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And actually I was - cuz I got a wireless mike on.	no
1009	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"So a more general thing than ""discussed admission fee"" um, could be - I - I'm just wondering whether the context, the background context of the discourse"	no
1010	transcript	transcript_Bed003	might be -	no
1011	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I don't know, if there's a way to  define  it or maybe you know generalize it some way	no
1012	transcript	transcript_Bed003	um, there might be other cues that, say, um,	no
1013	transcript	transcript_Bed003	in the last few utterances	no
1014	transcript	transcript_Bed003	there has been something that has strongly associated with say one of the particular modes	no
1015	transcript	transcript_Bed003	uh, I don't know if that might be -	no
1016	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
1017	transcript	transcript_Bed003	uh, and - and into that node would be various - various things that - that could  have  specifically come up.	no
1018	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I think we -	no
1019	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I think a - a sort of general strategy here -	no
1020	transcript	transcript_Bed003	You know, this is - this is excellent because -	no
1021	transcript	transcript_Bed003	um it gets you thinking along these terms - is that maybe	no
1022	transcript	transcript_Bed003	we ob- we could observe a couple of	no
1023	transcript	transcript_Bed003	um	no
1024	transcript	transcript_Bed003	discourse phenomena	no
1025	transcript	transcript_Bed003	such as	no
1026	transcript	transcript_Bed003	the admission fee,  and	no
1027	transcript	transcript_Bed003	something else and something else, that happened in the discourse before.	no
1028	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
1029	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right.	no
1030	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And um -	no
1031	transcript	transcript_Bed003	let's make those four.	no
1032	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And maybe there are two um -	no
1033	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So maybe this could be sort of a separate	no
1034	transcript	transcript_Bed003	region of the net,	no
1035	transcript	transcript_Bed003	which has two -	no
1036	transcript	transcript_Bed003	has it's own middle layer.	no
1037	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Maybe this, you know, has some  kind  of um,	no
1038	transcript	transcript_Bed003	funky thing that di- if this and this may influence	no
1039	transcript	transcript_Bed003	these hidden nodes of the discourse which is maybe something	no
1040	transcript	transcript_Bed003	that is uh,	no
1041	transcript	transcript_Bed003	a more general version of the actual	no
1042	transcript	transcript_Bed003	phenomenon that you can observe. So things that point	no
1043	transcript	transcript_Bed003	towards -	no
1044	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So instead of single node, for	no
1045	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"like, if they  said  the word ""admission fee"" -"	no
1046	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Exactly. Yeah.	no
1047	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"""admission fee"", or maybe, you know, ""how much to enter"" or you know something,  other  cues. Exactly."	no
1048	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Opening hours or something like that.	no
1049	transcript	transcript_Bed003	That would all f- funnel into one node that would  constitute entrance requirements or something like that.	no
1050	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"So "" pay a  visit"" -"	no
1051	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
1052	transcript	transcript_Bed003	uh- uh- d-	no
1053	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Sure. Yeah.	no
1054	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah?	no
1055	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I mean it sort of get into plan recognition kinds of things in the discourse. I mean that's like the bigger um,	no
1056	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Exactly. Yeah? And then maybe there are some	no
1057	transcript	transcript_Bed003	version of it.	no
1058	transcript	transcript_Bed003	discourse acts if they happened before,	no
1059	transcript	transcript_Bed003	um it's more for um	no
1060	transcript	transcript_Bed003	a cue that the person actually wants to get somewhere else and that you are in a - in a - in a route	no
1061	transcript	transcript_Bed003	um, sort of proceeding	no
1062	transcript	transcript_Bed003	past  these things, so this would be just something that - where you	no
1063	transcript	transcript_Bed003	want to	no
1064	transcript	transcript_Bed003	pass it. Hmm?	no
1065	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Is that it?	no
1066	transcript	transcript_Bed003	However these are of course  then	no
1067	transcript	transcript_Bed003	the -	no
1068	transcript	transcript_Bed003	the nodes, the  observed  nodes, for  your  middle layer.	no
1069	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"So this  again points to ""final destination"", ""doing business"", ""tourist hurry"" and so forth."	no
1070	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
1071	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
1072	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah?	no
1073	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"And so then we can say, ""O_K. we have a whole  region -"""	no
1074	transcript	transcript_Bed003	That's a whole set of discourse related cues to your middle layer.  Right?	no
1075	transcript	transcript_Bed003	in a e-	no
1076	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah, exactly. And this is just - then just one.	no
1077	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So e- because at the end the more we um - add,	no
1078	transcript	transcript_Bed003	you know, the more spider-web-ish it's going to become in the middle and the more of hand editing. It's going to get very ugly.	no
1079	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"But with  this  way we could say ""O_K, these are the  discourse phenomena. They ra- may have there own hidden layer"	no
1080	transcript	transcript_Bed003	that points to some of  the - the  real  hidden layer,	no
1081	transcript	transcript_Bed003	um or the general hidden layer.	no
1082	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Sure.	no
1083	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And the same we will be able to do for	no
1084	transcript	transcript_Bed003	syntactic information, the verbs used, the object types used, modifiers.	no
1085	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And maybe there's a hidden layer	no
1086	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yep.	no
1087	transcript	transcript_Bed003	for that. And so forth and so forth. Then we have context.	no
1088	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah. So essentially a lot of those nodes can be expanded into little Bayes-nets of their own.	no
1089	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yep.	no
1090	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
1091	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Precisely.	no
1092	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So.	no
1093	transcript	transcript_Bed003	One thing that's kind of been bugging me	yes
1094	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So.	no
1095	transcript	transcript_Bed003	One thing that's kind of been bugging me	no
1096	transcript	transcript_Bed003	when I - more I look at this is that the -	no
1097	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I guess, the fact that the -	no
1098	transcript	transcript_Bed003	there's a complete separation between the  observed features and in the output.	no
1099	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
1100	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I mean, it makes it cleaner, but then uh - I mean.	no
1101	transcript	transcript_Bed003	That's true.	no
1102	transcript	transcript_Bed003	For instance if	no
1103	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"the discourse does - well for instance, the ""discourse admission fee""  node"	no
1104	transcript	transcript_Bed003	What do you mean by that?	no
1105	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Uh-huh.	no
1106	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"seems like it should point directly to the - or increase the probability of ""enter  directly"" versus ""going there via tourist""."	no
1107	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah. Or we could like add more, uh,	no
1108	transcript	transcript_Bed003	sort of middle nodes. Like we could add a node like	no
1109	transcript	transcript_Bed003	do they want to enter it, which is affected by admission fee  and  by whether it's closed  and  by whether it has a door.	no
1110	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
1111	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So it's like -	no
1112	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right.	no
1113	transcript	transcript_Bed003	There are - Those are the two options. Either like make an arrow directly or put a new node.	no
1114	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Hmm.	no
1115	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah, that makes sense.	no
1116	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
1117	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And if it - if you do it -	no
1118	transcript	transcript_Bed003	If you could connect it too hard you may get such phenomenon that - like	no
1119	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"""So how much has it cost to enter?"" and the answer is two hundred fifty dollars,"	no
1120	transcript	transcript_Bed003	and then the persons says	no
1121	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"um ""Yeah I want to see it."""	no
1122	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah?	no
1123	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"meaning ""It's way out of my budget"" um -"	no
1124	transcript	transcript_Bed003	There are places in Germany where it costs two hundred fifty dollars to enter?	no
1125	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Um, nothing comes to mind.	no
1126	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Without thinking too hard. Um, maybe, yeah of course, um opera premiers.	no
1127	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Really?	no
1128	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So you know.	no
1129	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Hmm.	no
1130	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Or - or any good old Pink Floyd concert.	no
1131	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I see.	no
1132	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"If you want to see ""The Magic Flute"" or something."	no
1133	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
1134	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Or maybe um, a famous restaurant. or, I don't know. There are various things that you might w- not want to eat a  meal there but   your own table .	no
1135	transcript	transcript_Bed003	The Spagos of Heidelberg.	no
1136	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I think that the h- I mean nothing beats the - the admission charge prices in Japan.	no
1137	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So there, two hundred dollars is - is moderate for getting into a discotheque.	no
1138	transcript	transcript_Bed003	You know.	no
1139	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Really.	no
1140	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Then again,	no
1141	transcript	transcript_Bed003	everything else is free then once you're ins-  in  there.	no
1142	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Food and drink and so forth. So.	no
1143	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I mean.	no
1144	transcript	transcript_Bed003	But i- you know, i- we  can  - Something -	no
1145	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Somebody  can  have discussed the admission fee and u- the answer	no
1146	transcript	transcript_Bed003	is s-	no
1147	transcript	transcript_Bed003	if we -  um, you know, um -	no
1148	transcript	transcript_Bed003	still,	no
1149	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Hmm.	no
1150	transcript	transcript_Bed003	based on that result is  never  going to enter that building. You know? Because it's just too expensive.	no
1151	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Oh yeah, I think I see.	no
1152	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"So the discourse refers to ""admission fee"" but it just turns out that"	no
1153	transcript	transcript_Bed003	they change their mind in the middle of the discourse.	no
1154	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah. you have to have some notion of not just -	no
1155	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I mean there's a -	no
1156	transcript	transcript_Bed003	there's change across several turns of discourse so	no
1157	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right.	no
1158	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
1159	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I don't know how - if any of this was discussed - but how i- if it all this is going to interact with	no
1160	transcript	transcript_Bed003	whatever general  uh, other - other discourse processing that might be happen.  I mean.	no
1161	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
1162	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
1163	transcript	transcript_Bed003	What sort of discourse  processing is uh - are the -	no
1164	transcript	transcript_Bed003	How much is built into SmartKom and -	no
1165	transcript	transcript_Bed003	It works like this. The uh,	no
1166	transcript	transcript_Bed003	um -	no
1167	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I mean.	no
1168	transcript	transcript_Bed003	The first thing we get is that	no
1169	transcript	transcript_Bed003	already the  intention  is sort of t-	no
1170	transcript	transcript_Bed003	They  tried  to figure out the intention, right?	no
1171	transcript	transcript_Bed003	simply by parsing it.	no
1172	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And this um - m-	no
1173	transcript	transcript_Bed003	won't differentiate between  all  modes, yeah?	no
1174	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"but at least it'll tell us ""O_K here we have something that -"	no
1175	transcript	transcript_Bed003	somebody that wants to go  someplace,  now it's up for us to figure out	no
1176	transcript	transcript_Bed003	what kind of going there is - is -  is happening,	no
1177	transcript	transcript_Bed003	and um, if the discourse takes a couple of turns before everything - all the information is needed,	no
1178	transcript	transcript_Bed003	what happens is you know the parser parses it and then it's handed on to the discourse history which is,	no
1179	transcript	transcript_Bed003	um o- one of the most elaborate -	no
1180	transcript	transcript_Bed003	elaborate modules. It's - it's actually the - the whole memory of the entire system,	no
1181	transcript	transcript_Bed003	that knows what - wh- who said what, which was - what was presented. It helps an- an- anaphora resolution and it -	no
1182	transcript	transcript_Bed003	and it fills in all the structures that are omitted,	no
1183	transcript	transcript_Bed003	so,  um,	no
1184	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"because you say ""O_K,  how can I get to the castle?"	no
1185	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"""Oh, how - how much is it?"""	no
1186	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"and um ""yeah I would like uh - um -"	no
1187	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"to g- let's do it"" and so forth."	no
1188	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So even without an a- ana-	no
1189	transcript	transcript_Bed003	anaphora somebody has to make sure that	no
1190	transcript	transcript_Bed003	information we had  earlier  on is still here.	no
1191	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
1192	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Because not every module keeps a memory of everything that happened.	no
1193	transcript	transcript_Bed003	so  whenever the uh,	no
1194	transcript	transcript_Bed003	um person is not actually  rejecting  what happened before,	no
1195	transcript	transcript_Bed003	so as in	no
1196	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"""No I really  don't  want to see that movie."	no
1197	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"I'd rather stay home and watch T_V"""	no
1198	transcript	transcript_Bed003	um -	no
1199	transcript	transcript_Bed003	What movie was selected in what cinema in what town is - is going to be sort of	no
1200	transcript	transcript_Bed003	added into the disc- into the representations	no
1201	transcript	transcript_Bed003	every di- at each dialogue step, by the discourse model -	no
1202	transcript	transcript_Bed003	discourse  model, Yeah, that's what it's called.	no
1203	transcript	transcript_Bed003	and, um, it does some help in the anaphora resolution and it also helps in coordinating	no
1204	transcript	transcript_Bed003	the gesture screen issues. So a person pointing to something on the screen, you know,	no
1205	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Hmm.	no
1206	transcript	transcript_Bed003	the discourse model actually stores what was presented at what location on the s- on the screen so it's a - it's a rather huge  -	no
1207	transcript	transcript_Bed003	huge thing but um -	no
1208	transcript	transcript_Bed003	um -	no
1209	transcript	transcript_Bed003	we can	no
1210	transcript	transcript_Bed003	sort of - It has a very clear interface. We can query it	no
1211	transcript	transcript_Bed003	whether admission fees were discussed in the last turn and - and the turn before that or you know	no
1212	transcript	transcript_Bed003	how  deep we want to search	no
1213	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
1214	transcript	transcript_Bed003	um - which is a question. How deep  do  we want to sear, you know?	no
1215	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Um - but	no
1216	transcript	transcript_Bed003	we should	no
1217	transcript	transcript_Bed003	try to keep in mind that,	no
1218	transcript	transcript_Bed003	you know, we're doing this sort of for research, so we - we should find a limit	no
1219	transcript	transcript_Bed003	that's reasonable and not go,	no
1220	transcript	transcript_Bed003	you know,	no
1221	transcript	transcript_Bed003	all the way back to Adam and Eve.	no
1222	transcript	transcript_Bed003	You know, did that person ever discuss admissions fee -	no
1223	transcript	transcript_Bed003	fees in his entire life?	no
1224	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And the dialogues are pretty - pretty you know	no
1225	transcript	transcript_Bed003	concise and - Anyway.	no
1226	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So one thing that might be helpful which is implicit in the	no
1227	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"use of ""admission fee discussion"" as a cue for entry,"	no
1228	transcript	transcript_Bed003	is thinking about the plans that various people might have.	no
1229	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Like all the different  sort of general schemas that they might be following	no
1230	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K. This person is um,	no
1231	transcript	transcript_Bed003	finding out information about this thing in order to go	no
1232	transcript	transcript_Bed003	in as a tourist or finding out how to get to this place	no
1233	transcript	transcript_Bed003	in order to do business.	no
1234	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Um, because then	no
1235	transcript	transcript_Bed003	anything that's a cue for one of the steps	no
1236	transcript	transcript_Bed003	would be slight evidence for that overall plan.	no
1237	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Um, I don't know. They're - in - in non- in sort of more traditional A_I kinds of plan recognition things you sort of have	no
1238	transcript	transcript_Bed003	you know, some idea at each turn of agent doing something,	no
1239	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"""O_K, wha- what plans is this a - consistent with?"""	no
1240	transcript	transcript_Bed003	and then get s- some more information and then you see	no
1241	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"""here's a sequence that this sort of roughly fits into""."	no
1242	transcript	transcript_Bed003	It - it might be useful here too. I - I don't know how you know you'd have to	no
1243	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
1244	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I mean the -	no
1245	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Hmm.	no
1246	transcript	transcript_Bed003	figure out what knowl- what knowledge representation would work for that.	no
1247	transcript	transcript_Bed003	u- u-	no
1248	transcript	transcript_Bed003	It's in the - these - these - these plan schemas.	no
1249	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I mean there are some - some of them are  extremely  elaborate, you know.	no
1250	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"""What do you need - need to buy a ticket?"" You know?"	no
1251	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.	no
1252	transcript	transcript_Bed003	and it - it's fifty steps,  huh?	no
1253	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
1254	transcript	transcript_Bed003	just for buying a ticket  at a ticket counter,	no
1255	transcript	transcript_Bed003	you know, and - and maybe that's helpful to look at it - to look at those.	no
1256	transcript	transcript_Bed003	It's amazing what human beings can do. W- when we talked uh we had the example, you know, of you being uh - a s- a person on a ticket counter working at railway station and somebody r-	no
1257	transcript	transcript_Bed003	runs up to you with a suitcase in his hands, says	no
1258	transcript	transcript_Bed003	New York	no
1259	transcript	transcript_Bed003	and you say	no
1260	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Track seven, huh?	no
1261	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And it's because you know that that person actually is following,	no
1262	transcript	transcript_Bed003	you know -	no
1263	transcript	transcript_Bed003	You execute a whole plan of going through a hundred and fifty steps,	no
1264	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"you know, without any information other than ""New York"", huh?"	no
1265	transcript	transcript_Bed003	inferring everything from the context. So,	no
1266	transcript	transcript_Bed003	works.	no
1267	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Um, even though there is probably no train from here to New York,  right?	no
1268	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mmm. Not direct.	no
1269	transcript	transcript_Bed003	You'd uh probably have to transfer in Chicago.	no
1270	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
1271	transcript	transcript_Bed003	But uh - it's possible.	no
1272	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Um, no you probably have to transfer also somewhere else.	no
1273	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right?	no
1274	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Is that t- San Francisco, Chicago?	no
1275	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I think -	no
1276	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Is that possible?	no
1277	transcript	transcript_Bed003	One time I saw a report on trains,	no
1278	transcript	transcript_Bed003	and I think there is a l-	no
1279	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I don't know if - I thought there was a line that went from	no
1280	transcript	transcript_Bed003	somewhere, maybe it was Sacramento to Chicago, but there was like a California to Chicago line of some sort.	no
1281	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
1282	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Hmm.	no
1283	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I could be wrong though. It was a while ago.	no
1284	transcript	transcript_Bed003	The Transcontinental Railroad, doesn't that ring a bell?	no
1285	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I think it has to exist somewhere.	no
1286	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah but I don't know if it's still -	no
1287	transcript	transcript_Bed003	They might have blown it up.	no
1288	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Well it never went all the way, right? I mean you always had to change trains at Omaha, right?	no
1289	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Well   most   of the way. Uh.	no
1290	transcript	transcript_Bed003	One track ended there and the other one started at - five meters away from that	no
1291	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm. Yeah.	no
1292	transcript	transcript_Bed003	and	no
1293	transcript	transcript_Bed003	sort of -	no
1294	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Well.  You seem to know better than we do so.	no
1295	transcript	transcript_Bed003	yeah?	no
1296	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Has anybody ever  been  on an Amtrak?	no
1297	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I have. But not transcontinentally.	no
1298	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
1299	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I'm frightened by Amtrak myself.	no
1300	transcript	transcript_Bed003	What? Why?	no
1301	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I just -	no
1302	transcript	transcript_Bed003	They seem to have a lot of accidents on the Amtrak.	no
1303	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Really?	no
1304	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Their reputation is very bad. huh?	no
1305	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
1306	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
1307	transcript	transcript_Bed003	It's not maybe reality.	no
1308	transcript	transcript_Bed003	It's not like German trains.	no
1309	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Like German trains are really great so.	no
1310	transcript	transcript_Bed003	But -	no
1311	transcript	transcript_Bed003	you know, I don't know whether it's -	no
1312	transcript	transcript_Bed003	which ones are safer,	no
1313	transcript	transcript_Bed003	you know, statistically.	no
1314	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Um, but they're faster.	no
1315	transcript	transcript_Bed003	@@	no
1316	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
1317	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Much  faster. Mm-hmm.	no
1318	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And there's much more of them. Yeah, they're	no
1319	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah, it's  way better	no
1320	transcript	transcript_Bed003	yeah	no
1321	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I used - um Amtrak quite a bit on the east coast	no
1322	transcript	transcript_Bed003	and I was surprised.	no
1323	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
1324	transcript	transcript_Bed003	It was actually O_K.	no
1325	transcript	transcript_Bed003	You know, on Boston New York, New York Rhode Island, whatever,  Boston.	no
1326	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
1327	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
1328	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I've done that kind of thing.	no
1329	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
1330	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
1331	transcript	transcript_Bed003	But -	no
1332	transcript	transcript_Bed003	That's  a different issue.	no
1333	transcript	transcript_Bed003	This  is going  to be an interesting transcript.	no
1334	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"I - I want to see what it does with uh ""landmark-iness""."	no
1335	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Hmm?	no
1336	transcript	transcript_Bed003	That's -	no
1337	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
1338	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Let's all say it a few more times.  Just kidding.	no
1339	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So.	no
1340	transcript	transcript_Bed003	It'd help it figure it out.	no
1341	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right.	no
1342	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
1343	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So by the way tha- that structure	no
1344	transcript	transcript_Bed003	that Robert drew on the board was like more um,	no
1345	transcript	transcript_Bed003	cue-type-based, right, here's like we're gonna  segment off a bit of stuff that comes from discourse	no
1346	transcript	transcript_Bed003	and then	no
1347	transcript	transcript_Bed003	some of the things we're talking about here are more -	no
1348	transcript	transcript_Bed003	you know, we mentioned maybe	no
1349	transcript	transcript_Bed003	if they talk about	no
1350	transcript	transcript_Bed003	um, I don't know, entering or som- you know like they might be more task-based.	no
1351	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Hmm.	no
1352	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So I - I don't know if there - There's obviously some -	no
1353	transcript	transcript_Bed003	m- more than one way of organizing  the variables into something so.	no
1354	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I think that um -	no
1355	transcript	transcript_Bed003	What you guys did is really nicely sketching out different tasks,	no
1356	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
1357	transcript	transcript_Bed003	and maybe some of their conditions.	no
1358	transcript	transcript_Bed003	One task is more likely you're in a hurry when you do that kind of s-	no
1359	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
1360	transcript	transcript_Bed003	doing business, and - and less in a hurry when uh - you're a tourist	no
1361	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Um -  tourists may have - never have final destinations, you know because they are eternally traveling around so	no
1362	transcript	transcript_Bed003	maybe what - what - what happened -	no
1363	transcript	transcript_Bed003	what  might  happen is that we  do  get this sort of task-based	no
1364	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
1365	transcript	transcript_Bed003	middle  layer,	no
1366	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
1367	transcript	transcript_Bed003	and then we'll get these  sub-middle  layers, that are more cue-based.	no
1368	transcript	transcript_Bed003	That feed into those?	no
1369	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
1370	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Nah?	no
1371	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Might be - might be a nice dichotomy of - of the world.	no
1372	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So,	no
1373	transcript	transcript_Bed003	um	no
1374	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I suggest w- to - for -	no
1375	transcript	transcript_Bed003	to proceed with this in - in the sense that	no
1376	transcript	transcript_Bed003	maybe throughout this week	no
1377	transcript	transcript_Bed003	the three of us will - will talk some more about maybe segmenting off different regions,	no
1378	transcript	transcript_Bed003	and we make up some -  some toy	no
1379	transcript	transcript_Bed003	a-	no
1380	transcript	transcript_Bed003	observable	no
1381	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"""nodes"" - is that what th-"	no
1382	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Refined y- re- just refine the -	no
1383	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
1384	transcript	transcript_Bed003	What's the technical term?	no
1385	transcript	transcript_Bed003	For which?	no
1386	transcript	transcript_Bed003	For the uh - nodes that are observable?	no
1387	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"The ""outer layer""?"	no
1388	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Just observable nodes, evidence nodes?	no
1389	transcript	transcript_Bed003	The features, I don't know, whatever you -	no
1390	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Feature ma- make up some features for those -	no
1391	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
1392	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Identify  four regions, maybe make up some features for each region and uh -	no
1393	transcript	transcript_Bed003	and uh, uh - and uh -	no
1394	transcript	transcript_Bed003	middle layer for those.	no
1395	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And then these should then connect somehow to the more plan-based deep space	no
1396	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
1397	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Basically just refine  some of the	no
1398	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yep.	no
1399	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah, this is totally like - The probabilities and all are completely ad-hoc. We need to look at all of them.	no
1400	transcript	transcript_Bed003	more general nodes.	no
1401	transcript	transcript_Bed003	The- they - they  will  be aud- ad-hoc for - for - for  some  time to come.	no
1402	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I mean but, they're even like	no
1403	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I mean like, close to the end we were like, uh,	no
1404	transcript	transcript_Bed003	you know we were like uh   really  ad-hoc.	no
1405	transcript	transcript_Bed003	It's a even distribution.  Like, whatever.	no
1406	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right? Cuz if it's like, uh - If it's four things coming in, right?	no
1407	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And, say, some of them have like three possibilities and all that. So you're thinking like -	no
1408	transcript	transcript_Bed003	like a hundred and forty four or something	no
1409	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And -  That's terrible.	no
1410	transcript	transcript_Bed003	possible things - numbers to enter, right? So.	no
1411	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Some of them are completely absurd too, like -	no
1412	transcript	transcript_Bed003	That's uh -	no
1413	transcript	transcript_Bed003	they want to enter, but it's closed, it's night time, you know there are tourists and all this weird stuff happens at the line up and you're like -	no
1414	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Well -	no
1415	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah, the only like possible interpretation is that they are like -	no
1416	transcript	transcript_Bed003	confused.	no
1417	transcript	transcript_Bed003	come here just to rob the museum or	no
1418	transcript	transcript_Bed003	something to that effect.	no
1419	transcript	transcript_Bed003	In which case you're supposed to alert the authorities,  and see appropriate action.	no
1420	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
1421	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
1422	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah, another thing to do, um, is also to, um - I guess to ask around people about other Bayes-net packages.	yes
1423	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah, another thing to do, um, is also to, um - I guess to ask around people about other Bayes-net packages.	no
1424	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Is Srini gonna be  at the meeting tomorrow, do you know?	no
1425	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Maybe.	no
1426	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Wait -	no
1427	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Quite possibly. Oh, oh, sorry. Sorry, Wednesday, yeah.	no
1428	transcript	transcript_Bed003	The day  after  tomorrow.  Wednesday.	no
1429	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Day after tomorrow. Yeah.	no
1430	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Maybe we can ask him about it.	no
1431	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Who's talking on Wednesday?	no
1432	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mmm.	no
1433	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I haven't -	no
1434	transcript	transcript_Bed003	J- Jerry never sent out a - sent out an email,  did he, ever ?	no
1435	transcript	transcript_Bed003	No. But he mentioned at the last meeting that someone was going to be talking, I forget who. Uh.	no
1436	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Oh, isn't Ben?	no
1437	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Ben? I think it's Ben actually, yeah,	no
1438	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Ben,  then , Ben.	no
1439	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Ah!	no
1440	transcript	transcript_Bed003	um,	no
1441	transcript	transcript_Bed003	giving his job talk I think.	no
1442	transcript	transcript_Bed003	um,	no
1443	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Sorry.  I was just reading the screen.	no
1444	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
1445	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Oh.	no
1446	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
1447	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So the uh -	no
1448	transcript	transcript_Bed003	That will be one - one thing we could do.	no
1449	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I actually uh, have - Um, also we can uh, start looking at the SmartKom tables and I will -	no
1450	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Right.	no
1451	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I actually wanted to show that  to you guys now but um.	no
1452	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Do you want to  trade?	no
1453	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Um, no I -	no
1454	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I actually made a mistake because it - it fell asleep and when Linux falls asleep on my machine it's - it doesn't wake up ever, so I had to reboot	no
1455	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Oh, no.	no
1456	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And if I reboot without a network, I will not be able to start SmartKom,	no
1457	transcript	transcript_Bed003	because I need to have a network.	no
1458	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Uh -	no
1459	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So we'll do that t- maybe uh -	no
1460	transcript	transcript_Bed003	But. O_K. But once you start - sart- start SmartKom you can be on - You don't have to be on a network anymore. Is that the deal?	no
1461	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yep.	no
1462	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Ah, interesting.	no
1463	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Why does SmartKom need a network?	no
1464	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Um -  it looks up some stuff that,	no
1465	transcript	transcript_Bed003	you know, is - is that - is in the - written by the operating system only if it - if you get a D_H_C_P request, so it -	no
1466	transcript	transcript_Bed003	you know, my computer does not know its I_P address,	no
1467	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Ah.	no
1468	transcript	transcript_Bed003	you know?	no
1469	transcript	transcript_Bed003	You know. So.	no
1470	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Unless it boots up with networking.	no
1471	transcript	transcript_Bed003	It's plugged in. Yeah.	no
1472	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And I don't have an I_P address, they can't look up -	no
1473	transcript	transcript_Bed003	they don't know who localhost is, and so forth and so forth.	no
1474	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Hmm.	no
1475	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Always fun.	no
1476	transcript	transcript_Bed003	But it's a, um,	yes
1477	transcript	transcript_Bed003	But it's a, um,	no
1478	transcript	transcript_Bed003	simple solution. We can just um,	no
1479	transcript	transcript_Bed003	go downstairs and - and - and look at this, but maybe not today.	no
1480	transcript	transcript_Bed003	The other thing um -	no
1481	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I will -	no
1482	transcript	transcript_Bed003	oh yeah,	no
1483	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K, I have to report	no
1484	transcript	transcript_Bed003	um, data collection.	no
1485	transcript	transcript_Bed003	We interviewed Fey,	no
1486	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
1487	transcript	transcript_Bed003	She's willing to do it,	no
1488	transcript	transcript_Bed003	meaning be the wizard	no
1489	transcript	transcript_Bed003	for the data collection, also	no
1490	transcript	transcript_Bed003	maybe transcribe a little bit, if she has to,	no
1491	transcript	transcript_Bed003	but also recruiting subjects, organizing them, and so forth.	no
1492	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So that looks good.	no
1493	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Jerry however suggested that we should uh have a trial run with her,	no
1494	transcript	transcript_Bed003	see whether she can actually do all the uh spontaneous, eloquent and creativeness that we uh expect of the wizard.	no
1495	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And I talked to Liz about this and it looks as if Friday afternoon	no
1496	transcript	transcript_Bed003	will be the time when we have a first trial run	no
1497	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So who would be the subject  of this trial run?	no
1498	transcript	transcript_Bed003	for the data.	no
1499	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Pardon me?	no
1500	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Who - Will there be a -	no
1501	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Is one - Is you - one of you gonna be the subject? Like are you -	no
1502	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Um Liz also volunteered to be the first subject,	no
1503	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Good.	no
1504	transcript	transcript_Bed003	which I think might be even better than us guys.	no
1505	transcript	transcript_Bed003	One of us, yeah.	no
1506	transcript	transcript_Bed003	If we do need her for the technical stuff, then of course one of you has to sort of uh - jump in.	no
1507	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I like how we've -	no
1508	transcript	transcript_Bed003	you guys have successfully narrowed it down.	no
1509	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"""Is one of  you  going to be the subject?"" Is one of you - jump in."	no
1510	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Reference.   I  haven't done it yet.	no
1511	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Well I just figured it has to be someone who's, um,	no
1512	transcript	transcript_Bed003	familiar enough with the data to cause problems for the wizard,	no
1513	transcript	transcript_Bed003	so we can, uh, see if they're you know	no
1514	transcript	transcript_Bed003	good.	no
1515	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Oh plants? e- u- someone who can plant difficult	no
1516	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
1517	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I mean that's what we wanna  check, right?	no
1518	transcript	transcript_Bed003	things.	no
1519	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Um,	no
1520	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Well, in this case it's a p- it's a  sort of testing of the wizard rather than of the subject. It's uh -	no
1521	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Isn't that what it is?	no
1522	transcript	transcript_Bed003	yes w- we - we would like to test the wizard,	no
1523	transcript	transcript_Bed003	but  you know, if we take a subject that is completely	no
1524	transcript	transcript_Bed003	unfamiliar with the task, or any of the set up, we get a more realistic	no
1525	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I guess that would be reasonable.	no
1526	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
1527	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
1528	transcript	transcript_Bed003	you know, set up as -	no
1529	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I know. That's probably a good enough test of -	no
1530	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Uh-huh.	no
1531	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Sort of having an actively antagonistic, uh -	no
1532	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
1533	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
1534	transcript	transcript_Bed003	That might be a little unfair.	no
1535	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Um.	no
1536	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah.	no
1537	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I'm sure if we uh, - You think there's a chance we might need Liz for,	no
1538	transcript	transcript_Bed003	whatever, the technical side of things?	no
1539	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I'm sure we can get	no
1540	transcript	transcript_Bed003	other people around who don't know anything	no
1541	transcript	transcript_Bed003	um,	no
1542	transcript	transcript_Bed003	if we want another subject. You know. Like I can drag Ben into it or something.	no
1543	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yeah, yeah.	no
1544	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Although he might cause problems   but.	no
1545	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So, is it a experimental setup for the	no
1546	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"I like that. ""Test the wizard."""	no
1547	transcript	transcript_Bed003	um, data collection  totally  ready -	no
1548	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I want that on a T_shirt.	no
1549	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Um - I think it's - it's - it's - I mean -	no
1550	transcript	transcript_Bed003	determined?	no
1551	transcript	transcript_Bed003	experimental setup u- on the technical issue yes, except we st-	no
1552	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I think we still need uh - a recording device for the wizard,	no
1553	transcript	transcript_Bed003	just a tape recorder that's running in a room.	no
1554	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
1555	transcript	transcript_Bed003	But um - in terms of specifying the scenario,	no
1556	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
1557	transcript	transcript_Bed003	um - uh - uh - we've gotten a little further but um -	no
1558	transcript	transcript_Bed003	we wanted to wait until we know who is the wizard, and have the wizard partake in the	no
1559	transcript	transcript_Bed003	ultimate  sort of definition  probe .	no
1560	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So - so if - if on Friday it turns out that she really likes it and - and we really like her,	no
1561	transcript	transcript_Bed003	then nothing should stop us from sitting down next week and	no
1562	transcript	transcript_Bed003	getting all the details completely figured out.	no
1563	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
1564	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And um -	no
1565	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K. So the ideal task um,	no
1566	transcript	transcript_Bed003	will have  whatever	no
1567	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I don't know how much the structure of the evolving Bayes-net	no
1568	transcript	transcript_Bed003	will af- affect - Like we wanna - we wanna be able to collect  as much of the variables that are needed for that,	no
1569	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mmm-yea-some.	no
1570	transcript	transcript_Bed003	right? in the course of the task?	no
1571	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Well not  all  of them but you know.	no
1572	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Bu- e- e- e- I'm even -	no
1573	transcript	transcript_Bed003	This - this Tango, Enter, Vista is sort of, itself, an ad-hoc scenario.	no
1574	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
1575	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
1576	transcript	transcript_Bed003	The - the  basic  u- um  idea  behind the uh	no
1577	transcript	transcript_Bed003	data collection was the following.	no
1578	transcript	transcript_Bed003	The data we get from Munich is	no
1579	transcript	transcript_Bed003	very command line, simple linguistic stuff.	no
1580	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
1581	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Hardly anything complicated.	no
1582	transcript	transcript_Bed003	No metaphors whatsoever.	no
1583	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
1584	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Not a rich language.	no
1585	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So we wanted just to collect data,	no
1586	transcript	transcript_Bed003	to get -	no
1587	transcript	transcript_Bed003	that - that -	no
1588	transcript	transcript_Bed003	that  elicits  more,	no
1589	transcript	transcript_Bed003	uh,	no
1590	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
1591	transcript	transcript_Bed003	that elicits  richer  language.	no
1592	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And we actually did  not  want to constrain it	no
1593	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
1594	transcript	transcript_Bed003	too  much,	no
1595	transcript	transcript_Bed003	you know? Just see what people say.	no
1596	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And then maybe we'll  discover  the phenomenon -	no
1597	transcript	transcript_Bed003	the  phenomena  that we want to solve,	no
1598	transcript	transcript_Bed003	you know, with	no
1599	transcript	transcript_Bed003	whatever engine we - we come up with.	no
1600	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Um.	no
1601	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So this - this -	no
1602	transcript	transcript_Bed003	this is a parallel track,	no
1603	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
1604	transcript	transcript_Bed003	you know,	no
1605	transcript	transcript_Bed003	there - they hopefully meet,	no
1606	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So in other words this data collection is  more general. It could - it could  be used for not just this task.	no
1607	transcript	transcript_Bed003	but since -	no
1608	transcript	transcript_Bed003	It should	no
1609	transcript	transcript_Bed003	tell us, you know, what kind of phenomenon  could	no
1610	transcript	transcript_Bed003	occur, it should tell us also maybe something about the difference between	no
1611	transcript	transcript_Bed003	people who think they speak to a computer versus people who think they speak to a human being and the sort of differences there.	no
1612	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
1613	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So it may get us some more information on the human-machine pragmatics, um,	no
1614	transcript	transcript_Bed003	that no one knows anything about,	no
1615	transcript	transcript_Bed003	as of yesterday.	no
1616	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And uh -  nothing has changed  since then, so.	no
1617	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Uh.	no
1618	transcript	transcript_Bed003	And secondly,	no
1619	transcript	transcript_Bed003	now that of course we have sort of started to lick blood with this,	no
1620	transcript	transcript_Bed003	and especially since um -	no
1621	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Johno can't stop Tango-ing,	no
1622	transcript	transcript_Bed003	we may actually include, you know,	no
1623	transcript	transcript_Bed003	those - those intentions.	no
1624	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So now I think we  should  maybe have	no
1625	transcript	transcript_Bed003	at least one navigational task with - with sort of  explicit  -	no
1626	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
1627	transcript	transcript_Bed003	uh not  ex-  it's  implicit  that the person wants to enter,	no
1628	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
1629	transcript	transcript_Bed003	and maybe some task where it's more or less explicit	no
1630	transcript	transcript_Bed003	that the person wants to take a picture,	no
1631	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
1632	transcript	transcript_Bed003	or see it or	no
1633	transcript	transcript_Bed003	something.	no
1634	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So that we can label it. I mean,	no
1635	transcript	transcript_Bed003	that's how we get a corpus that we can label.	no
1636	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Mm-hmm.	no
1637	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Exactly.	no
1638	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Whereas, you know,	no
1639	transcript	transcript_Bed003	if we'd just get data we'd never  know  what they actually  wanted,	no
1640	transcript	transcript_Bed003	we'd get no cues.	no
1641	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yep.	no
1642	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Alrighty.	no
1643	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K.	no
1644	transcript	transcript_Bed003	That was that.	no
1645	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So is this the official end of the meeting now?	no
1646	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Yep.	no
1647	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Looks like it.	no
1648	transcript	transcript_Bed003	"So what's ""Economics, the fallacy""?"	no
1649	transcript	transcript_Bed003	I just randomly  label things.	no
1650	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Ma-	no
1651	transcript	transcript_Bed003	So that has nothing to do with economics or anything.	no
1652	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Oh, really? O_K.	no
1653	transcript	transcript_Bed003	Maybe we ought to switch off these things before we continue.	no
1654	transcript	transcript_Bed003	O_K. Switching o-	yes
1655	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Is it on?	no
1656	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	O_K, here we go.	no
1657	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Uh, so - uh, so I c- I definitely have to leave at three-thirty today for  whatever. That's -	no
1658	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So -	no
1659	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Definitely have to go to tea. So -	no
1660	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah, they're - they're having birthday cake and such and so I can't miss that.	no
1661	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	That too, but -	no
1662	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	You're a May birthday, right?	no
1663	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I'm a May birthday, yeah, so I have to -	no
1664	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Oops.	no
1665	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Barbara  told me. Barbara Peskin.	no
1666	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
1667	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Um -	yes
1668	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Um -	no
1669	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So,	no
1670	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	only a couple of agenda items, since no one sent me email for agenda items. Uh, the first is the I_B_M transcripts. I'd like to	no
1671	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	uh,  mention  - I s- I spoke with  several  of you about this, but just to	no
1672	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	brainstorm a little bit about what we can do with it.	no
1673	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
1674	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So we got back the I_B_M transcript, and the  accuracy  looks O_K. There are - I mean, there are areas which are	yes
1675	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
1676	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So we got back the I_B_M transcript, and the  accuracy  looks O_K. There are - I mean, there are areas which are	no
1677	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	clearly wrong and there are a lot of areas where they put  question  marks,	no
1678	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	where the acoustics weren't very good. And I think that's  fine.  Putting it in question marks is better than doing it wrong.	no
1679	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	The  big  problem was, they had the  wrong  number of beeps in it.	no
1680	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Oops.	no
1681	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So it didn't align.	no
1682	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And that's  exactly  what I was  afraid  of.	no
1683	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And I went in, and more or less by  hand,   corrected  it, by loading it - I wrote a script that will convert it to the multi- the Channeltrans format,	no
1684	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	looked at it in - in Channeltrans and	no
1685	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	found the places where it got a- unsynchronized, and then either -	no
1686	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Hmm.	no
1687	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Inserted ones.	no
1688	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And in  this  case only - only had to remove beeps, because that was th-  always  the error,	no
1689	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	is that they put in it  extraneous  beeps. But it's  not  easy to  do,	no
1690	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Hmm.	no
1691	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	because the whole thing gets	no
1692	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	offset, and basically, it's assigning the wrong speaker to the text, and it all gets unaligned. So it's very difficult	no
1693	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Hmm.	no
1694	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	to  do.  So it took me several hours	no
1695	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So this is -	no
1696	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	just to do that.	no
1697	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	For one meeting.	no
1698	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	this is one - it's one hour of - of - of speech?	no
1699	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yep.	no
1700	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And it took you a few hours to - to do it.	no
1701	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	It took me a couple hours to write the scripts, and then	no
1702	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	it - it probably took me	no
1703	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	maybe forty-five minutes,  just  going  through  it. Now obviously it will be a lot  faster  from now  on,  because now I sort of understand how it works.	no
1704	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	But, I think if we had some way - uh some  tool  that made it easier to insert and delete beeps	no
1705	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	it would make it a lot easier. Cuz  one  of the problems is that it takes a very long  time  when you make a change to load it back up in the  channel  transcriber.	no
1706	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yep.	no
1707	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah, that's true. I've noticed that. Yeah.	no
1708	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	One  of the things that  Adam  said that I thought would be a good  idea  would be, um,	no
1709	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And so there  may  be -	no
1710	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Which makes sense.	no
1711	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	if we g- used different  beeps.  So for example if we  alternated  between two beeps, a high and a low.	no
1712	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	He  said that?	no
1713	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	th-	no
1714	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Uh, well in - in some email that, uh, we had.	no
1715	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Oh, on the email.	no
1716	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	For -	no
1717	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Oh, oh, O_K.	no
1718	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
1719	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I didn't  just  say that, no.	no
1720	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah. Um - Because  then  -	no
1721	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So th- so this is the o- the other  approach  which is, what do we do in the  future,  to try to make this less common? But it's  still  gonna happen.	no
1722	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
1723	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well, and then the  other  possibility was - e- that we provide them with a - a file that already has the beeps  in  it or something. Wasn't that what you said?	no
1724	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So -	no
1725	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Hunh.	no
1726	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Sort of a text template, but I don't know how	no
1727	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Uh-huh.	no
1728	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah, we don't know what their process is. So I had two ideas. The first was to provide them a text template that had both the beeps in it and the speaker I_Ds.	no
1729	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	we can do that.	no
1730	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
1731	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	"You know, just ""male-female"", ""English-nonEnglish"", ""one two three four""."	no
1732	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Um -	no
1733	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Can I - I - I just -	no
1734	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And they just filled it in.	no
1735	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	How- how many - how many beeps are there, and how many do we- were they -	no
1736	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	d- were - were off?	no
1737	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	It was like a hundred twenty, and they had a hundred twenty-three or something like that. Is that right?	no
1738	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Alright.	no
1739	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well, l- I- I thought it was a lot  more  than that.	no
1740	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And is it a -	no
1741	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well I - I don't remember.	no
1742	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	They were  three  off, basically.	no
1743	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah, and it was a hundred-ish.	no
1744	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And this is the mixed signal?	no
1745	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Oh!	no
1746	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Hmm.	no
1747	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So - so if you get one -	no
1748	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	uh, uh, excuse me. If you get one off, it - t- everything is off  cuz of the alignment  right?	no
1749	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yep.	no
1750	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yep.	no
1751	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Uh, and this is all in one file that's continuous.	no
1752	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yep.	no
1753	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
1754	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So why don't you make it multiple files?	no
1755	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	How would that help?	no
1756	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Because then if they have one off, then - then it would only screw up that file.	no
1757	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Oh, you mean just break the one hour into	no
1758	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
1759	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	a few chunks.	no
1760	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I mean, it seems now, if you just ha- make one mistake then everything is off.	no
1761	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well the only - the only question about  that  that I have is, um, I think Brian has to put all this stuff onto a  tape.	no
1762	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So I don't know whether -	no
1763	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
1764	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I'm sure they would prefer it sort of one hour.	no
1765	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Can he send them - I guess he could send them multiple	no
1766	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Oh!	no
1767	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	tapes	no
1768	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Uh -	no
1769	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	"Yeah, just say, ""O_K, is -"""	no
1770	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	"ten minutes is -"" I mean,"	no
1771	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	maybe there's other things to do that are more  clever,  but this just seemed to be the sort of the obvious thing because, again, if you make  one   mistake,	no
1772	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	then everything after that mistake is  off.	no
1773	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
1774	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And, uh -	no
1775	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well, the only other issue is we'd have to worry about reassembling them in the proper order.	no
1776	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Uh -	no
1777	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
1778	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	That - I mean, just naming schemes will get -	no
1779	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	We can definitely do that. So t- so one question is, are there good places in the files where we can really do that?	no
1780	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well, the other thing - You can -	no
1781	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I mean, so - so - so someone will have to go through them and listen to them and pick a place to break them.	no
1782	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
1783	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	The  other  thing you  can  do- This is on the mixed signal,  or are these the individual -	no
1784	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	the ones with the beeps that they're getting,	no
1785	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	that they made mistakes on is	no
1786	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	They are played from the	no
1787	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	the  mixed  one?	no
1788	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Individual channels.	no
1789	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Individual channels.	no
1790	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	individual.	no
1791	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Or they're indivi- If it's individual, um -	no
1792	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	y- c- we can -	no
1793	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	probably  run a forced  alignment,	no
1794	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	where you c- include the beeps as words	no
1795	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	and pretty much figure out where the  errors  are.	no
1796	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I don't think we could do it on the  mixed  signal, cuz it -	no
1797	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	But on the individual channels that would probably work,  if  they have enough	no
1798	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	words in the transcript.	no
1799	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah, we - In fact, that's - Yeah, maybe we -	no
1800	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So, I mean, that's pretty quick to run. It - it's, um -	no
1801	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I mean, we could  try  it.	no
1802	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Cuz if a beep is treated as a	no
1803	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	You mean, so, actually put - put the wavefile in with beep in it.	no
1804	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	"unique word, ""beep"" -"	no
1805	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	"Put in - put ""beep"" in as a word."	no
1806	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And pu- and have a beep model.	no
1807	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	We  have  the original  wavefile  with all the beeps.	no
1808	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah. Yeah. Well -	no
1809	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	the beep model - Actually, you could  train  a beep model. That - that's a good idea.	no
1810	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	It would be very good.	no
1811	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Um -	no
1812	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yes, it would be, cuz it's very, very regular.	no
1813	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
1814	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah. So, um -	no
1815	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Oh. Kind of low variance, wouldn't that be?  You sort of  might end up with	no
1816	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
1817	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah,  very  low.	no
1818	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
1819	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Um, that might actually -	no
1820	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	some infinities there, but -	no
1821	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	You have to - may - add some jitter to it.	no
1822	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Can I see that?	no
1823	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I mean, that might actually work, because you'll -	no
1824	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Where's the case?	no
1825	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I guess the trick is figuring out, you know, where it doesn't align?	no
1826	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	But if it's a problem of  extra  beeps,	no
1827	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	rather than  missing  beeps, then -	no
1828	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	um -	no
1829	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	that's easier	no
1830	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	It could t- it could -	no
1831	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	and it might work. Oh.	no
1832	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	There could be some missing ones. But -	no
1833	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So is this a	no
1834	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	It's just in  this  case they were not.	no
1835	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	seven  or something? Or - What is it?	no
1836	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	M_one-hundred.	no
1837	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So I think - uh, Chuck had a good explanation for it which I liked, which is these - they're listening to it and so they write something down, and let's say they miss it, they  rewind.	no
1838	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	M_one-hundred. Oh.	no
1839	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well, they hear the beep again. Was that  that  beep, or was that a  different  beep? So that's why Chuck was suggesting different tones.  My  original thought	no
1840	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Oh, yeah.	no
1841	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	was, you could have a different tone for each  speaker.	no
1842	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	You know, there's plenty of  tone  space.	no
1843	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And that might help  cue	no
1844	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	the  transcriptionist.	no
1845	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	You know, give them a little  cue  about where they  are.	no
1846	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Or you could - you could have ascending tones, or something.	no
1847	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	What do you mean?	no
1848	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Uh -	no
1849	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Or -	no
1850	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
1851	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Increasingly high - higher frequencies.	no
1852	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	"You could have, um, each speaker in the meeting say ""beep"" and record it and that will be their pro-"	no
1853	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	No, I just - thi- I don't know. If you have a hundred or something just - just sort of move them up i- mu- up a - a half tone or something for - for  each one, and then -	no
1854	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Sorry.	no
1855	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	That's  what I was  saying.  Is that - that you could have -  each  speaker could have their own  tone.	no
1856	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Oh was it? Oh.	no
1857	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	See, I should  listen.  Yeah?	no
1858	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Hmm.	no
1859	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And you know, since there are no more than,	no
1860	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	you know, ten speakers or so per meeting,	no
1861	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Oh.	no
1862	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well -	no
1863	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	there's plenty of tone space.	no
1864	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	But -	no
1865	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Uh, O_K, yeah. So the only -	no
1866	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	That  might work too. Yeah, I was just thinking that actually  temporally  just, uh, uh, uh, an increasing tones so that	no
1867	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Oh, O_K.	no
1868	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	they would really have a sense of whether they were going, you know, forward or backward or - Yeah.	no
1869	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Bo-eep  be-oop.	no
1870	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	In the end? Yeah.	no
1871	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well  you th-	no
1872	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So just r- r- truly chron- chromatically up  all the way through the entire meeting.	no
1873	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
1874	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well, it's a thought.	no
1875	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Interesting.	no
1876	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Oh, oh, th- oh, I see.	no
1877	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	It'd be impossible to r- to misorder them.	no
1878	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
1879	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
1880	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	But yo- I guess you'd still get the mistake that  you  mentioned, because	no
1881	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	the person - I mean, if that's some of the errors, those would probably stay the same, regardless.	no
1882	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well -	no
1883	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yep.	no
1884	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	"I mean,  Chuck's  suggestion of just  two  beeps is nice because then you could have them actually  transcribe  ""H_beep"" or ""L_beep"", ""high beep"" or ""low beep""."	no
1885	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah, maybe.	no
1886	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And then when we get  them   back, if we see two L_beeps in a row -	no
1887	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	It would be much easier.	no
1888	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	That's probably better, yeah. S- scratch my other idea.	no
1889	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah, you have like a sanity - sanity check on them. That's a good idea. Alternating.	no
1890	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	It's pretty simple, pretty simple.	no
1891	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
1892	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yep.	no
1893	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
1894	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And it would - it seems like it would help  them,  you know, if they	no
1895	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	just finished a long passage and they heard	no
1896	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	one  beep and then they	no
1897	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	hear it again, they know it's the same  beep.	no
1898	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Versus if they heard a slightly different one.	no
1899	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
1900	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Hmm, interesting.	no
1901	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah, that's a good, like, error checking	no
1902	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	approach, I think.	no
1903	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah, we can,	no
1904	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	yeah, like, do - do, uh,	no
1905	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	"one for each ca- one for each person in the meeting, you can only hire people who have perfect pitch, and they can say ""A_flat""  ""B_""."	no
1906	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	"Well.  Well, ""high"", ""low"" is pretty straightforward, yeah."	no
1907	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Great idea, yeah.	no
1908	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	No, two is probably better than what I was suggesting, because what I was suggesting, in order to make it through a reasonable range for the whole	no
1909	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	thing, you'd have to have the -	no
1910	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	the tonal differences between the two kind of small, and actually you want them large. So.	no
1911	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yep.	no
1912	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	You'd have to - they'd have to have the acoustics of dogs t-  hear into the high high ranges.	no
1913	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
1914	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
1915	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
1916	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So I think,  certainly,  doing two beeps is - is no-brainer. And then the other question is,  if  they can -	no
1917	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	If they	no
1918	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	do  something on a computer in a format we can  handle,  we could give them a text file that was a template with speaker I_D and beeps already in it.	no
1919	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
1920	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And then they could just fill that in.	no
1921	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Maybe I should write to Brian and tell him what the problem  was  and what our proposed solutions are.	no
1922	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So what -	no
1923	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right.	no
1924	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	See what he thinks would work best with  them.	no
1925	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
1926	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I mean, what's going  wrong  on the other end? What are they  doing?  What, uh -	no
1927	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well, as I  said,  I think - We don't  actually  know, but I think Chuck's  hypothesis  was a  good  one, which is, you re- r- you  listen  to something,	no
1928	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	you write down what you thought you heard,	no
1929	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	but you want to listen to it again, so you r- rewind.	no
1930	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And there are some -	no
1931	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	"And then you hear the beep  again, and then you say ""well, is that  that  beep,"	no
1932	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	"or is that a new beep?  I  don't remember."" And so, you know, a  couple  times they got it  wrong."	no
1933	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And there are  some  cases where there's, um,	no
1934	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	very little  speech  before you hear a beep. So you hear a little bit of speech, beep, a little bit of speech, beep.	no
1935	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
1936	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
1937	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Maybe three of those in a  row,  and was that  three  beeps, was that  two  beeps?	no
1938	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Um - See, they have th- Brian said the setup that they  have  is, um -	no
1939	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	uh -	no
1940	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	i- um -	no
1941	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	They've got headphones and  then  I guess they have a computer, and they have a foot pedal which lets them quickly	no
1942	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	scan back and forth through the tape. I- i- t- i- s- makes the tape go real fast forward or fast backward.	no
1943	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And so they can  hear  something, then step on the pedal and quickly rewind	no
1944	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	and go back and hear it  again.  And so they're -	no
1945	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I  think  they're probably going over and  over  f- sections. And then they get  confused  about whether	no
1946	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	they've already  put that beep, or if they heard, you know, three beeps in a row, was that  three  or  two,  and -	no
1947	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	It's a  shame  we can't  really  give a  number.  So it would be a  number   and  a  beep.	no
1948	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	O_K, s-	no
1949	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	e-	no
1950	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	It's a shame we can't do that.	no
1951	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well, we  could.	no
1952	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Oh,   that's  an interesting idea.	no
1953	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	We  could,  but then that starts getting	no
1954	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	pretty  long.	no
1955	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	No, no, no. But  wait,  maybe -	no
1956	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	maybe what we  have  instead of a  beep  is a, uh, synthesized  number.	no
1957	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yep.	no
1958	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And they put the  number  in when they hear it.	no
1959	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	That'll  work.	no
1960	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	"So, inst-  replacing   the beep with ""twenty- three "","	no
1961	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	"""twenty- four "","	no
1962	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	"""twenty-five"" -  And then they have to transcribe what that  number  is each time."	no
1963	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Wow, that'd  also  be shorter to  type.	no
1964	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	"Yeah, just a ""two three, two four"", that would be -"	no
1965	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well, they would have to have a mark.	no
1966	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Interesting.	no
1967	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	There'd be some kind of mark in front of it.	no
1968	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well, cuz they're s- distinguishing between twenty-three -	no
1969	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	that's your  indicator  there, and twenty-three that somebody happens to  say  in a  meeting.	no
1970	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Oh, that's true.	no
1971	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well it would have t- yeah, it would have to be um,	no
1972	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	you know either obviously a s- sounding synthesized, uh, little -	no
1973	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
1974	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	But they might miss that, right?	no
1975	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Or maybe could it be a  click  and the  number.	no
1976	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
1977	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Or a  beep  and the number.	no
1978	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well, it's sequential.	no
1979	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Or a beep and the number, and then - and then you just do the - the num- th- you do it as a d- a digit.	no
1980	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right, you would go sequential. So unless you got pretty unlucky,	no
1981	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Uh, right.	no
1982	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
1983	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	what the person was saying and the number -	no
1984	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	"In  fact,  we could put it at the  beginning  of each utterance. We could say ""beep"	no
1985	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	"one ""."	no
1986	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And then they'll hear the speech.	no
1987	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I think having a beep too is good.	no
1988	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So beep number. Yeah the- It's just getting pretty  long.  You know, the utterances are very  short.	no
1989	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Or a number beep -	no
1990	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yep.	no
1991	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
1992	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	"And so you're gonna be talking beep, number, ""yes!"" beep, number, ""no""."	no
1993	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
1994	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well, if - if it saves time, yeah.	no
1995	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah,  and u- I think it would - I -  Actually,  I thi- I  like  that. I think it would -	no
1996	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And when they transcribe  this  meeting it's gonna be  really   impossible.	no
1997	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah,  that's funny.	no
1998	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	"W- we're  saying  ""beep"". Yeah -  for instance."	no
1999	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah, yep.	no
2000	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2001	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	But see that would - that would  definitely  keep -	no
2002	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	It's not a bad idea.	no
2003	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah. Keep	no
2004	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	things from getting out of  sequence.  If they  heard  it  over  again they would  know.  It would be  obvious  from their  transcript  whether they  did  that one or not.	no
2005	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	It might actually  help   them   in terms of their  place  holding. Yeah.	no
2006	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	That  would  help get them synchronized.	no
2007	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2008	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And it might be helpful to  them  in terms of d- act-	no
2009	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I think it  would  be, because they would know their  place.  Yeah.	no
2010	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And we have plenty of  digits  data, so.	no
2011	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	They would know their place, darn it!	no
2012	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	We-	no
2013	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Know -	no
2014	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Those transcriptionists need to know their place.	no
2015	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Oh.	no
2016	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well,  no  no no no.	no
2017	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	But it sounds like a k- a - a - a short conversation with Brian might be - might be helpful to get a sense of what's going on.	no
2018	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah. I'll - I'll - I'll write him an -	no
2019	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah, the  numbers  are a good idea.	no
2020	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	O_K.	no
2021	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2022	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Or just -	no
2023	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Othe- other than  lengthening  the  transcript,	no
2024	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I think it would be very helpful.	no
2025	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Just instead of the sequential number, for-	no
2026	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	perhaps just the speaker I_D  or something. Just say speaker one  or spea- or just one, two, three, four  for four speakers or something.	no
2027	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Pppt!	no
2028	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I - i-	no
2029	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Could - could be helpful.	no
2030	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah, you don't have to -	no
2031	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	you  could  keep  them   short by not s- or just go one through ten, one through ten, one through ten, or one through twenty.	no
2032	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2033	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2034	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2035	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yep.	no
2036	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And then  also,  if we - I mean, I don't know what their  setup  is, but your  template  idea might be a way of - of	no
2037	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
2038	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	of - We could actually  build  the numbers  into  a template.	no
2039	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yep.	no
2040	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well.	no
2041	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I'll talk to Brian, and see what he -	no
2042	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah,  single  digit numbers -	no
2043	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2044	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	That also appeals to me. So that you don't have to, you know -	no
2045	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	That's a good idea.	no
2046	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Very simple.	no
2047	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	"""One hundred twenty-four"""	no
2048	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2049	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2050	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well, th- although -	no
2051	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	"""Beep. One thousand three hundred forty-two"""	no
2052	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	You're saying i- it's - it's about an hour meeting, and there were a hundred and twenty-three -	no
2053	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
2054	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I don't remember.	no
2055	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	It's forty-five minutes.	no
2056	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Chuck was saying there was more than that.	no
2057	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Hmm?	no
2058	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Forty-five minutes for  that  one.	no
2059	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	More  beeps than that.	no
2060	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I  was thinking there was on the order of	no
2061	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	fifteen  hundred  segments, but maybe I'm -	no
2062	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	There  must  be. Because  otherwise,  you're going a whole -	no
2063	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I think it should be more, yeah.	no
2064	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	It's  possible.	no
2065	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	That was	no
2066	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	at least forty-five minutes, right?	no
2067	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah. That's right.	no
2068	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Was it that many? I just don't recall.	no
2069	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah, it was forty-five minutes.	no
2070	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	That's the shortest meeting we  have.  Most of them are  double  that, or	no
2071	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yep.	no
2072	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well, I was just wondering what the average length	no
2073	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	so	no
2074	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Oh, of a - of a segment that they're hearing?	no
2075	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	thing  was.	no
2076	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	It's -	no
2077	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2078	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I don't know.	no
2079	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Hmm, interesting.	no
2080	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I don't know.	no
2081	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Uh-	no
2082	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Easy enough to figure out. We have all that data.	no
2083	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2084	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So if there  are  in the -	no
2085	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	in the  hundreds  and thou- or  thousands  of these -	no
2086	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	It  must  be in the high  hundreds  of them, at  least.	no
2087	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So, right. So i-	no
2088	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So that's getting a little cumbersome for them to type, like,	no
2089	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2090	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well,  with  just  one  digit  though,	no
2091	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	five hundred?	no
2092	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I think -	no
2093	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well -	no
2094	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	But yeah, if they recycle through -	no
2095	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah, if we - if we did mod ten, then -	no
2096	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2097	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right, but my  point  was, you know, if - It's a  big  difference to me if there's a  thousand  or there's a  hundred.  If	no
2098	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	there's a  thousand,  then that means	no
2099	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	that this is only happening  three  times out of a  thousand.	no
2100	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Which means, you know, even just splitting it up into a few  files  would probably take - You know, nearly all the  time,  there would be no -	no
2101	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2102	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	W- if it's a  hundred,  then - you know, that's  not  the issue,  but if it's a hundred,	no
2103	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	then, the average  length  of each one is pretty - pretty  long  and so having a little thing at the front of it is no big  deal.	no
2104	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
2105	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So,  that's  why I was  curious.	no
2106	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah,  you're  right. It  had  to have been more than that. I mean, it was a forty-five minute meeting, so -	no
2107	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right.	no
2108	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And it certainly was not a minute a chunk, it was a few  seconds  a chunk.	no
2109	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	That's what I -	no
2110	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
2111	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah, so it'd be a lot of overhead to type.	no
2112	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So I'm just mis-remembering.	no
2113	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I'm just mis-remembering.	no
2114	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Oh, I -	no
2115	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So.	no
2116	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well, and the  other  thing is, maybe the numbers would help them keep their place in the transcript and speed the process -	no
2117	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2118	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	It might make the transcript faster - W- wel- I mean I - A quick conversation with Brian would be good, so.	no
2119	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2120	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
2121	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2122	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	O_K.	no
2123	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And other than that -	no
2124	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Actually, if it  is  -	no
2125	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	u-	no
2126	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I mean, it's not a bad	no
2127	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	idea to  try  the alignment.	no
2128	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Um, if there's only like  three  of  them,	no
2129	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	then	no
2130	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	if you  align,  the first point at which things get messed up is sort of the location of the first problem.	no
2131	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
2132	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And then, the second p- I mean,	no
2133	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	you could  do  it that way, or you could -	no
2134	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	It's - it's -	no
2135	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	it would be	no
2136	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	able to handle any errors. So if they make, on the average, that  many,	no
2137	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right.	no
2138	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	and it costs them more time to do something different than what they're doing, which I don't know,  but if it  does,	no
2139	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	then we could  try  doing that as a post-process, and,	no
2140	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	um, have a student or a transcriber run this alignment, or we can do it and -	no
2141	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yep.	no
2142	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	You know  actually,  what - all that we would -	no
2143	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	then you can iteratively	no
2144	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	figure out  where the problems are.	no
2145	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	You know, Liz, all we would re-	no
2146	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	It would take a  little  work, but not any real human - not a lot of human work.	no
2147	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right. I mean,  that's  what we want to avoid.	no
2148	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I mean if - in terms of the alignment, actually, all we would need is - we wouldn't even need  words.  We would need a  general  speech model and a  beep  model.	no
2149	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Cuz all we're really  concerned  about is missing beeps or too  many  beeps.	no
2150	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well, the for- the  forced  alignment will run fa- otherwise it'll take forever. I mean,	no
2151	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So if we had a -	no
2152	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
2153	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	to really run recognition?	no
2154	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well - l- I guess what I'm  thinking  of is that w-	no
2155	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Or - ?	no
2156	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	that a lot of times	no
2157	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	there will be - they'll put in question marks,	no
2158	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	that represent some unknown amount of speech, so we're gonna have to have some kind of -	no
2159	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right.	no
2160	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah, then we just map it to a  reject  model.	no
2161	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	In - and in fact, that's what we do  now.  Cuz there's cases, even after  Jane  listens, where, you know, we have -	no
2162	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right, h-	no
2163	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	an  expert  can't even tell what they're talking about.	no
2164	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2165	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Um, so that's O_K. Just map that to reject and -	no
2166	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right.	no
2167	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well, what I was  thinking  is, map  all  the speech to the  reject  model. And then you have a  beep  model.	no
2168	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2169	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	But that won't  work  because it's -	no
2170	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah, you're still talking a forced al-	no
2171	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	The forced alignment might not work then,  although we can  try  it.	no
2172	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Um -	no
2173	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well, but, all we'll get -	no
2174	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well, with the beep models, is what's really - you'd have really g- it would be really good though. So -	no
2175	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	The beep model is - is gonna match, like,  really  well.	no
2176	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right.	no
2177	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	so it's p- so it's really just doing, yeah, a keyword, like a spotting for beep with -	no
2178	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right. But it'll - it'll grab the next beep, in other words. It'll be -	no
2179	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	You'll get back another offset.	no
2180	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	"Um - I mean, I was  thinking  of - then I - and then I realized ""Well,"	no
2181	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	the recognizer will just go along and line up all the beeps,	no
2182	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	and then there'll be all the extra beeps at the end  if there were more beeps then you	no
2183	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	"wanted."""	no
2184	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right, you - you  need  - But you  need  the  text	no
2185	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So you need the word - you need the word to c- sort of control the relative location.	no
2186	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	to tell it where it got it  wrong.  Yeah.	no
2187	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	No, I'm not sug- I'm not suggesting that we don't have anything  between  the beeps.	no
2188	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	It will tell you -	no
2189	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Oh.	no
2190	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	But I - what I'm saying is, what's  between  the beeps we don't really  care  about.	no
2191	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I think you  do  care about it.	no
2192	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Because you have to know which ones match which.	no
2193	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Unless  you wanna know if they're -	no
2194	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right. Otherwise you just count up the total	no
2195	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And we can do that with  wordcount.	no
2196	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	number of beeps.	no
2197	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right? We  already  know that - that we're three  short.  And so if we just did	no
2198	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2199	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	spee- uh beep and non-beep all you would  get  is that you have three  mistakes,  but you wouldn't tell you which ones were  wrong.	no
2200	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right.	no
2201	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	"You need some of the  words  in there, so that you can say ""well,  this  segment matches  this  one,  this  segment matches  this  one, and  this  one doesn't match at  all,"	no
2202	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	"unless we insert a  beep ""."	no
2203	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I mean  the  only  thing I'm worried about with that approach is that if	no
2204	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	O_K.	no
2205	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	we need to	no
2206	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	figure out the beep	no
2207	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	alignment problem	no
2208	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	before the transcribers do the corrections here,  then we're in trouble. In other words, if the transcripts aren't sort of	no
2209	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	good enough that the aligner	no
2210	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	constraints are good enough to sort of	no
2211	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	show you where the errors are, then	no
2212	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	it wouldn't work. But it  might  work. It might work to do this if their transcripts are pretty close	no
2213	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	on the words that usually get recognized correctly, which are the,	no
2214	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	you know, function words, the  common  words.	no
2215	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well, actually, you know, there's an even easier way. We don't really need a beep model.	no
2216	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Um, just extract the segments and do a forced alignment,	no
2217	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right, you can also -	no
2218	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	and if the score is  good,  then you say it matches -	no
2219	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	In fact that's what we do -	no
2220	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right. The individual segments  between  the beeps -	no
2221	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Um, if beeps were like the segments that we get from	no
2222	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	um, the transcription tool  already,  that  that's  what we have  done,  and it works  very  well. You can see these	no
2223	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	segments align and these don't.	no
2224	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Um, then you just have to go back in and figure out where the endpoints of those segments are, cuz some of them will be wrong.	no
2225	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Because the bi- the beeps were missing, by  definition.	no
2226	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right.	no
2227	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So do you get a score for each alignment? Is that what you get?	no
2228	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So it might actually work.	no
2229	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Um, you ca- you get, um -	no
2230	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Definitely when they don't align at all, it - it - it  fails.	no
2231	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I mean, that - that's how we found a lot of	no
2232	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
2233	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	problems  before,  with, um, words being on the wrong place or something.	no
2234	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So a  failed  alignment is a very good indicator that -	no
2235	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
2236	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	that -	no
2237	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	the words don't match up.	no
2238	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I'm just wondering when - wha- what it means to fail.	no
2239	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Um -	no
2240	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Is it the - the likelihood scores below some threshold -	no
2241	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah, is, uh - it - Right.	no
2242	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	It can't match up the -	no
2243	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	That's why you actually need the text. In order to force you to try to match something that gives you a model to match against.	no
2244	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So - It's just an idea, if -	no
2245	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	if it turns out that -	no
2246	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I mean, I  also  like this idea of high and low beeps, or -	no
2247	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	But it - if -	no
2248	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Suppose we get  one  or  two  errors,  still,  per -	no
2249	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	you know, per transcript, then we z-	no
2250	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	we might wanna try some approach like that.	no
2251	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well, the  numbered  ones would make it a lot easier, cuz you could then really localize where the error is.	no
2252	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
2253	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2254	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Where it is.	no
2255	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right.	no
2256	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2257	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	If - so, if that doesn't add time for  them,  that'd be great. You know, like -	no
2258	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yep.	no
2259	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I think it would  save  them time. I think it would help them keep the track -  track  of it.	no
2260	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	We have to ask them.	no
2261	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Uh - uh, again, especially if there's hundred - many hundreds or thousands I still think it would - it would cut the incidence of this a lot if it was possible to break it into a couple files.	no
2262	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Interesting, yeah.	no
2263	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.  Cuz it, you know, it's r- r-	no
2264	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I guess  also  even for the  transcribers,	no
2265	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	it's quicker to load a smaller file -	no
2266	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	into the - You know, t- for the checking problem.	no
2267	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah, I mean, we could certainly break the meetings -	no
2268	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Into	no
2269	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	We could  certainly   break the meetings into pi- pieces.	no
2270	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	twenty minutes chunks or something, or -	no
2271	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So, just -	no
2272	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I mean, you've already broken them into  chunks,  so if you have - if you have a th- if you have a thousand chunks then	no
2273	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Just -	no
2274	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Just accumulate it till you get twenty minutes worth?	no
2275	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	make  ten things of a hundred, or - or you know.	no
2276	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	There's one file.	no
2277	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	That's  true, yeah.	no
2278	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yep.	no
2279	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And then it will be, you know, this - Eve- every now and then there'll be a - a beep missing.	no
2280	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So, someone's gonna talk to Brian.	no
2281	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah, I'll -	no
2282	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I think that was  Chuck.	no
2283	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I'll talk to him.	no
2284	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	O_K.	no
2285	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yep.	no
2286	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I also looked thr- over the text and I was impressed by the accuracy, it looks really good.	no
2287	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah, it  does  look good. I mean, I found several errors, but they were not	no
2288	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	significant.	no
2289	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	They were all things that I could easily listen to and	no
2290	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	sometimes convince myself they said one thing and sometimes the other, so.	no
2291	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah, it's there. Mm-hmm.	no
2292	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I haven't looked at these, um -	no
2293	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	cuz I was gone last week, but -	no
2294	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	but Don had told me that there's a difference in some of the conventions?	no
2295	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Oh. Yes. But this is not important. It's systematic, yeah.	no
2296	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So - but those are all  easy  things, right?	no
2297	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2298	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	O_K.	no
2299	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And - and Brian actually forwarded me in advance. He - he wor- he very nicely worked out	no
2300	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	a set of  conventions   which is intermediate between ours and the ones that they're  used  to. Which is - which is really a good - a good way to do it.	no
2301	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	O_K.	no
2302	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So we can just map -	no
2303	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	map them to -	no
2304	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	No problem.	no
2305	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Great.	no
2306	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Hmm.	no
2307	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	O_K.	yes
2308	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	O_K.	no
2309	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Um -	no
2310	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	We still haven't really sat down and talked about file reorganization,  and directory reorganization. So we still have to do that.	no
2311	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	But I don't think we need to do that in this meeting.	no
2312	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	But, uh -	no
2313	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	It  is  something that needs to get done, and I wanna  also  coordinate it with Dave so that we do a level zero backup right after.	no
2314	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So we don't waste a lot of tapes.	no
2315	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	But, uh -	no
2316	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So - let's - let's try to  do  that sometime, O_K?  ch- O_K?	no
2317	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah. We can do it this week.	no
2318	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2319	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Um -	no
2320	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	We also still  have to make a decision about  mike  issues, what we wanna  do  with that.	no
2321	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I thought we were going to get two more of the	no
2322	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	ones -	no
2323	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And just swap  them   in and out?	no
2324	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah, we could certainly do that.	no
2325	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So why not?	no
2326	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So -	no
2327	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	uh, Morgan, just to -	no
2328	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	uh, since you weren't at the meeting  last  week, uh, apparently a bunch of the E_D_U fe- folks really hate this style mike.	no
2329	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Um, I wouldn't - well, it -	no
2330	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	"they didn't say ""hate"" but they -"	no
2331	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	they c- they come on time to their meetings in order to not be  left  the last person who has to sit by those	no
2332	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Can I - I c- I -	no
2333	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I mean, that's - that's -  that's  a fairly strong indication of dislike.	no
2334	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	mikes.	no
2335	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I  actually really like  them   though.	no
2336	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Um -	no
2337	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Which one is these? The uh -	no
2338	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	There were a few people - you, and like, three or four people who  really  like them.	no
2339	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	The Crown.	no
2340	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Uh-huh.	no
2341	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah,  I  do.	no
2342	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And e- and th- all the others	no
2343	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	really don't.	no
2344	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So what I was  thinking  is, we could  get  a few more of the  Sony  ones and just unplug  them   and plug  them   in. And the only thing is that	no
2345	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	when you fill out the  digit  forms, you have to be sure to indicate which mike was actually used.	no
2346	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So, I mean, that's easy to do. Um -	no
2347	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	it - it -	no
2348	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	moves us  away  from this uniform, all the mikes are the  same,  which some people had said was a benefit.	no
2349	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	But -	no
2350	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	The  other  thing,  too,  is th- y-  you  said that the acoustic pra- q- quality of the one that you're  wearing,  the  fancy  one, is actually somewhat  better  than	no
2351	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	It  is.	no
2352	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2353	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So I- I don't know if it's a noticeable  difference,  but it is -	no
2354	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I mean, I p- I personally really  prefer  that model, so I think you know we've got this problem of people having different -	no
2355	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	different preferences.	no
2356	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	You know, there are  so  many things about this that are non-uniform that I think having -	no
2357	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	having  some  modicum of uniformity is a good thing, but you're just not going to - I mean we've -	no
2358	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	O_K.	no
2359	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	uh -	no
2360	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	For instance, jus- just the fact that people sit in different positions, different times, the - exactly where they put it with respect to their mouth is different each time.	no
2361	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yep.	no
2362	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Uh -	no
2363	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I - I just don't - I mean, I think we - we're - we're getting rid of  major  differences like we're not using the lapel anymore, an- and so forth. But	no
2364	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
2365	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	the other stuff is just gonna - some variability we're gonna have to accept.	no
2366	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	It's - I - I understand, that's fine with me. I - I g-  would  say that um, I find this model easier to  adjust,  that's one of the reasons I don't like  these,  cuz I keep m-	no
2367	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Uh-huh.	no
2368	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	you know, bending it, and then it's n- and I never really know -	no
2369	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah, see I - I happen to like the old one better.	no
2370	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	You do? O_K.	no
2371	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	But -	no
2372	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2373	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	What about just a different  headband  thing?	no
2374	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And some people do, but -	no
2375	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Or even if we could attach two headband - Like, I don't  mind  those, but it -	no
2376	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I mean -	no
2377	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	th-	no
2378	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	We abs- th-	no
2379	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	We have lots o- of choices of microphones. So -	no
2380	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	they bounce around.	no
2381	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I mean, can we keep the  microphones,  and just	no
2382	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
2383	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	somehow attach a more comfortable	no
2384	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	thing over your head?	no
2385	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mmm.	no
2386	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2387	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	That's  my  problem  with this one. The -	no
2388	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	the  ear  thing comes out to  here.  It doesn't even  fit  over my  ear.	no
2389	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right.	no
2390	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Hmm.	no
2391	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And for some of the others, it's - their ears were shaped in a way that	no
2392	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	didn't hold the -	no
2393	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right.	no
2394	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	@@  Huh.	no
2395	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I mean, so we can go microphone shopping, and get - get more microphones. It's just - w-	no
2396	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Then they have to be rewired though, don't they?	no
2397	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I'm just not sure what we should do.	no
2398	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2399	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	You know. I mean, here's another argument against worrying too much about uniformity. We have something like forty-five hours of data collected.	no
2400	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Specially.	no
2401	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And, uh, we're also gonna be integrating in this corpus stuff that's - that's being done at U_W,	no
2402	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yep.	no
2403	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	uh, with entirely different microphones. So I - I think,	no
2404	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	you know,	no
2405	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	getting away from the lapel,	no
2406	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	having close-mounted mikes, having people adjust them as they're most - as - as - as comfortable as they can -	no
2407	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well, I -	no
2408	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I think that's sort of the big deal.	no
2409	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I  agree with that, and so  my  feeling is,	no
2410	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	we should get mikes that people like.	no
2411	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2412	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2413	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And so I-  my  feeling is, going out and buying a few more  mikes  is  fine.	no
2414	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2415	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah, that's right.	no
2416	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So should I just go  do  that?	no
2417	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2418	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	O_K.	no
2419	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	What about these -	no
2420	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And then also, should we go ahead and get another  wireless  system?	no
2421	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	You know, for whatever it's gonna be, uh -	no
2422	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
2423	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Uh, another wireless system.	no
2424	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	You mean, another  transmitter?  Or - or -	no
2425	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Uh, no, actually, get - we need another box. Because each - each box in the back room can only take six.	no
2426	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Oh, to get r- to get rid of the wired things. Yes, absolutely.	no
2427	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So we could-	no
2428	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yep.	no
2429	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	O_K.	no
2430	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2431	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Uh, because - cuz we've had - With the exception of forgetting to change the batteries from time to time, uh, we've really had no tr-  no  trouble with this at all, right? And -	no
2432	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So I'll just go d- I'll do that.	no
2433	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yep.	no
2434	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	and the wired stuff is just gonna continue to degrade as, you know, and	no
2435	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	nobody will remember how to -	no
2436	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Another one just bit the dust.	no
2437	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	yeah, nobody will remember how to repair a Jimbox or a Jimlet or a - you know, it's -	no
2438	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Really?	no
2439	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I  think  there's a problem with this one.	no
2440	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yep.	no
2441	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	O_K. Then I will just go do that, and send the bill to -	no
2442	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2443	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	uh,  what's-her-name.	no
2444	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Whoever will pay, yeah.	no
2445	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Whoever will pay.  You.	no
2446	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah, yeah.	no
2447	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I have a quick question about microphones, um -	no
2448	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I got -	no
2449	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	this crazy idea that, um, i-	no
2450	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	in the future, people	no
2451	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	will just walk around with	no
2452	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	the microphones that they use for their cell phones?	no
2453	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	You know, these little boom ones,	no
2454	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	like, and really go to meetings with close talking mikes. If they're their own personal microphone.	no
2455	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And so I'm wondering if	no
2456	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	we can get a couple of tho- I don't know how good  quality  they are, but it would be really interesting to see if they're good  enough.	no
2457	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Do you mean the kind that hang from the ear, sort of thing, or the -	no
2458	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	The k- kind that guys that like to look like they're really cool at  airports  wear.	no
2459	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2460	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2461	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah, but I don't know  that  one. So what's that mean?	no
2462	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	This - it's - it's a cell phone jack.	no
2463	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Oh, yeah, you do.	no
2464	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	You  can't   miss  it.	no
2465	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	You cannot miss it. They're the guys going around - they're probably talking to nobody, but	no
2466	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Is this - just this little -	no
2467	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Oh they - they have little headsets? Or what do they -	no
2468	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yep.	no
2469	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Th- d-	no
2470	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yes. They wear the heads-	no
2471	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yep.	no
2472	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	E- Well,  there  you go. Yes. That's - that - it looks sort of like  that.	no
2473	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Oh you've - you've  got  one.	no
2474	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Except that one's even bigger than most of the ones I've seen. Most of the ones are just a little boom.	no
2475	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So where - where does - how do you  wear  that? What does that -	no
2476	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	You - you put it over the corner of your ear.	no
2477	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah, over the corner of the ear -	no
2478	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I can't - I'm having competing microphone -  headphone  problems here.	no
2479	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	There's  another  kind which s- goes  in  your ear and it hangs down. There's a little b-   bulb	no
2480	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Huh.	no
2481	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yep. It just ha- just hangs down there. Yeah.	no
2482	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah,  that  I've seen. Yeah.	no
2483	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	that hangs - has the mike on it.	no
2484	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	O_K, so whatever people sort of	no
2485	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	This one.	no
2486	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	wear to use l- Yeah, something like tha- with their cell phones,	no
2487	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
2488	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2489	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	it'd be really great, I think, if we can argue t- that -	no
2490	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	It's an interesting idea.	no
2491	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	people  like  that.	no
2492	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	The  acoustics  -	no
2493	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	the acoustics on this are really s- m-  better  than when I talk into it directly.	no
2494	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah. The - the biggest issue is the stupid cable	no
2495	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	But - what -	no
2496	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Are they?	no
2497	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Why would it be cool?	no
2498	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	that Sony -	no
2499	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	The connector that Sony has, that, uh -	no
2500	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Oh, O_K.	no
2501	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So it's - they're not compatible?	no
2502	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	It's non-standard,	no
2503	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	and so you can't just plug something in. You need to get it wired.	no
2504	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Oh, I'm sorry. You're talking about that as a possible thing to plug into the Sonys. No?	no
2505	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well,	no
2506	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	um, just as an example for,	no
2507	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right.	no
2508	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	How standard are these?	no
2509	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Works with  this.  I don't know.	no
2510	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	you know, the future, of the fact that maybe people  will  wear those microphones, or  some  people might,	no
2511	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	to meetings, you know.	no
2512	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well, some people will, yeah.	no
2513	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Not a - I'm not saying there's not a far-field microphone,	no
2514	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	uh, application, but -	no
2515	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	If we have a choi- I've always wondered how well they would work.	no
2516	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	It  is  an interesting idea. If we could build an  adaptor  that went from - cuz I think  mine  looks like this  too.  If we had  this  style plug that went to  that,	no
2517	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right.	no
2518	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	then we'd just have adaptors and people would plug  them    in.	no
2519	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	You could use - they could use their own.	no
2520	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Oh, right. So they could use the -	no
2521	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I wonder if you  could  do an adaptor. I don't know if you can or not.	no
2522	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Anyway, it's just an idea. Um -	no
2523	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2524	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	An adaptor might be a better idea than do- redoing the wiring all the time.	no
2525	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mmm.	no
2526	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well, I mean, another s-	no
2527	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	An- another side to that is that, um, in  principle,  uh, if it	no
2528	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	all comes together, supposedly we're gonna get two	no
2529	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	um, I_RAM boards.	no
2530	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right.	no
2531	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Uh, little later on in the year.	no
2532	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And so, we're gonna wanna be thinking in terms of some	no
2533	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	wireless connection	no
2534	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
2535	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	to it.	no
2536	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Um,	no
2537	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	so we have, you know, some kind of little something,	no
2538	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	and, uh, we have a wireless connection, this board, that's doing the computation for the f- the, uh -	no
2539	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	the recognition.	no
2540	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And so, you know, we wanna be able to show off to somebody,	no
2541	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	you know, we have a base station somewhere, and	no
2542	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	you're wandering around, uh,	no
2543	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	hands free, and -	no
2544	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yep.	no
2545	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I don't understand. So - so there's a mike that plugs in -	no
2546	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	You're saying there's a mike that plugs in to the  I_RAM  board? or -	no
2547	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	No, no, what I'm saying is that we're gonna have to put together  some  kind of a	no
2548	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	little superstructure, d-  some  sort of demo box that it - that doesn't	no
2549	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Demo.	no
2550	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	do a whole lot, but it somehow connects  to  -	no
2551	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	uh, remotely  to  this I_RAM board which will be doing the real computation.	no
2552	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Oh, I see.	no
2553	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	In other words, we're - we're not gonna attempt to build, uh, it -	no
2554	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	do the real work of building a portable device that's little, that	no
2555	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	is doing all the computation we wanna do for the recognition and the far-field mike, uh,	no
2556	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	compensation and all that stuff. So we're gonna do all that on this powerful board,	no
2557	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	and, uh, have some wireless connection to it. And then the question is what is -	no
2558	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	what does it look like, does it look like	no
2559	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	something that you - you	no
2560	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	hold like  this,  or do we make a big deal out of it that you hold it arm - at arm's length th- so that you can see some  display,	no
2561	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	or, uh,	no
2562	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	do we  have  one of these - You know. I don't know.	no
2563	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So, it th- these are all possibilities.	no
2564	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yep.	no
2565	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I mean, what  I  was envisioning was a P_D_A with a cellular link in it.	no
2566	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	You know, with one of the r-	no
2567	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	short-range wireless.	no
2568	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And let th-	no
2569	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Just do - capture the audio on the P_D_A and send the audio over the	no
2570	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	wireless net.	no
2571	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah. So, is- is  Bluetooth  the sort of thing that'd be, uh -	no
2572	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	But.	no
2573	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Uh, Bluetooth is shorter range, but you could use Bluetooth.	no
2574	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Wh- whatever the network guys already have hooked up for this floor. I don't remember what it's called.	no
2575	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Hmm.	no
2576	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	O_K,   then uh,	yes
2577	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	O_K,   then uh,	no
2578	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	another issue on file reorganization is, uh,	no
2579	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	making data available to people outside ICSI.	no
2580	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So, specifically, the U_ W  folks have been	no
2581	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	wanting to get  access  to it. So I think the right thing to do for that, is figure out how to do C_V_S without	no
2582	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	uh, compromising security. Some pass- S_S_H tunneled	no
2583	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	C_V_S,	no
2584	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well, I- I was -	no
2585	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	and then give them access.	no
2586	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I was reading through some of the C_V_S documentation and you  can  just  substitute  C_V_S for your R_S_ H  command.	no
2587	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yes, except that the command has to  not  take a  password.	no
2588	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Hmm.	no
2589	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Because it- it's non-interactive. And so the only way to  do  that is with, uh -	no
2590	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	S_hosts , which is insecure.	no
2591	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Hmm.	no
2592	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So we  still  have to sort of  look  at it a little bit. I mean, I'm  sure  it's been  solved,  and I just haven't found the solution yet.	no
2593	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	But I am sure that people have done it because it's gonna be a problem a lot of people have.	no
2594	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	But, um -	no
2595	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Who - Well, we're s- talking about a fairly limited group, are - are - is it a small enough group that they would - could just have accounts? Does that solve anything?	no
2596	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Uh, n- n-	no
2597	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	not  really,  because then we have the coordination issue.	no
2598	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I mean, so  one  thing they could do - I mean, I guess that's true.  They could simply log in to ICSI	no
2599	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2600	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well they're gonna have to have accounts -	no
2601	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	and do everything locally.	no
2602	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	If they use S_S_H they have to have an account anyways.	no
2603	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah, except they could share one.	no
2604	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well, but that's not -	no
2605	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	The, uh -	no
2606	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	the S_S_H accounts, and the	no
2607	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	user accounts don't have to be similar.	no
2608	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So.	no
2609	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I mean, there are lots of ways of doing it, but w- but	no
2610	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	if we can't figure out a remote way of doing it, just letting them log in to ICSI	no
2611	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	might be O_K.	no
2612	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
2613	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So the intention was to put everything except the audio files themselves under revision control.	no
2614	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And the audio files, it's not worth doing cuz they're too big. You're never gonna be copying them around	no
2615	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	and making working copies of them.	no
2616	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right.	no
2617	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And then the other issue Jane and I spoke of   briefly  is just general permission issues.	no
2618	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	"That right now, lots of people create the files and then we have group ""Meeting Recorder""."	no
2619	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	But that means anyone in the Meeting Recorder  group  can overwrite the files.	no
2620	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And so that's a pretty coarse level of  granularity. So we  might  wanna think about doing a Meeting Recorder user -  owner	no
2621	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	for those files, and then doing group slightly differently. But -	no
2622	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Can you just do, like, S_U_X or something to modify -	no
2623	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I think what we have now -	no
2624	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I mean, if you just have one user that -	no
2625	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Another option is to m-	no
2626	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	make a non-	no
2627	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	make it owned by a not real user, and then  root  will be able to do it.	no
2628	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	But  root  is pretty tightly controlled here.	no
2629	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I had another thought.	no
2630	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
2631	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So th- I don't think that's a good solution.	no
2632	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Would - w- would it be possi- There are scripts that uh, run,	no
2633	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	and - and when it's finished compressing, would it be possible for the script to change the permissions on the file to be more strict?	no
2634	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Have  them   -	no
2635	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yes,  but if you do that, then someone who isn't the owner can't	no
2636	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	unchange  it.	no
2637	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	But after the meeting's done, would they want to?	no
2638	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah, as I said, it's just a question of,	no
2639	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	uh, do you wanna have to track down root	no
2640	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	if you have to make any change.	no
2641	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	But it doesn't have to be root. It could be some other user that we all can S_U_X  to.	no
2642	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	That's true.	no
2643	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	You have security issues with that.	no
2644	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So.	no
2645	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah, that's true.	no
2646	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I mean -	no
2647	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	That's what we do with doctor-speech though, right?	no
2648	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	No, with doctor-speech, it's just a group.	no
2649	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So - there're lots of different owners of i- i- of the files, but the group is always doctor-speech.	no
2650	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Or real, usually.	no
2651	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	But there is a  user  doctor-speech.	no
2652	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right?	no
2653	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I mean, I - I S_U_X to doctor-speech w- when I need to make a -	no
2654	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Nnn-	no
2655	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Oh,  do  you?	no
2656	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Oh. So tha-	no
2657	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	that's what I meant, it - just some	no
2658	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	a directory on, uh, one of the -	no
2659	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	"user like ""meeting-root"" or something."	no
2660	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Oh, O_K.	no
2661	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I don't know.	no
2662	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I mean, I'm not  too  worried, because the group's pretty small.	no
2663	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	But -	no
2664	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2665	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Also it seems like once it's been stored that night, it's - it's possible to recover from backups,	no
2666	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	so that the main risk is avoiding it being accidentally deleted during the day that it was recorded.	no
2667	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well, and just - You, then, also just have the general problem of permission on the other files,	no
2668	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	that, do you want people checking out a transcript file	no
2669	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	when they find an error,	no
2670	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	and  correcting  it, or do they wa- do you want it to go through  you?	no
2671	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2672	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2673	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And I'd prefer it to go through me.	no
2674	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	"O_K,   but that means that you're gonna have to be  available  for people,  all  the time, who say ""there's an error here"","	no
2675	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	rather than just - them just going in and correcting it.	no
2676	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well I p- At  this  point -  Yeah.	no
2677	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well, with C_V_S, though, you don't actually have to  do  it that way.	no
2678	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2679	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well, but -	no
2680	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	You have a  choice.  Either you  let  people do it themselves, or you don't.	no
2681	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2682	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	What I'm saying is that it can  be  the case that people can do it themselves  and  it can be reviewed.	no
2683	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	w- w-	no
2684	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well-	no
2685	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right?	no
2686	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right.	no
2687	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I mean, it's not like it's one or the other. We can do both.	no
2688	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah, you can -	no
2689	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right, so you could get email.	no
2690	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Send email to Jane that someone has done a	no
2691	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right.	no
2692	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I - I wanna  also  say that, you know, this is a -	no
2693	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	revision.	no
2694	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	uh, uh, My - my  view  on this is that once it's in a final  version  and I'm working  toward  all these being final  versions,	no
2695	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	then	no
2696	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	it can go into this next ro- this next realm. But it - it's sort of counter-productive to have	no
2697	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	changes  made which I would be  making  if I'd just gotten that far in the  file.  You know, it's - it's, um.	no
2698	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well, so, you don't have to  release  it	no
2699	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	to the  world  until you're  ready  to.	no
2700	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2701	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	That's  right.	no
2702	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So the question is s- w-	no
2703	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And then after  that,  then this would probably work.	no
2704	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2705	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So you would keep it in a separate file structure until you were ready to put it in the repository.	no
2706	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Good, good.	no
2707	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I mean -	no
2708	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Or just keep the lock on it.	no
2709	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Is C_V_S, like - Yeah, just keep the  lock  on.	no
2710	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I mean, just check it out - check it out and don't let anyone check it out -	no
2711	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Until you're - Yep.	no
2712	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	No, it does not - the  C_V_S   doesn't work that way.	no
2713	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Oh, it -	no
2714	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Oh, it doesn't. Oh, O_K.	no
2715	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	There's no - there's no lock when you check something out, not like R_C_S.	no
2716	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	In other words,  everybody  can check out  anything.	no
2717	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Oh.	no
2718	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	"The C_ stands for ""concurrent""."	no
2719	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So why not use R_C_S at that point? Just at that stage?	no
2720	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Cuz it's not remote.	no
2721	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	It's not remote.	no
2722	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	The nice thing about C_V_S is - is, you can be on a different machine.	no
2723	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	But at that point -	no
2724	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	we only  want,  probably, Jane to be in control  anyway,  and she - I mean, it's just an i-	no
2725	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	No, because U_W	no
2726	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	wants to have access to these  files.  That's the whole  point.	no
2727	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	But not to  modify  them, right? Just to  read  them.	no
2728	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	"Well, if they k- en- if they record a meeting, and they create a ""key"" file, and they find an error in their ""key"" file,"	no
2729	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	they shouldn't have to tell  us  about that	no
2730	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	so that they can create -	no
2731	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	correct an error in one of  their   files.	no
2732	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	"Well, the "" key "" file is -"	no
2733	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So that's why I wanna do it -	no
2734	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I don't  know,  uh - I mean -	no
2735	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	"ke- "" key "" file's different."	no
2736	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	"""Key"" fi-"	no
2737	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Different than  what?	no
2738	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	"Well, ""key"" file has the extra attributes that if you notice that there are lots of spikes on channel so-and-so, it's useful as a repository for putting that there."	no
2739	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	"And also if you notice that  there was an extra speaker, and didn't get mentioned in the ""key"" file, but they were only there for a second, but it's t- useful to mention that they were there."	no
2740	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	"So I th- I think that the ""key"" file is usefu- for notations related to the meeting,"	no
2741	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well -	no
2742	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	B-	no
2743	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	But, I mean, the meetings are gonna be the same  way.  So U_W records a meeting, we transcribe it.	no
2744	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	but it's  different  from the  transcript.	no
2745	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2746	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	"A few months later they listen to it and they say ""Ope!  They got that acronym wrong."""	no
2747	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2748	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Why - why sh-	no
2749	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Then they should send that through - Well -	no
2750	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	It's sort of not really a question about  permissions,  but more of  procedure.   Either  those  all  go through  Jane,  or through  someone,	no
2751	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
2752	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	or they  all   don't.  But it's sort of -	no
2753	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And if they all  do,  then there isn't a  problem,  right? Cuz once they give us the data, it's	no
2754	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	ours,  and if they wanna make changes - I mean, ours to sort of	no
2755	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	transcribe and annotate.	no
2756	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And if they wanna make  changes,  they can   do  that.	no
2757	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	The - the p- the  point  here is that it would be  nice  t- for there to be  one  repository.	no
2758	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2759	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah	no
2760	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And if  we  don't  let  them modify their own  data,	no
2761	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	they're not gonna  store  their data in our  repository.	no
2762	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Or if we make it  inconvenient  for them to change their data.	no
2763	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So then if they do have acc-	no
2764	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I - I'm just looking at it the other way  around.	no
2765	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	O_K, so what if they have -	no
2766	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	What if they have  accounts  here,	no
2767	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So - so let's say we k-	no
2768	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	and they use R_C_S,	no
2769	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	at that point, where you can l- really lock a file.	no
2770	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I mean, I'm worried. If you can't lock a  file,  this - this to me sounds very  scary.	no
2771	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Hmm.	no
2772	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Um -	no
2773	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And if they have accounts here and they're  modifying  it - If they're ac-	no
2774	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	if they're so closely linked that they're actually	no
2775	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	"modifying  transcripts and ""key"" files,"	no
2776	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	then they  could  do it	no
2777	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	by, you know, secure-shelling into ICSI,	no
2778	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	under R_C_S, at that point.	no
2779	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Ye- well, I don't see a real difference between R_C_S and any  other  system.	no
2780	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I mean, it's just mechanisms. The nice thing about C_V_S is that	no
2781	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	you can have multiple people modifying and if the changes don't  overlap  each other,	no
2782	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	they can just  do  it.	no
2783	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Hmm.	no
2784	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	That's interesting.	no
2785	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So the problem with  R_C_S  is that if two people	no
2786	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2787	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	want to modify a file at the same  time  they  can't,	no
2788	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	because the granularity of locking is at the file level.	no
2789	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	What- what does C_V_S do if they - if they  do  overlap?	no
2790	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Uh, there're lots of different policies for dealing with it. So -	no
2791	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
2792	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	But typically a person has to,	no
2793	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2794	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	uh, mediate	no
2795	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Oh.	no
2796	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	you know, which changes actually get - go through.	no
2797	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah, to decide which one is - Yeah.	no
2798	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Oh.	no
2799	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Oh, I-	no
2800	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So, maybe there  is  a way in C_V_S to  effectively	no
2801	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	lock  something if you  don't  want people to make any changes?	no
2802	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	"At the  repository  level, there  certainly  is. You can mark a file as - as ""you can't check this out""."	no
2803	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Uh-huh.	no
2804	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Oh. So -	no
2805	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	C_V_S is pretty good.	no
2806	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So then you could use C_V_S	no
2807	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	and, you know, just f- have remote access, but then it's up to whoever	no
2808	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	O_K.	no
2809	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yep.	no
2810	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	is, sort of,  responsible  for that level of  transcription  to decide	no
2811	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	how  and  when  to put these locks, or -	no
2812	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well, it's - it's just like source code, right?	no
2813	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So that, when you're developing it and it's really  rough,  you don't put it in the  repository.	no
2814	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2815	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	You wait to the point when you're ready to  release  it, and then you put it in the  repository  and if other people wanna -	no
2816	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah, so the w-	no
2817	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
2818	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	In-	no
2819	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	The - Maybe the model - It's a little bit different in C_V_S. When you check something out, you actually create your own directory with copies of everything in it, and that's what you  work  on.	no
2820	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Copy.	no
2821	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So, until you're ready to check it in,	no
2822	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	nobody sees anything you've done. And then when you check it in, it puts, sort of, you know - every change that you've done is - goes into the central -	no
2823	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right.	no
2824	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So if that's at an-	no
2825	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Hmm.	no
2826	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I guess it depends on Jane's - Uh, you know, if that's - if that model  works  for the  transcripts,  then	no
2827	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	that's  fine.  But if that pr-	no
2828	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	@@	no
2829	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	um, allows	no
2830	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	someone to come in and modify while  you're  modifying, and they turn out to be changes that,	no
2831	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	you know, would have been better to  wait  until your  version  came out, then	no
2832	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	that's really up to  you,  not up to the  software,  so.	no
2833	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well,	no
2834	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I also think, um, that the type of change ch- ch- varies an- I think it's a very good point. Because what if	no
2835	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	the - uh, what if  one  set of changes  one  person was making was	no
2836	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	with reference to some  typographical  convention.	no
2837	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
2838	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And the  other  person n- unkn- n-	no
2839	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	quite unknowingly, was changing it the other way  around.	no
2840	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Then you could end up with a  real   mess,  in terms of, like, consistency of conventions across a file, there  is  an argument to be made for having a single editor editing at that level.	no
2841	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well yeah, there would - there would have to be somebody to enforce the consistency. Yeah.	no
2842	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	But I like b- I like what Liz is saying about -	no
2843	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	That's right. And I also like - I l- also like Liz's uh, k- um,	no
2844	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	"phraseology of ""at this level of"" - I don't remember how you put it,  but this - ""at this level of transcription"" or whatever. I mean it's like there are different layers of whatever and different  types  of conventions,"	no
2845	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	and if it were an  acronym,  then I would - I think that it would make sense f- for them to	no
2846	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	have  input   into   that  level of things, but I wouldn't want them to be changing -	no
2847	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I'm just -	no
2848	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Imagine that we reverse this and  they  were keeping the repository and  we  were d- collecting meetings and  sending  them to them.	no
2849	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2850	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
2851	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	If I found an error,	no
2852	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	"and I sent them email and said ""here's this error"", and I didn't get a  response  for a couple weeks,"	no
2853	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I would stop sending them the - my data and I would start collecting it here and we would end up with two corpora.	no
2854	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well, yeah.	no
2855	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And I  don't  want that to  happen.  So we have to make it  convenient  for them to make changes that they wanna  make.	no
2856	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I agree.	no
2857	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well -	no
2858	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well, I see now, we're k- back into the same situation as when we were,	no
2859	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	uh, talking about a- allowing people to edit	no
2860	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	the transcripts before they  become public.	no
2861	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So there's a question of how easy or how hard to modify, and how that	no
2862	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
2863	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	impacts the amount of changing that's done.	no
2864	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And I - I think that it's, um,	no
2865	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I - I have received some suggestions for change, which I've  made.	no
2866	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And um, I think with an  acronym,  that's a clear case where it would be an  easy  change to incorporate.	no
2867	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	But it  would   worry  me to have people, um,	no
2868	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	having free reign to change these things, because of the need to have consistent conventions. And  people who	no
2869	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	are only just  visiting  the data might not have a sense of the larger system.	no
2870	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah, that's what  I  would be worried about  too.	no
2871	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well, I think - yeah, I think there are probably ways that you can say that, you know, only certain users are allowed to change	no
2872	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2873	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	things.	no
2874	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
2875	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Uh, so we can probably restrict it to be -	no
2876	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	You know, f-  casual  users who are just  browsing  can just r- get it read-only, can't check in to the archive.	no
2877	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
2878	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	"Whereas we could say ""other people"", you know, ""these people are allowed to actually submit changes""."	no
2879	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right.	no
2880	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I mean,	no
2881	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I - I think  one  thing that's probably everybody would  agree  on is that	no
2882	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	there will never be a point where	no
2883	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	you know, we can say that for  sure  there's no problems with any of the transcripts. I mean there's,	no
2884	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	uh - f- You know,  something's  going to get overlooked at some point, or somebody's gonna wanna make a change  somehow.  So we need to	no
2885	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	have  some  mechanism for,	no
2886	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	um, handling changes in the  future.	no
2887	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I agr- I agree but I have to also add  one   other  thing which i- before I forget it,  which is	no
2888	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Adam's  point about when you were reviewing the I_B_M transcripts.	no
2889	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	u- This was mentioned at the beginning of the meeting.	no
2890	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	You said that there were  some  places where  it  wasn't  what y- was written  already,  but you could  see  how they might have thought that's what it  said.	no
2891	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So there - it's  not  just a right and  wrong  thing.  Sometimes  there tru- there are  absolutely  stretches where there  is  no - no - k- if you were at the meeting and you could  ask  the person,	no
2892	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah. Exactly.	no
2893	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
2894	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	maybe,  m- you know, they could - they could've  told  you, but five minutes  later  they might not have been able to tell you,	no
2895	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right.	no
2896	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	even if they were  listening  to it.	no
2897	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	So, sometimes it isn't right and wrong, sometimes it's multiple interpretations, and -	no
2898	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2899	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Good point. Yeah.	no
2900	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Now - But of course, this  does  raise the  possibility  of  allowing,	no
2901	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	um, an extra annotation for, you know, alternative interpretations of a stretch.	no
2902	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
2903	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	But I just wanted to say it isn't simply right or wrong.	no
2904	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah, that's a good point.	no
2905	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Or overlooked or not overlooked.	no
2906	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Sometimes they're truly ambiguous, and	no
2907	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
2908	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	um, uh, um, nice to have a  notation  for that, but. Yeah.	no
2909	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Gotta go.	no
2910	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2911	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I mean, I like that idea because even a casual user can always send  email	no
2912	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
2913	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	to whoever's in charge, and say,	no
2914	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	"you know, ""we'd like these changes"" and,"	no
2915	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Well -	no
2916	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	you know, hopefully we'll give them a response. And if they really do it a  lot,  and they say	no
2917	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I just - I don't s-	no
2918	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I don't see that this is e-	no
2919	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yep.	no
2920	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	"""we're a casual user but we want a chance to change the  transcripts "" then we can"	no
2921	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	face that if it  happens,  but	no
2922	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	"Can you write ""unread"" on that?"	no
2923	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah, thank you.	no
2924	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I don't really see the people at U_W that I  know  of right  now  making huge amoun- investing huge amounts of time in changing transcripts. But I could be wrong.	no
2925	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Probably not  transcripts,  but it would be nice to have  one  mechanism for  all  the files.	no
2926	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And they're  certainly  gonna wanna change  tools.	no
2927	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2928	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And so - you know, it's the same as source code. You - you release source code at some point.	no
2929	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And, either  you  have to do everything or you  share  responsibility.	no
2930	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah I mean a lot of the open source pro-	no
2931	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	projects face this same problem.	no
2932	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right.	no
2933	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	You know, p-  anybody  can check out the code,	no
2934	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	but  not  everybody can check it in.  Yeah.	no
2935	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right.  And  there's some happy medium and we don't know what that  is  yet	no
2936	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	until we get feedback from people, but	no
2937	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	what  if  it's O_K to just handle it	no
2938	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	with	no
2939	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	sort of a  person  in  charge  of the  philosophy  behind the changes,	no
2940	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	and some people with permissions,	no
2941	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	maybe by  request,  to make changes, That we don't just give people permissions if they're not gonna make changes. Because  I've  overwritten a -	no
2942	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	a file by  mistake,  not  wanting  to have done that cuz I didn't think I had permission, when I  did.	no
2943	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
2944	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Um, and then just	no
2945	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
2946	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	seeing if that is enough to -	no
2947	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	to handle the transcript changes.	no
2948	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I'm just worried about	no
2949	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	letting everybody go in and make  changes,  cuz it's real easy when you're	no
2950	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	trying to, I don't know, run alignments and there's a word you wanna fix, to go in and do that and then mess up  other  things,	no
2951	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	if you don't know,	no
2952	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	you know, the overall philosophy behind the - the conventions.	no
2953	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
2954	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right.	no
2955	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And als- it also-  Mm-hmm.	no
2956	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Then - There is also the possibility - Remember, in C_V_S, when we talk about making changes,	no
2957	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	You can back everything out.	no
2958	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	there's sort of two types that can be made.  To your  local,	no
2959	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	or to the  global.	no
2960	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
2961	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And so people can make  changes  to their  local  and if they screw those up,	no
2962	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right.	no
2963	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Exactly.	no
2964	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	that's, you know, in their - that's only on them. It's w- it's the checking  in  part that r- we really care about, and	no
2965	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
2966	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	that  we can control with, you know, who can check things in and stuff. So we can - I think we can  do  this.	no
2967	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Or just, yeah, start by make it a really tight control and then as people really need the control you can	no
2968	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
2969	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
2970	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah. They can still check it out -	no
2971	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	ascertain whether or not to -	no
2972	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah, cuz they can still check out full copies and make whatever changes they want to their local copies.	no
2973	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right.	no
2974	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And it won't affect the - the g- the global, official, ones at all.	no
2975	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right.	no
2976	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right, but what I want to  avoid  is ending up with two corpora.	no
2977	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yeah.	no
2978	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yes.	no
2979	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And so if you make it too hard for them to check back in, they'll check it out once,	no
2980	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Definitely.	no
2981	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Yep.	no
2982	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	they'll make all the changes, they'll never tell  us  about the changes,	no
2983	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
2984	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	and we'll get two different corpora.	no
2985	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Mm-hmm.	no
2986	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Right?	no
2987	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	I think we're  already  gonna - I mean there's already	no
2988	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	some  chance that different annotations, different	no
2989	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	places, you know -	no
2990	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	But you can	no
2991	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	control  that by  knowing  you're making two corpora or  knowing  that you're adding	no
2992	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	um, annotations on one version and you don't have the latest corrections maybe at that  point.  And then you finish the project and you realize that there were	no
2993	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	corrections  made on your  originals  and then	no
2994	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	you have to  merge  them.	no
2995	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	And the b-	no
2996	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	the  thing  that makes it ea- O_K to  do  that, is	no
2997	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	knowing where the synch time boundaries are.	no
2998	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	Cuz you can automatically pretty much  merge  things if you've only got twenty words or so in an utterance. It's when you get the whole  meeting	no
2999	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	and the  synch  times ch-	no
3000	transcript	transcript_Bmr022	have changed, or you can't correspond to a previous version with synch times, that you get in trouble.	no

3057	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K.	no
3058	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K.   So the one -	no
3059	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	one thing I knew I wanted to talk about was about, uh,	no
3060	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	sort of last minute stuff to- to, uh, try to get some recognition results.	no
3061	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Recognition results  for -	no
3062	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3063	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So, uh, on - on - on meeting data.	no
3064	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	And so, I'm - I'm not sure exactly what you're doing already, and - and there's some stuff I've talked to Dave -	no
3065	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Well, we- I just started recognition on the	no
3066	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	on Thilo's  segments,	no
3067	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	which was - but using the far- far-	no
3068	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	the  close-talking  microphone.	no
3069	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K. So -	no
3070	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Um -	no
3071	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	And you wanted - I know you wanted the far-field  data.	no
3072	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right. So - so, we have  some  stuff with no overlap, uh, for which there would be	no
3073	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	near - near-field results.	no
3074	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Uh-huh.	no
3075	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	We wanted to get the far-field results for that.	no
3076	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	And then this - this real, uh, long shot thing would be, that we'd apply Dave's processing	no
3077	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	to, uh, potentially training  and  test data	no
3078	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
3079	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	and do the - look at the same thing. And	no
3080	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	in talking this morning with, uh, Chuck and with Dave	no
3081	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	one thought was to use - We couldn't remember how	no
3082	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	different the numbers were, but if you just  worked with males only and used the short training	no
3083	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	there're - there're - uh, I think Chuck's recollection was that when he was doing the feature stuff, it took maybe a day and a half	no
3084	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	to do the training. Yeah.	no
3085	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	To retrain?	no
3086	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Uh	no
3087	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3088	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Um.	no
3089	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	That's about right.	no
3090	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Actually, it should probably be -	no
3091	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	It depends on who else is using machines, but we have more machines now. So.	no
3092	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	That's true.	no
3093	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	It's more like a day, probably.	no
3094	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Um, how much worse is the short training set than the large one, in terms of the ultimate performance?	no
3095	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mmm, it's like -	no
3096	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Something like three - three percent -	no
3097	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	three or four percent absolute.	no
3098	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yep.	no
3099	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So, it's - that should be fine for this, I would think.	no
3100	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So we - an- and you have the short - you have short training results for	no
3101	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	the close  case?	no
3102	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Um, not for meetings.	no
3103	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Because we didn't train -	no
3104	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	we didn't re- ever recognize with the -	no
3105	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	with the	no
3106	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	small models  on meeting data.	no
3107	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	But I - I have the models, so I could	no
3108	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So, how do you know it's - ? Oh, it's three percent on - on, uh, on Hub-five.	no
3109	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	run reco-	no
3110	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	On -	no
3111	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Hub-five.	no
3112	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I see.	no
3113	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah. But we have the models so we could get that number, and -	no
3114	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So the question is, what - ?	no
3115	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I mean, the - the - mmm-	no
3116	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	w-	no
3117	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	The recognition also takes  non-negligible amount of time. So -	no
3118	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	we might wanna restrict it to, maybe, a few meetings,	no
3119	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	if you want to do a full comparison.	no
3120	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	It has to be enough so that -	no
3121	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Uh.	no
3122	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I mean, it's the non-overlap only.	no
3123	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Um -	no
3124	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	And -	no
3125	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	it has to be enough to be  sort  of comparable to what	no
3126	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	you folks were seeing and what you reported already.	no
3127	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Hmm.	no
3128	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I mean -	no
3129	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Well, do we have the - do we have the processed data? That - that's also -	no
3130	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	No. He has to create that.	no
3131	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
3132	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	But - but - s- but - so -	no
3133	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Um -	no
3134	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	We have  a whole parallel set of things over here	no
3135	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mmm.	no
3136	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	which are all with digits.	no
3137	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I see.	no
3138	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	And - and - and Dave has been working with that and there's all of those issues.	no
3139	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	But -	no
3140	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I know that if I  go in with something that's not just digits it would be  good.	no
3141	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	And, um, so -	no
3142	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	We already have these results that you - I mean, on -	no
3143	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	uh, a l- a lot- tha- tha-	no
3144	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	a particular test set, that you - that we reported at H_L_T.	no
3145	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Hmm.	no
3146	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
3147	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Um, it'd be nice to have something  more  than that. And w- we had talked about was having distant -	no
3148	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Um, and then,	no
3149	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	uh, if we could on top of that - I mean, so this is gonna be a lot worse. Right?	no
3150	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Whatever comparison we - w- w- one would presume. But we don't know how  much  worse,	no
3151	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
3152	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
3153	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	w- w- uh, which is certainly one interesting thing.	no
3154	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	And then, um,	no
3155	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Dave - I think we figured that it'd probably take a day or two to compute the -	no
3156	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	the, uh -	no
3157	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	uh -	no
3158	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Well -	no
3159	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	How many hours of training - ?	no
3160	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Actually, I did retrain -	no
3161	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I recently retrained,	no
3162	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	um,	no
3163	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	for another reason, on the full training set.	no
3164	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	And that took only -	no
3165	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I think it took only two days.	no
3166	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3167	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So, it's actually conceivable	no
3168	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	to do - use the full training set.	no
3169	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah, but we also have to do this other processing, so having a smaller training set, if it's only a few percent difference, it might be -	no
3170	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Oh, I see.	no
3171	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	be worth doing it.	no
3172	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	But- m-	no
3173	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	How big is the small  training  set?	no
3174	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Do you remember?	no
3175	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Hmm.	no
3176	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Uh.  Whew.	no
3177	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Hhh.	no
3178	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I don't know, something -	no
3179	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	something like -	no
3180	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	something  between	no
3181	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	thirty and fifty hours, maybe. I f- I forget the	no
3182	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	It's around there.	no
3183	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	exac- Right.	no
3184	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	And ha- and - and male is roughly half of that, or - ?	no
3185	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Or - or - or was that only male?	no
3186	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Well, that's only male.	no
3187	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Uh. Actually, I don't know.  I'd -	no
3188	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I - I can look it up.	no
3189	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	It's - it's - it's just, uh, I don't know the - remember the - the number.	no
3190	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	We could only jus- just do the male only right? Or	no
3191	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K.	no
3192	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Well, the males  account for most of this meeting data anyhow. So -	no
3193	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	will we run into trouble when we g- ?	no
3194	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3195	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah. I would say we - you do only males.	no
3196	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3197	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So -	no
3198	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah. So that's certainly part of the issue, is that right now he's - he hasn't written his stuff for efficiency.	no
3199	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah. It's - it's in Matlab and so on, and -	no
3200	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
3201	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	And, uh, it's not an  impossible  amount of time. We - we were	no
3202	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	guesstimating it was like one and a half times faster than real time, or something?	no
3203	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So, if there's thirty hours of data, you can calculate	no
3204	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	u-	no
3205	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	that he can do, uh, the enhancement in	no
3206	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	a day	no
3207	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	and something. So -	no
3208	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Hmm.	no
3209	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	But	no
3210	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	if  we were dealing with two hundred hours or something, I think it'd be  prohibitive.	no
3211	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	No. It's definitely -	no
3212	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	It's less than a hundred hours, for sure. It's -	no
3213	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3214	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	It's probably actually, uh -	no
3215	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	It's - uh, I think it's around thirty hours	no
3216	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	just for -	no
3217	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	That's what I was thinking. Yeah.	no
3218	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3219	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	for one gender. Yeah.	no
3220	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah. So, I mean, it's a bit of a push, but it seems like,	no
3221	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K, we've got some models, we've got some training data, we have software that works, he's got	no
3222	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	a method that helps with, you know, other ta- another task.	no
3223	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Um -	no
3224	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	It, you know,  appears  to be, you know, debugged.	no
3225	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	S-	no
3226	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
3227	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Um -	no
3228	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So - We- Yo- So, one thing I was wondering is,	no
3229	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	did you already do that middle one or should	no
3230	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	we re-do that one, too?	no
3231	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	No. I didn't do that, because we haven't even	no
3232	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	You didn't do that. O_K.	no
3233	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	cut the waveforms for that. So -	no
3234	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah. That's what I was gonna say next. We hafta  cut the, uh -	no
3235	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right. So.	no
3236	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	W- s- so is - Morgan, is the plan to just pick one of the far-field mikes? Uh -	no
3237	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3238	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	And there's a bit of a question whether you want to use -	no
3239	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yes.	no
3240	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	um, what segmentations you want to use.	no
3241	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Uh -	no
3242	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Uh, David just -	no
3243	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Um, I'm sorry.	no
3244	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Don  just, uh, created	no
3245	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	a new	no
3246	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	version of the first meetings that we had previously recognized, but with different segmentation. And so -	no
3247	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Um -	no
3248	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	It would be  nice  -	no
3249	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I mean, if the results are  comparable   to what we had before -	no
3250	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	to use those segmentations, because	no
3251	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	th- then we could claim that everything's automatic.	no
3252	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Do you know  when he'll have the - the comparison?	no
3253	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
3254	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Well, I'm - as I said, I just started  the recognizer,	no
3255	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	um -	no
3256	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	It will -	no
3257	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	uh,  it will probably be  a couple hours before -	no
3258	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	before I have some results. So -	no
3259	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Oh. Well, that's not bad.	no
3260	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Oh, O_K. So - cuz I don't think the new data	no
3261	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	will be ready, uh,	no
3262	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	for a couple days may- probably.	no
3263	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	You mean the training.	no
3264	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So, the training.	no
3265	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	But the segmentations matter for the	no
3266	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3267	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	filtering. Right? Because -	no
3268	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	For the  test.	no
3269	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	For the test set. Yeah. So,	no
3270	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah, fo-	no
3271	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3272	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	need to be -	no
3273	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	But, first - first,	no
3274	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	of course, you would wanna process the  training data, because we wanna get that started. Yeah.	no
3275	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
3276	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3277	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I mean, it - it'd be really  great  if it was all automatic, but I think that, you know, given the pressure of time, if -	no
3278	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	i- i-	no
3279	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I mean, since you're gonna find out in a short amount of time, that's great.	no
3280	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
3281	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	But i- if - if it doesn't work out, I think we would rather charge ahead with the older	no
3282	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
3283	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	segmentations and -	no
3284	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
3285	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Um, and we were gonna use one of the P_Z_Ms.	no
3286	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I don- I don't know what -	no
3287	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Probably whatever one you've been using for - for - for the digits. Is it this one?	no
3288	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I think it's that one. Right?	no
3289	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	It's e- F_.	no
3290	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	F_.	no
3291	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah, that's it.	no
3292	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I - I'd - which - ? That's F_? How do you know?	no
3293	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	That's F_.	no
3294	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	It's the second nearest the machine room.	no
3295	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Oh.	no
3296	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Bien sur    O_K.	no
3297	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Alright, so -	no
3298	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Bet they'll have fun with that one.	no
3299	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K, so.	no
3300	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Uh -	no
3301	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K. So, uh, I just want to make sure I understand what we need to run.	no
3302	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Um -	no
3303	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Let's see. So, it's - O_K, so if we're talking about - Let's - let's assume that we're gonna use the new segmentations.	no
3304	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	We need to,	no
3305	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	um,	no
3306	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	run recognition o- just looking at the no overlap column.	no
3307	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Basically, we have to d- r- do recognitions for all three of those cases. Right?	no
3308	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
3309	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
3310	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Um, because  we're gonna be using the - just the male,	no
3311	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	uh, model - short training set for the male. So we need to have results for all three of those, even though we have -	no
3312	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
3313	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Ma- maybe you should limit ourselves to the Meeting Recorder	no
3314	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	meetings?	no
3315	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K.	no
3316	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Um,	no
3317	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	if you were gonna cut down on the test set, I would suggest that.	no
3318	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Well -	no
3319	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Maybe. But, I - I mean, how long does it take	no
3320	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Actually, the longer - the Robustness meetings take longer, because there's this one speaker who talks a lot.	no
3321	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	for the test?	no
3322	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	And so	no
3323	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	the -	no
3324	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Um. No. It's because for all the -	no
3325	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	for the adaptation and normalization steps, you cannot -	no
3326	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	you have to d- you have to, uh, um,	no
3327	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	you cannot chop it up into small pieces.	no
3328	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So, you're sort of limited by how long the longest speaker,	no
3329	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	uh,	no
3330	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	is s- speaking.	no
3331	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So how much data there is from the - the speaker who talks the most.	no
3332	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So,	no
3333	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	um, you parallelize across different  speakers,	no
3334	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
3335	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	but	no
3336	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	you know, if you have a bunch of speakers who speak very little and then one wh-	no
3337	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
3338	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	who - who speaks a lot, then	no
3339	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	effectively, everybody waits for the longest one to process. So.	no
3340	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
3341	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3342	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Bu-	no
3343	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	But what - what was your result for - uh, that we had at the H_L_T? Was that a combination of me?	no
3344	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	That was both types of meetings, but most - but there were only two Robustness meetings, and four or five,	no
3345	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	And if we're re-doing the baseline anyways, it - it - it would be O_K. Right? I mean -	no
3346	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	uh, Meeting Recorders.	no
3347	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
3348	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	To - to just limit ourselves to a smaller -	no
3349	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	How long would it take to run recognition, if we did that?	no
3350	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Oh.	no
3351	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Uh, I - I -	no
3352	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I don't have - I don't have a good  gue-	no
3353	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I mean, is - is it like a  day  or is it  a few  hours  or - roughly?	no
3354	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	For everything? For all the meetings?	no
3355	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	For - yeah, let's say we  just  did the Meeting Recorder meetings for our test set.	no
3356	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Uh.	no
3357	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Um.	no
3358	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	It's probably more than a day, but probably less than two.	no
3359	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Oh, really. I didn't realize each test took that long.	no
3360	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Well, i- No. I mean for all the meetings.	no
3361	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Because it's -	no
3362	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Again, it's, um -	no
3363	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So each meeting - each meetings takes,	no
3364	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So you were doing like -	no
3365	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	uh, something like -	no
3366	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Again, we - we - I ran - when we ran these,	no
3367	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	we were sort of short on machines, and, um,	no
3368	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mmm.	no
3369	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I don't know, I - I would estimate maybe four hours per meeting.	no
3370	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Something like that.	no
3371	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Four hours per meeting.	no
3372	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
3373	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Wow.	no
3374	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah. But if you -	no
3375	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So, if you do half a dozen meetings, that's - that's about a day. We also have more machines now.	no
3376	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
3377	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	well	no
3378	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right. So that's why I'm saying I'm not sure how they would scale with more machines.	no
3379	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3380	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3381	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I mean, if we had about six - A six hour test set's not bad. Right?	no
3382	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
3383	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	S- six hour test set.	no
3384	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Six meetings. O_K.	no
3385	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	You know?	no
3386	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right? I mean, a lot of the evaluations have been -	no
3387	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah. We did.	no
3388	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	We have M_R -	no
3389	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	two, th- We have two, three, four, fi- I think there are four Meeting Recorder meetings that we worked with.	no
3390	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Four that you worked with?	no
3391	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I think it's -	no
3392	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Is it the same set as  the alignments? I think it's  five  Meeting Recorder meetings.	no
3393	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3394	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Five?	no
3395	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K.	no
3396	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	That would be O_K, too. I mean, I'm -	no
3397	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	i- So, if they have a set that they worked with, and you - you got -	no
3398	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	@@	no
3399	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Did you	no
3400	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	do similarly in performance between them and the other meetings, or was it - ?	no
3401	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Uh, with the Robust- compared to Robustness?	no
3402	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3403	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	The big variation is by - whether it's a native speaker	no
3404	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3405	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	or not.	no
3406	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	And whether	no
3407	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	it's, um -	no
3408	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Uh, I think that's the o- actually - and - and of course what,	no
3409	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	um,	no
3410	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	you know, whether it's lapel or,	no
3411	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	uh, headset microphone.	no
3412	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	And overlap or not. Yeah.	no
3413	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3414	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So maybe just with the - the - the Meeting Recorder set of the -	no
3415	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	And we can exclude - we don't need to recognize the  non-natives, because we know that -	no
3416	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	De- th- that you did before.	no
3417	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I mean, in fact, we excluded them previously	no
3418	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah. So we want to do the same - same thing.	no
3419	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	from -	no
3420	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
3421	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K. So - Alright. So if we got a list	no
3422	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	of the,	no
3423	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	uh, segmentations for these five Meeting Recorder meetings, we could start,	no
3424	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	uh, the first two	no
3425	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	experiments   going right away, using the short male models.	no
3426	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
3427	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So, you could get those going while	no
3428	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Dave is, um, creating waveforms for the r- retraining the short male models.	no
3429	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3430	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Once we know which segmentations we're using. Yeah.	no
3431	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right. O_K. O_K. And then -	no
3432	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K. So, do we w- also want to run	no
3433	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	that bottom experiment without	no
3434	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	retraining the short male models on his thing? Did you want that?	no
3435	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Or - ?	no
3436	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Um,	no
3437	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I - I agree that that would be an interesting thing to do, but I sort of regard it as secondary.	no
3438	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K. So, we'll save that.	no
3439	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So if there's sort of machines sitting around and people sitting around and they're waiting for	no
3440	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	other things to finish, then sure. But -	no
3441	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Uh, Chuck had been asking about that earlier as kind of a control to know, um -	no
3442	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Cuz, I mean, you could imagine a fantasy in which you said that Dave's processing	no
3443	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	made the, uh, far microphone like the near microphone. In which case	no
3444	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
3445	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	you shouldn't have to actually retrain.	no
3446	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	But it's - it's not really true. It's - it's sort of fantasy. It does - it does muck up the data in - in some funny ways. And so,	no
3447	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
3448	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I'm - I'm kind of questioning that. But -	no
3449	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Well, i- it -	no
3450	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	But -	no
3451	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Well, on a more basic level, also, it means that	no
3452	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	that  third  experiment, there are actually  two  differences between the other experiments, not one.	no
3453	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
3454	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So, it's hard to know -	no
3455	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	It involves retraining and it involves a -	no
3456	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
3457	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Uh, that's right.	no
3458	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I mean the other thing which - which it might come in -	no
3459	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	to is if there was some  problem	no
3460	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	in the retraining.	no
3461	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I mean, maybe you'd just have some mechanical thing we do wrong.	no
3462	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
3463	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Uh, that, uh - since Dave's experience was that	no
3464	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
3465	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	it didn't help as  much  if you didn't retrain, but it does help some,	no
3466	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	that we would hopefully see that.	no
3467	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
3468	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So, that - that's - that's true.	no
3469	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Wait, did - ?	no
3470	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I- i-	no
3471	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So when you used	no
3472	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	original - the original models, and you just process	no
3473	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	the test set in this way, d- do you get any -	no
3474	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	u-	no
3475	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	do you get decent performance or not?	no
3476	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I - I - I think, um,	no
3477	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	for the far-mike H_T_K system I was using,	no
3478	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
3479	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	it did help somewhat. I could re-check that. But it was such a bad baseline	no
3480	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mmm.	no
3481	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	that	no
3482	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I don't know what that means.	no
3483	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
3484	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
3485	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K.	no
3486	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Cuz the baseline word error rate was around forty percent on digits.	no
3487	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
3488	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	On the far-field?	no
3489	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
3490	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
3491	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So -	no
3492	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K. Well, I'll - I can get started on the -	no
3493	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	well, the first -	no
3494	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	the one that already has a	no
3495	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	cross there. We need to re-do that with small models.	no
3496	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
3497	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3498	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	And then, have to ask, um,	no
3499	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I guess, Don	no
3500	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	to, uh, cut the,	no
3501	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	um,	no
3502	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	cut the segments for the sh-	no
3503	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	for the tis- distant mike.	no
3504	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Uh, uh - that's -	no
3505	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So we would be using the  same  channel	no
3506	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	for each - fo- for everything?	no
3507	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
3508	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3509	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K.	no
3510	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I mean, do you ha- do you have to rely on his segmentations at all to do the top one?	no
3511	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So.	no
3512	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	No, no. We would use the same segmentations, but he needs to extract -	no
3513	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	extract the wavef- form segments from a different channel.	no
3514	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Oh. O_K.	no
3515	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Got it.	no
3516	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
3517	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So when you said you were gonna start that top one, were you gonna use the new segmentations?	no
3518	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
3519	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Um -	no
3520	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3521	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K.	no
3522	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	If - assuming that	no
3523	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	the performance	no
3524	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	turns out to be  comparable   with -	no
3525	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	with the old experiments	no
3526	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right. O_K.	no
3527	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	and the old segmentations.	no
3528	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Now there's the issue of -	no
3529	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Oh, O_K. So there's the issue of speaker normalization. So,	no
3530	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	with the distant microphone you wouldn't know which speaker	no
3531	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	is talking.	no
3532	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right?	no
3533	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Can we - ?	no
3534	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	We - we talked about this before.	no
3535	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I think what we were saying was that, um,	no
3536	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	the very fact that in both cases we're ignoring the overlap section	no
3537	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	means that, um,	no
3538	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	uh,	no
3539	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	we're to some extent finessing that. So,	no
3540	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	um, I think,	no
3541	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	for the purposes of  just  determining whether a far-field microphone -	no
3542	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	uh, what the effect of the far-field microphone is, we should do the same to both.	no
3543	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
3544	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I see. So you want to cheat?	no
3545	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I mean -	no
3546	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	We want to i- incorporate	no
3547	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	certain data that would not be available during final tests,	no
3548	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	uh, under a - a full fair test of it, much as we are in the - all the numbers that we have so far.	no
3549	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K. So we assume - we assume knowledge of the speakers as -	no
3550	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Oops.	no
3551	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	as, um -	no
3552	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	in a way that's compatible with the close-talking	no
3553	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3554	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	test set. O_K.	no
3555	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	We - we simply wanna determine what's the difference in performance due to being distant versus close.	no
3556	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Oh, O_K.	no
3557	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So,	no
3558	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	does that mean you turn off speaker normalization when you run it? Or you just let it do what it would do, an- ?	no
3559	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	No. It means - No. It just means	no
3560	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	you - you group together	no
3561	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	the segments  that by magic you know belong	no
3562	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	to one speaker,	no
3563	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	and - and treat -	no
3564	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I mean to a lesser extent you had that same magic the other way, too, because	no
3565	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	you have leakage into other microphones. Right?	no
3566	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	But, it's just you're using the fact that	no
3567	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
3568	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	this is	no
3569	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	where this person is. Right?	no
3570	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
3571	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So.	no
3572	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	But, um -	no
3573	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	It's just easier to do.	no
3574	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Well, in the new test, actually, that's not true.	no
3575	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So -	no
3576	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Again, if this - if these new segmentations work O_K,	no
3577	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3578	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	then we - then it's a fair -	no
3579	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	it's a completely fair  test.	no
3580	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So, how do you determine what you use to group together to be a - a - ?	no
3581	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	You group together all the data coming in through one channel	no
3582	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	and where  Thilo's speech detector has -	no
3583	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	has determined that there is speech.	no
3584	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	And that speech is - is deemed to  come  from that speaker, whether that's true or not.	no
3585	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So if you get some cross-talk from another microphone, then you just	no
3586	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	process this - it as if it were from that speaker.	no
3587	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	The only other alternative would be to turn off speaker adaptation in both.	no
3588	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Well, that's more of a problem.	no
3589	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I mean, because it's - You can just pretend it's some kind of	no
3590	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	gene- I mean you can  pretend  it's all from one speaker and do all this processing the same,	no
3591	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	but then you're gonna get results that are worse on account of not doing proper	no
3592	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
3593	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	speaker normalization and you're gonna have -	no
3594	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So, you could certainly do  better  than that by doing, for instance - uh, cluster the segments,	no
3595	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	which is what we do, say, in a Broadcast News system, where you don't  have  speaker labels.	no
3596	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	But that would be another processing step that	no
3597	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I'm - I would have to  debug first, and so forth, and so we wanna  avoid  that.	no
3598	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Hmm.	no
3599	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So I agree with you. We should -	no
3600	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	we should, uh, do the -	no
3601	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	you know, this sort of cheating experiment.	no
3602	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K.	no
3603	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah. An- and e- so that will tell us  what the difference it between the mikes, and then, uh, in order to -	no
3604	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	The - the other	no
3605	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	difference that we'd have to take care of is that, uh - yeah, we - we don't have  a  mike that, uh,	no
3606	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	is particular to a  person.  And so we'll have to do some clustering, and that'll be another -	no
3607	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	another, uh, issue, too.	no
3608	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
3609	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	But, it - it - I could be wrong, but it seems to me that - that	no
3610	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	the speaker - the -	no
3611	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	the level of degradation that you get	no
3612	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	from	no
3613	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	having the distant mike in a normal acoustic	no
3614	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Hmm.	no
3615	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	is much greater than what you get from, say, not applying speaker adaptation or applying speaker adaptation.	no
3616	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I think that the -	no
3617	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I mean, we'll see. But - but, I think that the kind of gains that we've seen from speaker adaptation	no
3618	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	on Hub-five sort of things are like a few percent. Right? And -	no
3619	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	It's not just speaker adaptation. It's the whole	no
3620	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	norm- feature normalization process. I- it's spea- uh, all that is speaker-based.	no
3621	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	You know, so we -	no
3622	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So, in  that  I'm,	no
3623	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	um -	no
3624	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Y- you know, d- d- b- the most important, of course, is the  cepstral mean subtraction.	no
3625	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	And that -	no
3626	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3627	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I don't know if we - we never really - I don't remember,	no
3628	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	because it's so far -	no
3629	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	s- so long ago that we didn't do that on a per speaker basis, but -	no
3630	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	It doesn't make that much difference, I think. I would doubt that it would be a huge amount of difference for that.	no
3631	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So, I mean, I - I think that  that  difference would definitely be marginal.	no
3632	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I think the  main  thing is to do  something  - to do some cepstral mean subtraction on some level.	no
3633	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	And, uh, so what's different about this processing is just that we're doing it	no
3634	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	at a much longer time  scale. Right?	no
3635	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Hmm.	no
3636	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mmm.	no
3637	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	But -	no
3638	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Um -	no
3639	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	A- and by the way,	no
3640	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	What wo-	no
3641	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	it's - actually we're -	no
3642	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	we're already - If we use the same segmentations that we use for the close-talking microphone, then	no
3643	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	the segmentations  assume  that we have access to all channels and	no
3644	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	cross	no
3645	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	That's right.	no
3646	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	correlate them, so	no
3647	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	there's no  point  in not using that knowledge for speaker identification.	no
3648	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3649	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
3650	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Uh, I- I think also for the log spectral mean subtraction,	no
3651	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3652	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	uh, we wanna know which speaker's talking when, cuz we wanna	no
3653	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	chain together the audio from one particular speaker to calculate the mean and subtract it, and we don't -	no
3654	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3655	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
3656	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
3657	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K.	no
3658	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Um. Yeah, I guess.	no
3659	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	But, um,	no
3660	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I also think that a- again once we got into it, that, um, using some kind of clustering would probably	no
3661	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	work reasonably well there, too.	no
3662	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Certainly for the - the two microphone case, which we're not gonna mess with because it's another whole	no
3663	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	deal with the low-quality microphones, um,	no
3664	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	we ought to be able to at least tell	no
3665	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	that it  appears  that things are coming from a particular direction.	no
3666	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Hmm.	no
3667	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So we ought to be able to use  that  information,	no
3668	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	um, as well.	no
3669	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	But, I think we might	no
3670	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	be able to do not too bad a job of	no
3671	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	separating out	no
3672	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	sp-	no
3673	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	uh, segments that appear to come from a single speaker	no
3674	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	both in terms of s- acoustic similarity and in terms of direction.	no
3675	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So, I mean - But that's another research thing to do and  probably won't get done the next week.	no
3676	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right. So what - what is the schedule here?	no
3677	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Well, I mean, I'm - I'm leaving for  for the, uh,	no
3678	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	the New Orleans meeting, uh, next  Saturday,  and -	no
3679	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
3680	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	and, um,  it'd be kinda nice to have	no
3681	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	some results at least a day or two before that, so that I could	no
3682	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
3683	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	figure out what I wanted to say about it.	no
3684	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Oh, we'll call you when you get there.	no
3685	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	You'll have email. Right?	no
3686	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3687	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Uh, not to mention that - that, uh, Mari's putting together this report	no
3688	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mmm.	no
3689	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	next week, too, you know. So -	no
3690	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Uh,	no
3691	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	what we were  hoping  was that over the weekend we could do, uh, the, um, calculation on the training set	no
3692	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mmm.	no
3693	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	and, uh -	no
3694	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	uh, maybe, you know, we could -	no
3695	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	by the end of the weekend, we could have the top one, and - and then	no
3696	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	early next week, do these.	no
3697	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mmm.	no
3698	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	If we had enough machines, maybe do  them   in parallel.	no
3699	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
3700	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So that by the middle of the week we had s- had some kind of result.	no
3701	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I mean, it's - it's one of these  Hail Mary kinds of things. I mean, it -	no
3702	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	it, uh -	no
3703	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mmm.	no
3704	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	might - might not  work out.	no
3705	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	But, uh, f- figured I may as well ask for it.	no
3706	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K.	no
3707	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I'll ask -	no
3708	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So - ?	no
3709	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	The other thing is, um -	no
3710	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	and I'll ask Don which is easier to process in terms of creating these -	no
3711	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	the - the test data for the far -	no
3712	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	far microphone.	no
3713	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	If - if it turns out that for some reason it's easier for him to	no
3714	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	use the old - um,	no
3715	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	the - the - the old, uh,  segmentations,	no
3716	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Segmentation?	no
3717	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	then we'll just use that, I figure.	no
3718	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
3719	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Um -	no
3720	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	S- So,	no
3721	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	um.	no
3722	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I don't want you to have to be burdened with doing a lot of stuff. What - what can I do to - ?	no
3723	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Y- y- you said it would be easy for you to do that  top one there, and  I guess Don can do the segmentations of the,	no
3724	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	uh, channel F_?	no
3725	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
3726	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Um -	no
3727	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I mean, I can certainly help with, uh, retraining  the short male models,	no
3728	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
3729	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	uh, once we have the new data.	no
3730	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	You have models of short males?	no
3731	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3732	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Um -	no
3733	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right. Uh, let's see. The - the	no
3734	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	You - you can - I mean  you could -	no
3735	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	you could run the,	no
3736	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	um,	no
3737	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	you c- Basically, once	no
3738	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	the, um,	no
3739	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	The top one is done. I c-	no
3740	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	whe- the top - the top one's done, you could easily re-run the whole set of experiments.	no
3741	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I can re-do the  next one. Yeah.	no
3742	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
3743	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Uh, I mean,	no
3744	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	manage the jobs and so forth, uh -	no
3745	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah. Sure.	no
3746	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Um, that's all -	no
3747	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah, the -	no
3748	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	the bottom one would b- just be a matter of pointing it at a new set of files and kicking it off, so that would be re-	no
3749	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I mean, th- not the  bottom  one, but the  middle  one	no
3750	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
3751	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	would be really easy once you've got the top one going. I could do that.	no
3752	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3753	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
3754	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K. So I guess I just need to	no
3755	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	get Don to,	no
3756	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	uh -	no
3757	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right. So, somehow the -	no
3758	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Assuming he uses the new naming scheme, then	no
3759	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	he should call  the waveforms	no
3760	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	the - so, the waveform names have the, you know, meeting - meeting I_D,	no
3761	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	and the  microphone,	no
3762	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	and the,	no
3763	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	um -	no
3764	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I guess, the channel and the microphone and the speaker,	no
3765	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	um,	no
3766	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	speaker - some- something that identifies the speaker.	no
3767	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
3768	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So -	no
3769	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	To keep it the same but j- just change them all to channel F_?	no
3770	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Exactly. So, uh - well, you still need to be able to distinguish the different speakers.	no
3771	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	That's the key point. Because, if we wanna do what we just discussed - So -	no
3772	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right. Right.	no
3773	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3774	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Uh, uh, the - the best - the easiest way to do that would be to just take -	no
3775	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	You know, you make the channel be channel F_,	no
3776	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	but then keep the speaker names the same as they would be in the old -	no
3777	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3778	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K.	no
3779	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K.	no
3780	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	in the close-talking,	no
3781	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	uh,	no
3782	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	version.	no
3783	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K. And so that's something that Don would do - right? - when he creates these.	no
3784	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right. Exactly.	no
3785	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K. O_K.	no
3786	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So will you talk to him about that, or do you want me to talk to him?	no
3787	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I, uh, I - I can talk to him.	no
3788	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K.	no
3789	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	And then the bottom  one in terms of the test will be - ?	no
3790	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Uh -	no
3791	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	That will just be a copy of the one above it, except for  different models	no
3792	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Well, we also have to mean subtract the test data.	no
3793	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	from training.	no
3794	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Ah. O_K.	no
3795	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So, we need to run - ?	no
3796	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K.	no
3797	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Well, once we have the new, uh -	no
3798	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Well, once I do that, uh, second experiment, we'll have the,	no
3799	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	um,  files,  and I can give you those to - to process.	no
3800	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K.	no
3801	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	And there's, um,	no
3802	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	S- so the way this means subtraction expects to work, is it expects	no
3803	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	to have, um,	no
3804	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	this continuous stream of audio data	no
3805	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	from a particular speaker to operate on. And it goes along it with this sliding window,	no
3806	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	calculating the mean using the data in the window,	no
3807	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	and then subtracting that.	no
3808	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So, do you create this continuous stream from the individual utterance files?	no
3809	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I mean, uh -	no
3810	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	That's - that's how I've been doing it, just by concatenating files together.	no
3811	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Hmm.	no
3812	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Um, and if these files - and the- since they're individual utterance files, um,	no
3813	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	s- long silence periods are removed, which is a  good  thing.	no
3814	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Because this method might estimate the mean badly, if it had to face long silence periods.	no
3815	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	But that  does  mean that I need as much -	no
3816	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I need  twice  as much disk space as the original set	no
3817	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	cuz I need - while I'm running it - cuz I need to create this intermediate set,	no
3818	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	um, of these  big  files,	no
3819	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3820	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Hmm.	no
3821	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	and then  create the - finally, the mean subtracted, um, little files.	no
3822	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	And then I can get rid of the  big  files.	no
3823	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	But st- while I'm doing the processing, I'll nee- I need twice as much disk space.	no
3824	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K. I'm gonna - I'll check with, um,	no
3825	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Markham, and see what happened with the - the disks.	no
3826	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	He went to put those on a couple of weeks ago and something -	no
3827	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I think  Markham's out on  vacation.	no
3828	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I think, che- check with Dave. Yeah.	no
3829	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Oh, O_K. I'll ask David, then.	no
3830	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3831	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	You haven't seen new disks pop up, have you?	no
3832	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Nope.	no
3833	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I was wondering  if they were  in.	no
3834	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K.	no
3835	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3836	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Well, they grow them on trees now.	no
3837	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I thought they were like mushrooms.  They're popping up.	no
3838	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Well, he went to put  them   on -	no
3839	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Just, you  shake  them and they fall down.	no
3840	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3841	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	He went to put  them   on and then something happened.	no
3842	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3843	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	"And he sent around a note saying ""Oh, uh,"	no
3844	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah. Something w- went wrong.	no
3845	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	it didn't work, and	no
3846	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	"we'll have to schedule another time."" And then,"	no
3847	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	didn't see - nothing happened.	no
3848	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Nothing happened. No? Yeah.	no
3849	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So -	no
3850	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I'll check with David about that.	no
3851	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K.	no
3852	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K.	no
3853	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3854	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Cuz we still all have tha- the - that other one going, which is the, uh - the Macrophone	no
3855	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right, an- and -	no
3856	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	training.	no
3857	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So - so, Andreas, um,	no
3858	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm?	no
3859	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	in U_ doctor speech data S_R_I Hub-five, there's this, uh, Hub-five training set. Now, is that the long training set there?	no
3860	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mmm.	no
3861	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
3862	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
3863	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	That's everything. Yeah, so -	no
3864	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K.	no
3865	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So, I can give you a list of the short  version.	no
3866	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K. I th- I think you already did, actually.	no
3867	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So you can -	no
3868	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Oh, O_K.	no
3869	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K. And so, say the  Macrophone  files that are included in this short training, are just	no
3870	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	a  subset  of the Macrophone files. Right?	no
3871	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	That's right.	no
3872	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K. So - so, um - when you - You did some T_I-digits t- t- experiments training on Macrophone.	no
3873	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3874	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Um.	no
3875	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	But that's not necessarily any  less  data  than the S_R_I Hub-five	no
3876	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	set. It's not a - it's not a  subset  of the  short  S_R_I Hu- Hub-five set. Right?	no
3877	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Um -	no
3878	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Wel- No, it is.	no
3879	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Th- the -	no
3880	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Sorry. Um.	no
3881	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Can you repeat the question?  There wa- it is a subse- Yeah.	no
3882	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Uh, whe- when you trained on Macrophone, um, to do those digits experiments, did you use the  entire  Macrophone corpus?	no
3883	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	No. Only the portion that was in the Hub-five training set.	no
3884	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Oh. O_K.	no
3885	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	That was in the Hub-five  small  training set?	no
3886	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Well, the Hub-five small training set contains	no
3887	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	as much Macrophone as the large training set,	no
3888	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yes.	no
3889	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	for historical reasons. Yeah.	no
3890	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K- O_K. So -	no
3891	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Um -	no
3892	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So, do you have that processed there, then - right?	no
3893	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Because you already did - did y- didn't you already do that experiment?	no
3894	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I-	no
3895	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I - I got confused, cuz I thought - I thought you were using	no
3896	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
3897	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	the whole Macrophone set.	no
3898	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	No.	no
3899	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Um. O_K.	no
3900	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Well, if - if - if I just need to use that subset, I - I can get it processed. I actually  got -	no
3901	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I think I got f-	no
3902	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	into it before, and then I thought I was doing the wrong thing and I stopped. And it shouldn- it shouldn't take that long to do.	no
3903	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mmm.	no
3904	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K.	no
3905	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
3906	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K.	no
3907	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	And you need only the males. So.	no
3908	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Oh, O_K.	no
3909	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So, basically, Dave, so y- for you to get your processing going, you need the list of the, uh, wave-	no
3910	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Well, I guess it'll dep- you'll - you'll - we'll need to get the segmentations.	no
3911	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3912	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Figure out whether we're using the new or the old  from Don.	no
3913	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Hmm.	no
3914	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	And then, uh,	no
3915	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	from that you need the - from the segmentations you'll have the list of	no
3916	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	wavefiles that the short,	no
3917	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	uh, set is trained on.	no
3918	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	And then	no
3919	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	you'll need disk space. And once you've got   those  things, then you can start  your  processing. Right?	no
3920	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3921	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K.	no
3922	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Does this - th- this - ?	no
3923	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	It- it's sort of - f- f-	no
3924	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	not very nice to use the small training set for another reason, which is that the	no
3925	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	you also are losing on -	no
3926	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Again,	no
3927	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	because you don't use  all the data you have for one speaker.	no
3928	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So, the normalizations you compute for your training speakers will be,	no
3929	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	uh, crummier  than they would in the large training set.	no
3930	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So,	no
3931	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	um, I have to - So, to make it really a  matching  experiment, I have to find -	no
3932	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	uh, I have to	no
3933	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	use short models that were trained on  normalizations  that were also only estimated on the  short	no
3934	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	set.	no
3935	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Which is, uh -	no
3936	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Do you have this, uh - ?	no
3937	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I  think  so. I've - I -	no
3938	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I have to check. In any case, I could retrain short models within	no
3939	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	a few hours actually at - if I use	no
3940	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	machines at S_R_I.	no
3941	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I wonder about that, though.	no
3942	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Hmm?	no
3943	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I mean, because	no
3944	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	all  we're doing - The only reason we're using the short training set is - is for speed.	no
3945	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	And there - we're not really making any  claims  about using a smaller training set.	no
3946	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3947	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So as long as we're not using any testing data from -	no
3948	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	No. But the thing is, if - if we used -	no
3949	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	if we used the whole training set for normalizations,	no
3950	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3951	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	then  David would have to process much more data,	no
3952	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	which - That's a - that's one bottleneck, for us right, in terms of get-	no
3953	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Oh, you mean for - for  his  normalizations.	no
3954	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3955	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Oh, oh, oh. I'm sorry.	no
3956	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
3957	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So, you wanna do the exact same thing, or else  you'll have apples and oranges.	no
3958	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
3959	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3960	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So.	no
3961	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	It doesn't make - I don't think it makes  that  much of a difference. It's just this	no
3962	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	little detail that	no
3963	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
3964	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	if you can	no
3965	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	take care of that, then you should.	no
3966	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I - I think I have - I have the models, I have -	no
3967	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I have, um -	no
3968	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	let's see, um -	no
3969	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah. And if not I can retrain  those models very	no
3970	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Oh, there's - there's one other issue,	no
3971	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	quickly.	no
3972	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	uh, and that is that Dave throws out	no
3973	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	speakers that have less than twelve seconds of training data.	no
3974	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	And he said there were a few in the Macrophone set like that.	no
3975	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So, do we need to wait	no
3976	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	to find out who he's gonna throw out, so that we create	no
3977	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	a new set of short models that don't include those speakers?	no
3978	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Uh -	no
3979	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Say this again?	no
3980	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Sorry I missed it.	no
3981	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So i- in -	no
3982	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Th- the problem is that if we proceed like we just described,	no
3983	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	um,	no
3984	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	when he goes to	no
3985	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	m- um,	no
3986	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	create the new s- training  data with his processing, he throws out some speakers.	no
3987	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So the t- two training sets won't be identical.	no
3988	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3989	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	He throws out some speakers that are - that are very small.	no
3990	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah. Have just a little bit.	no
3991	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah. I don't think it'll make a - matter.	no
3992	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah. I think there was only a few	no
3993	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K.	no
3994	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	we thought to be the case. Righ- ?	no
3995	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	In fact, I thought about throwing those out too, because	no
3996	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	when I heard how little speech there was for some of them, I thought they can only hurt your models, because they're -	no
3997	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	again their normalizations will be all -	no
3998	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah.	no
3999	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
4000	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	all - all over the map, and	no
4001	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	you won't get	no
4002	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	very - very clean	no
4003	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	models from them, anyhow. So.	no
4004	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So you think it's O_K, then?	no
4005	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah. In fact,	no
4006	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	if - if you wanna do this, uh, to speed things up,	no
4007	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	um,	no
4008	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	you - we can leave out the Macrophone data altogether.	no
4009	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	That hurt -	no
4010	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Actually. Oh, no. Sorry.	no
4011	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Not in the short. Then you have too little data. O_K.	no
4012	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Sorry. Forget that.	no
4013	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Um,	no
4014	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	When you use - when you go to the large training set,	no
4015	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	then  leaving out Macrophone	no
4016	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	actually sometimes  helps  you, because it's -	no
4017	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	it- it's just not relevant to the -	no
4018	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	It's read.	no
4019	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	to the meeting and - or to  conversational  speech anyway.	no
4020	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K.	no
4021	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah. Leave it out, and -	no
4022	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Um, in the event that I retrain the short models,	no
4023	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	um, why don't you give me a list of the files that you throw out, and I - I'll throw them out, too.	no
4024	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
4025	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	And then we have complete -	no
4026	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	completely  identical training conditions.	no
4027	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	We sh-	no
4028	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	M- Right.	no
4029	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	A- actually you should be able to figure out,	no
4030	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Dave, right, once you know the segmentations,	no
4031	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
4032	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	uh, who you're going to -	no
4033	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	which speakers will get left out, even before you run your processing. Right?	no
4034	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	The segmentations?	no
4035	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah. The segmentations from Don?	no
4036	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	But th- the segmentations are only -	no
4037	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Once we - ?	no
4038	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Oh.	no
4039	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	they only affect the  test  set.	no
4040	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	We're talking about the  training  speakers.	no
4041	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Ah. Right, right, right, right, right.	no
4042	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	No. The training set he could go through right now, and see how - how long the -	no
4043	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
4044	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right. But I'm just wondering how long it will take to get	no
4045	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	that information.	no
4046	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Um -	no
4047	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	He already has the in- you already have the information.  Right?	no
4048	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	I - I have i- I have it for -	no
4049	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	for Macrophone, um,	no
4050	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	already, I  think,  and, um, I think by tomorrow I'll have it	no
4051	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
4052	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K.	no
4053	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	for th- for the rest.	no
4054	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Alright.	no
4055	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K.	no
4056	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	O_K.	no
4057	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	At that one?  Maybe.	no
4058	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Uh -	no
4059	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Been looking at synthesizers?	no
4060	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Synthesizers?	no
4061	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	You were looking at Festival. Yeah.	no
4062	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Yeah, yeah. I was doing something for  the SmartKom data collectioners.	no
4063	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Robert has taken his laptop t- back to Germany so we needed a new synthesis machine.	no
4064	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	And we have now a SUN workstation in the library,	no
4065	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	which does the synthesis and the Festival speech s- s- system is  running on   it.	no
4066	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Sorry, Robert did what?	no
4067	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Robert took what?	no
4068	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	His laptop where, uh -	no
4069	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	which we used for the SmartKom data collection, for the synthesis.	no
4070	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Uh-huh.	no
4071	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	And so he took it to Germany	no
4072	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	and  so we couldn't do any data collection. Uh -	no
4073	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Oh.	no
4074	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Is he gone now?	no
4075	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	No. He's just gone to a SmartKom workshop.	no
4076	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Oh.	no
4077	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Oh, oh. Oh, O_K.	no
4078	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	And so, we have now the SUN in the library which can do that.	no
4079	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Ah.	no
4080	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	And I looked into the ts- F_zero thing and talked to -	no
4081	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	to Liz, and it seems that	no
4082	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	it's quite	no
4083	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	s-	no
4084	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	what she wants, but we'll	no
4085	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	have to think about the - the  energy   thing - uh, what we wanna do.	no
4086	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Right.	no
4087	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	This was a business about, uh,	no
4088	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	um,	no
4089	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	coming up with something that - that was purely prosodic.	no
4090	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Mm-hmm.	no
4091	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	And so, uh, we're just gonna	no
4092	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	use a pitch detector, drive a synthesizer, and	no
4093	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	since it doesn't have a hook in it for, uh, modifying energy, we'll have a little	no
4094	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	box at the output that'll modify the energy.	no
4095	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	So -	no
4096	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Hmm.	no
4097	transcript	transcript_Bmr029	Hmm.	no

4190	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4191	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	What's this one here? This - this one is - has a couple of cheezy  electrettes  and -	no
4192	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah, that's -  that's the dummy - dummy P_D_A.	no
4193	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	That's connected too, or - ?	no
4194	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yep.	no
4195	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah, it  is.	no
4196	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	That's connected.	no
4197	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	It's got two - to both channels.	no
4198	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah, both channels.	no
4199	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Oh, hang on.	no
4200	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no

4203	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yep.	no
4204	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	O_K.	no
4205	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	This is -	no
4206	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Although the gain  is pretty low.	no
4207	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So for the um  read numbers task,	no
4208	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Mm-hmm.	no
4209	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Hang on, let's - let's -	no
4210	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I have extracted these -	no
4211	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	O_K let's just - let's just name the microphones.	no
4212	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	O_K.	no
4213	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So I'm speaking on the  ear mounted  uh wired headset thing.	no
4214	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	O_K.	no
4215	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right and I'm now talking on microphone number two,	no
4216	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	uh, the  wireless  microphone number two.	no
4217	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4218	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Um, I have no idea which one I'm - I'm on. Oh one! Oh, I'm number one.	no
4219	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I'm -	no
4220	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	You're on one.	no
4221	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Absolutely.	no
4222	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	O_K,  which is a - a l- a lapel, in fact it's sticking through my  lapel.	no
4223	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yes.	no
4224	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	O_K so this is - this is the P_Z_M nearest the eh	no
4225	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	eh the  machine  room end of the table.	no
4226	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Actually, i-	no
4227	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Then  there's - I  know,  but yeah.  It's number three, it says, but  we'll be able to figure it out. This is at the middle of the table	no
4228	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	This further down the table.	no
4229	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	And this - this one is right at the end of the table, O_K?	no
4230	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	And then we've got the uh -	no
4231	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	This is the  left  side of the dummy P_D_A and	no
4232	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	this would be the right side.	no
4233	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I think listening to this is gonna be like watching somebody's home movies.  @@	no
4234	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yes, it'll be pretty horrible.	no
4235	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah, O_K.	no
4236	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Very exciting.	no
4237	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So, what I have on these forms here is for the read numbers - read digits tasks and it's extracted directly from Aurora  and uh -	yes
4238	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So, what I have on these forms here is for the read numbers - read digits tasks and it's extracted directly from Aurora  and uh -	no
4239	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So what I was thinking is we could start just by filling it out and then reading - reading the numbers on the form.	no
4240	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	O_K, what do we do with the stuff on top?	no
4241	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Fill it out.	no
4242	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	But I -	no
4243	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Do we say it after we -	no
4244	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	No. Just write it down.	no
4245	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	No, you don't need to.	no
4246	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	What are we - why are we writing it down?	no
4247	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So that  when we  transcribe the data we can figure out who said it and their gender and the date and the time and what mike they were on and all that sort of thing.	no
4248	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Oh.	no
4249	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	O_K	no
4250	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	That's good. So I don't need to fill that out right now. So maybe we should just say it.	no
4251	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	W-	no
4252	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	O_K.	no
4253	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Why don't you want to fill it out right now? Just so that -	no
4254	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So then we're not spending the time writing it out. So that we're spending the time talking.	no
4255	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well, how about  you give me one of those and we can fill it out and  Morgan  can read and then we can do it like  that.	no
4256	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I'm just uh concerned about a bunch of dead time while we all sit here and fill out the things.	no
4257	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	O_K.	no
4258	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah, yeah, yeah.	no
4259	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right?	no
4260	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	And so you have to be sure to pause  between each line, since we're going to be segmenting it and then  doing it that way.	no
4261	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Oh.	no
4262	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right.	no
4263	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	O_K, so this is Morgan. I'm going to read some numbers now.	no

4300	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	This is - these are things we will find out.	no
4301	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	That'll be an issue.	no
4302	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yep.	no
4303	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.  I don't know if I said mine was transcript zero, but it  was.	no
4304	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Mm-hmm!	no
4305	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Oh, good.	no

4309	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Can I	no
4310	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So, so where are we in this? Let's see, so we now - we now have a few mikes that work. How long did it take you to set this up?	no
4311	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	have something to write on the back of?	yes
4312	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So, so where are we in this? Let's see, so we now - we now have a few mikes that work. How long did it take you to set this up?	no
4313	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	have something to write on the back of?	no
4314	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Thanks.	no
4315	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Oh! It didn't - doesn't take - Well, I mean as you  see  we haven't really set it up that  well,  but it doesn't - it doesn't take long to set up. I mean,	no
4316	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	We just came up here  one night after  recording  so it took like twenty minutes something like that.	no
4317	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right and that - that included a fair amount of fiddling around,	no
4318	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I mean it's -	no
4319	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah,  I mean the  equipment  -	no
4320	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	since it's - it's more or less the first time we've tried to do it.	no
4321	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right.	no
4322	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	The equip- Me and Adam went through it yesterday, just looked at everything. But it's all kind of  here  and set up, so it's just a question of turning it all  on.	no
4323	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	And, um -	no
4324	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I mean, ev- eventually we'll want to like	no
4325	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	running the program.	no
4326	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	tape that over and run them up through the center so that wires aren't - aren't - people aren't tripping over the wires and so on.	no
4327	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right.	no
4328	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Are we gonna - I mean, is it gonna be over there, or is it gonna be in there?	no
4329	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Um, it's - it's gonna b- it's - for reasons - because of the microphones runs we want that chunk  there.  There's more equipment in  there.	no
4330	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	But there's -  the idea is that there are  these microphones on the  table,  there are some  cables  coming down  sort of under a nice  mat,	no
4331	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	and then that's -  they - a bunch of them get sort of converged  with  digital there.	no
4332	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	And the idea is that this gets replaced by a cabinet with doors, so that -  so that it's not  open to fiddling.	no
4333	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So that's what's gonna happen.	no
4334	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right.	no
4335	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	That's	no
4336	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Do we have like a  cabinet on order or do we just need to do that?	no
4337	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	We need to  do  that. It's on a list of things to do.  I keep on hoping that  they're gonna get done but they don't.	no
4338	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well, I -  I can help them get done um one question is budget. Do we have any money at all that we can go out and spend on things like cabinets or a hard drive or things like that.	no
4339	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I -	no
4340	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah!	no
4341	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Oh - I mean, I don't know. Did we s- did we spend our - the budget already that we had?	no
4342	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4343	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Uh, how much  are we talking about here?	no
4344	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Um.	no
4345	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I don't know. A cabinet is probably going to cost  a hundred dollars, two hundred dollars something like that.	no
4346	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I mean.	no
4347	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah, I mean, you know, we - we can spend under a thousand dollars or something without - without worrying about it.	no
4348	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4349	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I mean, I think - um  I'm  more  worried about things being kept in a funky state long enough that - that uh stuff gets broken or - or	no
4350	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4351	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	you know.	no
4352	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well, I think our intention at this point is when we're not using it to record a meeting we'll coil them all up and put them under  so that people will not be tripping over them and so on.	no
4353	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4354	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So.	no
4355	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	But,  well we should get to a - a nice kind of working state of our set up  as quickly as possible.	no
4356	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	"Yeah, and there's also the minor matter, it'd be  kind  of nice to able to  bring people in and say ""yes, this is where we do such-and-such"","	no
4357	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right. Not have it -	no
4358	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	and then be able to see uh,	no
4359	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4360	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	you know,	no
4361	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	some kind of - I mean it's	no
4362	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	less important than doing what we're doing right now but -	no
4363	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4364	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So.	no
4365	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I mean  there's one big issue with the equipment still,	no
4366	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	which is um	no
4367	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	ultimately we're gonna - well the idea is to have	no
4368	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	any number of these wired headsets, but	no
4369	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	there's this amplification problem.	no
4370	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I built this thing, it's - that's - it's very noisy. We're actually recording - I'm -  I'm  going through it at the moment,  but it's so noisy that I am not using for  this.	no
4371	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	it's - it's designed to be used for the - for the desktop  meeting  as well.	no
4372	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	But I'm using - running that through my uh   damp  machine as a pre-amp as an alternative.	no
4373	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well, we  should  be able to just go buy some  preamps,   I would think.	no
4374	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4375	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	It's just - it eh	no
4376	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	You see how clumsy this is right? I have to use these batteries to bias them.	no
4377	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	And I'm only get two channels and there're a bunch of -	no
4378	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	There are like three connectors in the circuit.	no
4379	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	The thing is, like,	no
4380	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	it's -	no
4381	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	it's not s- it's not that the thing doesn't  exist   commercially, but there isn't one unit which does the whole thing in one - in one  swoop.	no
4382	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So it seemed like it was a good idea to  make  one.	no
4383	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	um	no
4384	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	And I'm  still  not  sure.  I mean, I think  I probably know how to fix this. I can probably	no
4385	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4386	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	build it better so it doesn't have such noise, but	no
4387	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	it's kind of  a buy .	no
4388	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well, ultimately we're gonna need to build one anyway.	no
4389	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Are we?	no
4390	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Sure. Because we- we're gonna have to put it in a P_D_A.	no
4391	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well, we  could  just -	no
4392	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well.	no
4393	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right? If we have microphones in a P_D_A it's gonna need	no
4394	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	bias and  a pre-amp.	no
4395	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I guess I'd sort of figured that - that Jim would do that at some  point.  Right?	no
4396	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Mm-hmm.	no
4397	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4398	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well n-	no
4399	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4400	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Jim is busy at the moment. That's the  problem.  I was kind of hoping that Jim was going to build this box.	no
4401	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	But um - but he hasn't had time.	no
4402	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4403	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well , I think - I think he  is  quite interested in doing it. But.	no
4404	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	O_K.	no
4405	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well	no
4406	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	If it's  too  noisy and if there's something we can buy, again for, you know,  moderate  amount of price, even if it takes a  couple  boxes or something, maybe we should just do it.	no
4407	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4408	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4409	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	And then - and then  later  we can  uh replace it with -	no
4410	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Because there may be other considerations  that will go into the design. I mean, uh	no
4411	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	our getting some experience with this may help to determine  some of things that are - I don't know - might change this design,	no
4412	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Mm-hmm.	no
4413	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right.	no
4414	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So.	no
4415	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	There was uh a statement made	no
4416	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	uh	no
4417	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	which I don't think is  right,  by the way, but -	no
4418	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	there was a statement made at the uh DARPA Communicator meeting I was at recently	no
4419	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	that um	no
4420	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	microphone - multiple microphones  at a distance of less than  three feet or something like that were  totally  useless,  completely  irrelevant.	no
4421	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Oh!	no
4422	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4423	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	You - you mean for noise cancelling, or - ?	no
4424	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	for nois- noise cancelling.	no
4425	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Um,	no
4426	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	my counter argument is - is an - uh uh um, a white rat.	no
4427	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	uh, which  has th- it's two microphones exceedingly close together and it works pretty well.	no
4428	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Oh.	no
4429	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Um but -	no
4430	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	O_K.	no
4431	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4432	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	This   happened .	no
4433	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Do they mean  omnidirectional, is that their point? I mean all the noise cancelling mikes, they're - you know, they're a few m- millimeters away from each other pointing in different directions.	no
4434	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I think -  uh, I mean, uh my  guess  is that means it's just that if it's - if it's  near  field,  the mathematics of beam -  beam steering is different.	no
4435	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	But.	no
4436	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Oh, I see.	no
4437	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	If the f- if the wavefronts are  not  approximately  planar   then you can't just do delay and sum and expect it to work.	no
4438	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	It's  - Oh, O_K, so they're not talking about  how far apart the  mikes  are, they're talking about how far they are from the  speaker.	no
4439	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I  guess.  Yeah.	no
4440	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right. But I think that if - my point is I guess if you - if you have a um -	no
4441	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	a uh s- a  volume  in between  the two - the two uh uh  sensors	no
4442	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4443	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	and you do something  cleverer,	no
4444	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	there clearly are ways  to get more out of it.	no
4445	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4446	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah, yeah.	no
4447	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4448	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right, right, right. I mean the - um	no
4449	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	The - the weird thing is that actually  delay in some beam-forming is not - is not the clever thing to do.  The -	no
4450	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	the - the underwater guys do this stuff which is  different.	no
4451	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	And it actually means that you should get the microphones as close together as possible.	no
4452	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Rather than trying to get them far apart so you can get  separation, you sort of -  you want them very close. And -	no
4453	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	And  the math is too difficult for me to understand but it's - but it's there.	no
4454	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4455	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well, there are various points in meeting where people were making uh uh  very  strong statements as a matter of  fact,  like one shouldn't even question it and	no
4456	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	this was one of them that  was kind of  funny.	no
4457	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Um but I - I - I - what I take it to mean is doing - doing the dumb thing	no
4458	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4459	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	uh with two microphones would be very difficult to get too much out of it but	no
4460	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4461	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I think it will be  interesting  to do other things that aren't dumb.	no
4462	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So I - I still think it's potentially   interesting to do that. Although we- we'll have to be uh a- aware of this if we're writing proposals about it,	no
4463	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Hmm.	no
4464	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	"wherever, that there may well be reviewers who will say, ""well everyone  knows  that  you can't get anything out of it if it's -  if it's close""."	no
4465	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4466	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Do they believe you can get speaker location out of it? Cuz that's - that's one way we could sneak it in.	no
4467	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Uh, that is an interesting point.	no
4468	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah. Certainly you can	no
4469	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4470	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well we could -	no
4471	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	get some -	no
4472	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I mean. By the time -  We'll have - we'll have data so we can actually  you know, demonstrate that.	no
4473	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4474	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well.	no
4475	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Hopefully.	no
4476	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Oh, you mean for location?	no
4477	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4478	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	O_K. Depends on who's working on it.	no
4479	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well,  we're getting some -	no
4480	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	we- we're getting some right  now.	no
4481	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah, right.	no
4482	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	but someone has to write some software to - to actually do it. Someone might.	no
4483	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right. Right. But I mean.	no
4484	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well someone- someone might be interested in - in it.	no
4485	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Oh that's uh - I was just thinking one thing we may wanna do is put the fake P_D_A right in front of someone	no
4486	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	instead of in the middle of the table like we have it now.	no
4487	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	on the thought that - my vision of it is you know each of us will have our little P_D_A in front of us  and so the acoustics - uh you might want to try to match the acoustics.	no
4488	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4489	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Maybe.	no
4490	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4491	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	But on the other hand,	no
4492	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	suppose that uh, you're the only one uh who is  advanced  enough in this  thinking  to actually  bring  such a P_D_A to - to a  meeting	no
4493	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	No, and I don't need to meet with  those  people.	no
4494	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	and - and -	no
4495	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	and therefore  you  bring it  in,   and you probably want it to be as  near  to people as  possible  so you might in fact  shove  it to the middle of the  table.	no
4496	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Mm-hmm.	no
4497	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well.	no
4498	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yep, yep.  For those those we can make several - several more of these	no
4499	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	and then we can have actual  recording with you know three  P_D_As.	no
4500	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4501	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well, I  think  we  should.	no
4502	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I mean, I think at  least  with  two.   Right?	no
4503	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Mm-hmm.	no
4504	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right.	no
4505	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Because uh one of the th- one of the fantasies that was at least fun to  talk  about was that uh	no
4506	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	uh O_K maybe you th-	no
4507	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	you're -	no
4508	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	the range of things you can do with multiple microphones is limited if they're a few inches apart,	no
4509	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	but  what if you have  two  of these things?	no
4510	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4511	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	"And you know we have this - this idea of the handshake  back and forth and say ""I'm here, I'm here""  ""We're now an array."""	no
4512	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4513	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right.	no
4514	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right, right.	no
4515	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.  And that - that seems very uh  easy to believe scenario, I mean, given the number of palm pilots we've got on the table right now, so.	no
4516	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	That's right.	no
4517	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Three, right?  So I guess this a pretty dense group but it- it's getting a lot higher.	no
4518	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4519	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah	no
4520	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah, but -  But that - it's	no
4521	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	We're not, even, you know  - It's - we're just - It's not like we -	no
4522	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	We - we may be  technical,  but we're not particularly P_D_A people.	no
4523	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So it's - That's just how it is.	no
4524	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well, I'm  trying  to be. So.	no
4525	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well, I know. Well, that's true. I mean.	no
4526	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Except I s- got a P_D_A way before - Well I was doing hand- I was doing wearable computers at Boeing, so I guess I sort of count.  But.	no
4527	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	O_K.	no
4528	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So uh - so where are we  uh now? I mean so we've just -	no
4529	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	uh We're doing this recording so we show  we can - we're capable of doing recording	no
4530	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right.	no
4531	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	uh there's  I guess a little more wiring to do or something to have - to have more - if we had more people participating in the meeting we'd wouldn't quite be ready for that.	no
4532	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Mm-hmm.	no
4533	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Uh.	no
4534	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well we've got - we've got - Right now we could have two more people on wireless,  with a trip to Leo's Audio we could get a third extra person on wireless,  and uh  right  now  we could have three more -  three more people wearing mikes like  this,  and that would just work. I mean I'm not sure how -  how good the quality is on this mike but I  think  it's going to be O_K.	no
4535	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Mm-hmm.	no
4536	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So we  could  actually have  eight people with - with headset mikes  with, I mean, basically no extra effort.	no
4537	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well.	no
4538	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Five with wireless.  So we could have eight.	no
4539	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4540	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Nine.	no
4541	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Nine.  Excuse me, nine. Five with wireless and four without,	no
4542	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4543	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4544	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	and four with  wired.	no
4545	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Um, we don't have  headsets though.	no
4546	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah. We have the um - the ones we've been using, the ones we got for the P_C.	no
4547	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Oh, O_K so we just have to c-  wander around and collect them up.	no
4548	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah, yeah. I think we have three of those.	no
4549	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Mm-hmm.	no
4550	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So, and the h-	no
4551	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Uh, there's one in my office. So.	no
4552	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right, right.  They don't all work, but the nice ones, the um Plan- Plantronic ones work.	no
4553	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	O_K.	no
4554	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So, we'll just have to see if that works.	no
4555	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So a little bit of futzing, there's the issue about a cabinet, we might want to change some pre-amps.	no
4556	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4557	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So we can do some more recordings but there's - there's a little - little bit of ramp up  on that over the next month,  say.	no
4558	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah, yeah.	no
4559	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right and also I would like to work out some of the  software issues a little more  completely. So,	yes
4560	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right and also I would like to work out some of the  software issues a little more  completely. So,	no
4561	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	um, you know, we're gonna want to resample and con- and bring them over to another machine	no
4562	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4563	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4564	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4565	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	and uh  um  organize the - how we're gonna store it all.	no
4566	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4567	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah we were talking about that a little bit over coffee today, that - that um	no
4568	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	uh if you  downsample  it sounded like it came - it sounded like it was something like a gig- gigabyte an hour if you didn't downsample and once you downsampled then it was something like four hundred megabytes an hour,	no
4569	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	if you used all - if you used all - no, if you used all the channels.  Something like that?	no
4570	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Per channel, or - ?	no
4571	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	We figured out that it was t- twelve gig-	no
4572	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	It was more than that.	no
4573	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	twelve  gigabytes an hour?  For - for all the channels?  Was that with or without the -	no
4574	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I thought it was  one  gigabyte.	no
4575	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	It couldn't be  twelve.	no
4576	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Cuz no, we've only - no, I mean we've only got four gigabytes and that	no
4577	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	We said, four gigabytes  would give us twenty minutes  before we did anything else.	no
4578	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4579	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right. And then we - then we cut it in half.	no
4580	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	And then we cut in half,  by -	no
4581	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	How'd you cut it?	no
4582	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	But -	no
4583	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	By s-  saving sixteen bits  on  instead of thirty - instead of thirty-two.	no
4584	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	O_K, so that's - so that's two gigabytes.	no
4585	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	And then -	no
4586	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well no I mean it's	no
4587	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	That's forty minutes	no
4588	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	uh four gigabytes for forty minutes.	no
4589	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right. But that's at forty four kilohertz with sixteen channels.	no
4590	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So, six gigabytes.	no
4591	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Forty-eight kilohertz,  yeah.	no
4592	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So we can actually  triple  that.	no
4593	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So you can - right, so you can	no
4594	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4595	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So, hang on - so that would - O_K	no
4596	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I came out at the gig an hour,  at one point. That - that's one computation I did for sixteen channels, sixteen bit.	no
4597	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well I think it's -	no
4598	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I think it's two gig an hour.	no
4599	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Is it two gig an hour? I'm off by an order of magni- That's alright. Order of two.   Factor  of two.	no
4600	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Cuz like, we don't -  Maybe we don't - We don't need to save all channels, right? So, on average.	no
4601	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	We could - we don't - we - we wouldn't use all the channels, necessarily.	no
4602	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Oh, we'll do the higher math later, maybe but it's - so it's - so maybe like a gig or two a - an hour, um but - um -	no
4603	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4604	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	O_K, that is a bit more than I thought.	no
4605	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	How much here would we have to reformat the drive in there	no
4606	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	to get some of the more space  cuz it - I mean it's a nine gig drive and	no
4607	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4608	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	there's four gig on sc- on scratch and there's  about three gig unused, it  looked  like, on the  home  directory.	no
4609	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I'm sure.  Yeah.	no
4610	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I just don't know enough about LINUX. How hard is it to  repartition?	no
4611	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	It's a pain.	no
4612	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	It's a pain.	no
4613	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	"I mean, you know, because - cuz we've got data on ""user"", right? And then we'd have to"	no
4614	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Mm-hmm.	no
4615	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	back it all up and  copy it back on again.	no
4616	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah so this'll take some thought cuz we have - we -	no
4617	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	um	no
4618	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	If we are in fact gonna have forty or fifty hours at some point and we - we wanna ha- have part of our work be	no
4619	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	on feature extraction, it means that we need to have waveforms available  somehow.	no
4620	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4621	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Hmm.	no
4622	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	"Right. So I've - I've already created a ""U_ - U_, doctor speech, data, M_R"" directory,"	no
4623	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	or had Jane do it and uh	no
4624	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	um -	no
4625	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	but there's not a lot of free space around.	no
4626	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So it - it - it has currently about four gig	no
4627	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	No.	no
4628	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Mm-hmm.	no
4629	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	on the drive that I think she's going to put it on um.	no
4630	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Mm-hmm.	no
4631	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	And so we need - we definitely need to go  buy  uh  you know forty gig - fifty gig of drive - drive space.	no
4632	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4633	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	We don't need all - we don't necessarily need it all on-line. I mean it will be different subsets.  So you won't - you won't, you know, do all  sixteen channels in a single -	no
4634	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	That's true. I hadn't even thought about that,	no
4635	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	although it'd be kind of interesting.	no
4636	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4637	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	What would you do? I mean -	no
4638	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	You typically train - I mean you'd have fi- you'd have fifty hours we'd only use  one of the P_Z_M channels, something like this, and so that would- you wouldn't have to use all sixteen channels  at once.	no
4639	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	But it's kind of   painful  for -	no
4640	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	because basically,	no
4641	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	if we put them on C_Ds then each C_D will have  all the channels for one  recording,	no
4642	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	and then when you want to build the P_files, you just want to get one of those files off each of  the sessions and -	no
4643	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah, it's pretty horrible.	no
4644	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So what would we  do  for training? So if we're - if we're training distant mi- we'd just use  one  of them?	no
4645	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah. Well, maybe  two  of them, but I mean we wouldn't use - we'd only use the distant mikes, right?	no
4646	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	O_K.	no
4647	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah so it might be  four.	no
4648	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right? But it wouldn't be  sixteen.	no
4649	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well, although we wanted to get  alignments  from the  close  mike  stuff.	no
4650	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	But that's a separate training.	no
4651	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right.  But you don't want to be constantly take - putting that on disk and off disk and on disk.	no
4652	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	No wait. More disk is better. Absolutely. I mean  my - my preference would be to get - get ourselves a hundred gig of disk.  And just not bother.	no
4653	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4654	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	The thing is it's  really  not very  expensive  right now.	no
4655	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4656	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So it's more of an issue of - of structuring it with uh the uh Sys Admin folks so we don't panic them and	no
4657	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	And back up.	no
4658	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	figuring out where it goes.	no
4659	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well, we don't - it doesn't need to be backed up.	no
4660	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right if - if we -	no
4661	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	if we burn it all on C_D-ROM,	no
4662	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right, then it doesn't need to be backed up.	no
4663	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	then,	no
4664	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	um, in fact, we could	no
4665	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	you know - we could throw away the Broadcast News stuff and put it on there or something like that.	no
4666	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah, we were talking about that. I'm not sure if anyone's  still using it.	no
4667	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4668	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I think the only one using it has been Javier,	no
4669	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Somebody used it recently.	no
4670	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	but at this point I think it's - he's  only  been using it for features that he calculated quite a while ago,	no
4671	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4672	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	so if nobody else is doing  feature calculation -	no
4673	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I'll send mail to speech local.	no
4674	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I'll send mail to speech local and see if anyone's still using it.	no
4675	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Pardon?	no
4676	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	How much space is that using up? Do you have any idea?	no
4677	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	It's uh twenty C_Ds, so that's twelve gigabytes.	no
4678	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So that would last us for a while.	no
4679	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah, couple hours!	no
4680	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well, anyway for this - this recording we're fine cuz we're only - we're only - how many mikes are we recording right now?	no
4681	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4682	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well, right now we don't have any choice. It r- still records all sixteen channels. It's just most of them are all zeroes.	no
4683	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So that - that's on our list too.	no
4684	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	O_K.	no
4685	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4686	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah, well that we can	no
4687	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	do something about.	no
4688	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yep.	no
4689	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	It's mostly a question of user interface. How do we - how do we specify which ones are on?	no
4690	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4691	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah, so we don't store any of our audio formats compressed in any way do we?	no
4692	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So these large sections when you guys aren't talking -	no
4693	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4694	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Probably,  we could - we could probably just run Shorten on them or something and it will get a big win.	no
4695	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I think that's a good -	no
4696	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Run  what  on those?	no
4697	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Shorten.	no
4698	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Tony Robinson's  uh lossless compression thing.	no
4699	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	O_K.	no
4700	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	What's  it  do?	no
4701	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Um,	no
4702	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	it -	no
4703	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	it does  A_R  modeling	no
4704	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	and so it looks at a section,	no
4705	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	it runs an A_R model to sort of r- w- to  whiten  it	no
4706	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	and then quantizes  the residual  with a nice - with the three bits it can get away with. Something like that.	no
4707	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So I think it - On - on each block it'll -  it'll compress you know if there's  load on in any range  it'll use ratio bits. I  think  it does that.	no
4708	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Mm-hmm.	no
4709	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah, so, P_Z_Ms.	no
4710	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	@@	no
4711	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah, well.	no
4712	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4713	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah, it's something that - that we definitely need to look at with this.	no
4714	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Maybe we shouldn't've  subsampled it down to sixteen bits  for our first try.	no
4715	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well, it's O_K, it's only the first try. I - what I'm thinking is um  obviously we can do the - we can - we can choose any sixteen bits from the  twenty- four, so we can just have different gain things that we use  you know per channel.	no
4716	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right.	no
4717	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah, so we might wanna see if maybe the low sixteen bits on the P_Z_Ms are better than the middle  sixteen bits.	no
4718	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4719	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I think -   probably  the bottom four bits are not any good,	no
4720	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Regardless, yeah.	no
4721	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right? Although you know it  claims  they are. But probably	no
4722	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	the -	no
4723	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	W- I was just noticing on the - on the - there's a view meter, software view meter and the P_Z_M gain is real low.  So.	no
4724	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah, so I think  initially  we should take up more space until we've analyzed this and get a better sense of it because	no
4725	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Mm-hmm.	no
4726	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	uh we don- I mean we're not talking about forty or fifty hours at this point we're talking about  a half hour of - of speech and so	no
4727	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4728	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yep.	no
4729	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4730	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	uh we should look at this carefully  but -	no
4731	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah, I was  interested when I saw the twenty-four on there. Wow, I mean that's probably  eight  bits of noise. Yeah. So.	no
4732	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Oh, yeah!	no
4733	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Oh yeah!	no
4734	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah, that's right.  We've got  lots  of bits of noise.	no
4735	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	These  theories things  are pretty amazing.	no
4736	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4737	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	And	no
4738	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	And there's  help - help they seem - they seem good though they seem to be	no
4739	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	It's some sort of oversampling thing I imagine, right?	no
4740	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Didn't we already get that? Cuz you -	no
4741	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Oh, God knows. Yeah, yeah.	no
4742	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	you can't have  uh component tolerances that are  uh  sixteen million - one in sixteen million parts, so.	no
4743	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right.	no
4744	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right.	no
4745	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right the other - other thing  another issue is just getting a sound card up here.	yes
4746	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right.	no
4747	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right the other - other thing  another issue is just getting a sound card up here.	no
4748	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	You know, I assumed that we could just put a sound blaster in if we want sound output.	no
4749	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	That - that card - that machine's got sound - They've got a sound blaster built into it.	no
4750	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Oh, it's just not working.	no
4751	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I just - I just disabled it cuz I wanted to find out	no
4752	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	how well the  sound infrastructure would deal with both at once	no
4753	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	O_K.	no
4754	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	but I think yeah, that's, uh -	no
4755	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	probably it will be fine.	no
4756	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah, that way we don't - we can't listen to it  on this machine.	no
4757	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I'm s-	no
4758	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	There's no,	no
4759	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Oh!	no
4760	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	For a couple of reasons.	no
4761	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well, but the  @@  -	no
4762	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	There are  two  ways we  could  listen to it. There's a sound - there's actually sound output built into  this  thing.  But the driver - I haven't - the driver may not support it yet.  And then there's also the sound or the sound card built in. But I don't know how to - I don't know how the  operating system would like having two sound cards.	no
4763	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4764	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Hmm.	no
4765	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	But we can F_T_P stuff over, right? So  it's connected.	no
4766	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right.	no
4767	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4768	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	And we've  looked  at it so we know it's working. I mean, you can see the little squiggles, and it looks like speech  so   You just can't listen.	no
4769	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4770	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4771	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4772	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	O_K.	no
4773	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Um.	no
4774	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	One suggestion I have is that um	yes
4775	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	One suggestion I have is that um	no
4776	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I think this -  maybe we should just read some more - you made more of these, right? I think we should read some more	no
4777	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right.	no
4778	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	O_K.	no
4779	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	because - because this is very f- we -	no
4780	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	we need to - to work the - the - the uh - the talkers more because we're not gonna have  that  many meetings	no
4781	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Mm-hmm.	no
4782	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	and this is a pretty  tiny  amount of data.	no
4783	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Mm-hmm.	no
4784	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So maybe we should do another   number list and  -	no
4785	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well right I - I just did ten per page I could easily do twenty per page.	no
4786	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	It's just a question of uh  of how much uh annoyance I wanted to put uh people going to meetings through.	no
4787	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4788	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well this is us. We'll have a fair amount of annoyance yeah I think  uh.	no
4789	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Mm-hmm.	no
4790	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4791	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So, can we do - we do another set? Are we - are we - are we - sort of -	no
4792	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Sure.	no
4793	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Sure.	no
4794	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	we talked out about what we're -	no
4795	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well no, O_K, the question I still have about what we're going to do is	yes
4796	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well no, O_K, the question I still have about what we're going to do is	no
4797	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	O_K.	no
4798	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right.	no
4799	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	what is - what - eh - O_K, so we can get the equipment set up so that	no
4800	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	basically we're in a situation where we can -  with, you know, ten minutes of preparation, we can bring  nine people in here and do a  multi- channel recording.	no
4801	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Um.	no
4802	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	What are - wh- When are we - Are we going to do that? Who are they going to be? What meetings are we going to record?	no
4803	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Us, to begin with.	no
4804	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So which - which meetings - What meetings do we have?	no
4805	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I think that's the intention.	no
4806	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	"I mean like ""us"" being the Meeting Recorder people or ""us"" being anything that speech  local does."	no
4807	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well, I think -	no
4808	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I think, um, certainly us, Meeting Recorder.	no
4809	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4810	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Um, us  other  groups. It just depends on how  many  meetings we're - we're having. Um.	no
4811	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Jerry  also said it would be -  he  would be willing to have  his  group, some of the A_I meetings do it as well.	no
4812	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	And we should have like - we should have Decoder meetings and stuff.	no
4813	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	And uh	no
4814	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Exactly exactly. I think there are enough  incidental meetings for us to - to do this. And if  we can get it set up so it is convenient enough,	no
4815	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	um, then you can just do  spontaneous  meetings as well.	no
4816	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah, I mean that's the thing. It's O_K to g-	no
4817	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right.	no
4818	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Which  I'm  interested in. I mean, that's one of the things, the whole reason I want a P_D_A as opposed to a wired room	no
4819	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4820	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right.	no
4821	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	is for spontaneous meetings.	no
4822	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well, we've got to make it really really easy to start it going then in that case. Cuz that - that's the real  goal.	no
4823	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right.	no
4824	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	That's right.	no
4825	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	That's why I put  ten  on here instead of thirty or forty or fifty.	no
4826	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right. But I mean if we - if we want  Jerry's group to  use it then we probably  @@  won't ask them to read any numbers, right? Cuz.	no
4827	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right. Well, I - I bet they would be willing to do it the first few times, just for the novelty.	no
4828	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4829	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4830	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I think they would.	no
4831	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	And also he's - he's - he's got  at  least  one  woman.	no
4832	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	That's great. I know.	no
4833	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Oh, that's a good  point!	no
4834	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	And we're - we have a little problem of  no women,	no
4835	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Boy, that's abs- I had never - I hadn't even thought about that.	no
4836	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I know, it's a disaster.	no
4837	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah, well, when L- when Liz uh Shriberg starts coming, then there's another woman although she -	no
4838	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Oh, man!	no
4839	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	It's alright she doesn't mind as long as we don't video her, right?	no
4840	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4841	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Ah, that's right. That was it. So.	no
4842	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Maybe we should have the reading group here and force Jane to come.	no
4843	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4844	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah. No, well, actually we could have Jane uh - Jane's interested and curious about this stuff so she could attend one of - probably not the decoder meeting but some of the other stuff she  would be interested enough and have her read -	no
4845	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Mm-hmm.	no
4846	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4847	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	We could - we could have the reading group in here. Yeah.	no
4848	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah, I mean it's a different  style.  But I think that's alright.	no
4849	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4850	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I mean.	no
4851	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah, it's great.	no
4852	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4853	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Um,   we were joking about having lunch up here but eating with the microphones -	no
4854	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Um,  I had another question  briefly  about  transcription.  So  are  we going get an external service or are  we  gonna do it? I mean who's gonna  generate the transcripts?	yes
4855	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Um,  I had another question  briefly  about  transcription.  So  are  we going get an external service or are  we  gonna do it? I mean who's gonna  generate the transcripts?	no
4856	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	O_K.	no
4857	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Um	no
4858	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I think that one of the neat things about having this little  pilot  thing from today	no
4859	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	is we should try it a couple different ways,	no
4860	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Mm-hmm.	no
4861	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	so we should  try to do it internally, maybe ask - ask Jane if we could get her to do it or - or - or have her  supervise a linguistics student or somebody	no
4862	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Mm-hmm	no
4863	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Mm-hmm.	no
4864	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	and uh see how long it takes, and you know, multiply out the cost, and then send -	no
4865	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	send the same thing out, or maybe split it in halves or something - something like that	no
4866	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Mm-hmm.	no
4867	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	to a - to an outside service	no
4868	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	and uh see what  that  costs and how much hassle that is.	no
4869	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right.	no
4870	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	And then we can	no
4871	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah, the - the  problem  of course is that it's  you know, in - in this meeting it's three four five six seven eight, it's  nine  transcripts,  potentially.	no
4872	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	assess it.	no
4873	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well,	no
4874	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Except that you wouldn't transcribe them all individually, right? You would send - I mean,	no
4875	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	No.	no
4876	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	uh a transcriber is used - I mean, I don't know, assume - presumably a transcriber  transcribes a single meeting, right? And so they - they just have to  indicate that the  speaker changes.	no
4877	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	No.	no
4878	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right. This was - this was the point of having near zero skew. Right?	no
4879	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right?	no
4880	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So you just pick one,	no
4881	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	with the best sounding one, and give it to somebody and they transcribe it.	no
4882	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Oh, you're right, yeah, yeah, yeah.	no
4883	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4884	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right.	no
4885	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So  the only thing we'll have to be careful with is that they're -  well,  what  are they  listening  to?	no
4886	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So - so they - they're gonna - they're gonna have to make speaker assignments  or something like this.	no
4887	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	They're going to have to make speaker assignments, and wh- and  which  recording are they gonna  listen  to?	no
4888	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	For one of - one of  @@ .	no
4889	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Or we could mix - we could mix the - the headset mikes, you know, just to make a single	no
4890	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	high q- high quality -	no
4891	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right.	no
4892	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Oh, that would be interesting.	no
4893	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	and we could do -	no
4894	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	and we could do all kinds of weird things like having you know squelch so that  you only, you know - you only - you	no
4895	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	cut it out when there's no energy. So you don't  @@  noise.	no
4896	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Mm-hmm.	no
4897	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah, you could do fancy things, but it seems like that's enough.	no
4898	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4899	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4900	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I mean there's - it's -	no
4901	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	O_K.	no
4902	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	If we - if we do something which is have a little bit of human input to get the words	no
4903	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	then we can  leverage that a lot	no
4904	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	by some  clever cross thing  to figure out which channel they really belong to and stuff like this,	no
4905	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Mm-hmm.	no
4906	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	probably.	no
4907	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yet.	no
4908	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So that - I mean, that's  one  chunk of work and just  segmenting  for  this  is gonna be  another  chunk of work.	no
4909	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Um.	no
4910	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah. And - Yeah. As much work as you want.	no
4911	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah	no
4912	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	But uh I don't know. This meeting,  so,  say it's maybe going to be a half hour or something, and -	no
4913	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4914	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	and uh we've heard estimates ranging between ten and twenty  times uh real time to do this kind of transcription	no
4915	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	um  so you know in - in principle then it'll take somebody a day for somebody to deal with this.	no
4916	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Mm-hmm.  Wow.	no
4917	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4918	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	And uh we'll see  which one of those seems closest to right and if they -	no
4919	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Mm-hmm.	no
4920	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	ramped up, if towards the end it was faster you know, get some sort of sense from them	no
4921	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	uh from whoever does it	no
4922	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	and um then uh	no
4923	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	like I say, check it out with an external service and see  if it's faster, cheaper, better, worse, whatever. Then we'll go from there.	no
4924	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right.	no
4925	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Mm-hmm.	no
4926	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah, one of the things I was thinking with transcript is that if we  take  the near field	no
4927	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	and  we do an initial  recognition pass, is it easier for a transcriber to  correct  a transcript,	no
4928	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	if the  near field mike does a reasonably good job?	no
4929	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Hmm.	no
4930	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I bet it  isn't,	no
4931	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4932	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	unless it's really close to  right.	no
4933	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I have - just because it's such an un-	no
4934	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	The  transcribing  is sort of something I can imagine doing,	no
4935	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right.	no
4936	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	whereas having this distraction	no
4937	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	of having sort of something that  looks  like it might be right but has got some	no
4938	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Some errors, yeah.	no
4939	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	very wrong bits in	no
4940	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	is sort of a less - less easy thing to do.	no
4941	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I don't know. I do- I don't know the answer to that.	no
4942	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I'm sure the professional transcribers obviously don't have any use for -	no
4943	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I don't know.	no
4944	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah	no
4945	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well, I mean there's this Cyber Transcriber service, right?	no
4946	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah, that's true, that's true.	no
4947	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	And at least  supposedly  the way they work is by feeding them	no
4948	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah, by fixing up  transcripts.	no
4949	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	what is  the output of the recognizer.	no
4950	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So maybe it depends on what the software tools are like.	no
4951	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	If it's - you know, if they can easily flip through stuff and get to the right thing, or do you point, or I don't know.	no
4952	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah, but - Yeah.	no
4953	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	There's supposed to be some out - out - out-of-work shepherders or something in  Scotland but -	no
4954	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4955	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Ah, the internet.	no
4956	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	They  should  all be in  India  right now. That's where the good, but the cheap English speakers are.	no
4957	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah.	no
4958	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Inexpensive.	no
4959	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Not in Scotland.	no
4960	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I'm sorry, yeah.	no
4961	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Not in Scotland.	no
4962	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well they don't speak  such clear English	no
4963	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	They - they sheep - they s- they - they speak  cheap  English, right?	no
4964	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	O_K so we're degenerating, right. Are - are - are we done with uh M_R business, or - ?	no
4965	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yep.	no
4966	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Sure.	no
4967	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I mean what- what's - maybe we should - what are our action items? So there's - there's the continuing process of  cleaning up the stuff and making it easier to do that.	yes
4968	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	O_K so we're degenerating, right. Are - are - are we done with uh M_R business, or - ?	no
4969	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Sure.	no
4970	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	I mean what- what's - maybe we should - what are our action items? So there's - there's the continuing process of  cleaning up the stuff and making it easier to do that.	no
4971	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	There's taking  the results of this meeting  and putting it in some kind of decent form, probably getting  some kind of single channel  merged sum data or something so that you can give a simple  sound file of some sort to a transcriber	no
4972	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Mm-hmm.	no
4973	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Mm-hmm.	no
4974	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Mm-hmm.	no
4975	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	to deal with it rather than this massive thing. That's a little bit of  stuff to do. Right?	no
4976	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right.	no
4977	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	And then  do some segmenting and recognition - initial recognition	no
4978	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	would be interesting to do.	no
4979	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah, although it - it - it - it may be separating out these numbers  from the rest. Yeah.	no
4980	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	That's what I mean.	no
4981	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	And then	no
4982	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah just doing a digits on it - uh, connected digits.	no
4983	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Yeah  and uh	no
4984	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Right.	no
4985	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So, with this next -	no
4986	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	You wanna read?	no
4987	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Sure. O_K.	yes
4988	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	So, with this next -	no
4989	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Sure. O_K.	no

5025	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well, let's do some more while we got them here.	no
5026	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Wow.	no
5027	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	O_K.	no
5028	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	What fun  it is.	no
5029	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	Well, you know, it's not, but	no
5030	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	It's interesting that um it m- it's not clear whether it's better to have them written as - as words or - or   figures.	no
5031	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	"But, of course, to get zero and ""O_""s distinguished we - you have to do it."	no
5032	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	That's why, yep.	no
5033	transcript	transcript_Bmr001	But  it's kind of weird to read.	no

5124	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh	no
5125	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Channel - channel three, yeah. O_K.	no
5126	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mmm, channel five?	no
5127	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Channel two.	no
5128	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Doesn't work?	no
5129	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Two.	no
5130	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah,  that's  the  mike  number  there,	no
5131	transcript	transcript_Bro004	uh	no
5132	transcript	transcript_Bro004	No?	no
5133	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Is it written on her  sheet,  I believe.	no
5134	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mike four.	no
5135	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Watch this.   Yep, that's me.	no
5136	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh, mike number five,	no
5137	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Ah,   era el cuatro.   Yeah.	no
5138	transcript	transcript_Bro004	and	no
5139	transcript	transcript_Bro004	But,  channel	no
5140	transcript	transcript_Bro004	channel - channel four.	no
5141	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah yeah yeah.	no
5142	transcript	transcript_Bro004	This is  you.	no
5143	transcript	transcript_Bro004	O_K. I saw that.	no
5144	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Ah - yeah, it's O_K.	no
5145	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5146	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And I'm channel uh  two  I think,  or channel -	no
5147	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Ooo.	no
5148	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I think  I'm  channel two.	no
5149	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Oh, I'm channel - must be channel one. Channel one?  Yes, O_K.	no
5150	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Channel -	no
5151	transcript	transcript_Bro004	O_K. So uh	yes
5152	transcript	transcript_Bro004	O_K. So uh	no
5153	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I also copied uh the results that we all got in the mail I think from uh -	no
5154	transcript	transcript_Bro004	from O_G_I and we'll go - go through them also.	no
5155	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So where are we on -	no
5156	transcript	transcript_Bro004	on uh	no
5157	transcript	transcript_Bro004	our runs?	no
5158	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh so.  uh - We - So  As I was already said, we - we mainly focused on	yes
5159	transcript	transcript_Bro004	our runs?	no
5160	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh so.  uh - We - So  As I was already said, we - we mainly focused on	no
5161	transcript	transcript_Bro004	uh four kind of features. The P_L_P, the P_L_P with J_RASTA, the M_S_G, and the M_F_C_C from the baseline Aurora.	no
5162	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Excuse me.	no
5163	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I decided to talk about that.	no
5164	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
5165	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh, and we focused for the - the test part on the English and the Italian.	no
5166	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Um. We've trained uh several neural networks on - so - on the T_I-digits English  and on the Italian data and also on the broad uh  English uh French and uh Spanish databases.	no
5167	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mmm, so there's our result tables here, for the tandem approach, and um, actually what we - we  @@  observed is that if the network is trained on the task data it works pretty well.	no
5168	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I can't get  back  far enough.	no
5169	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Chicken on the grill.	no
5170	transcript	transcript_Bro004	O_K. Our - our uh -	no
5171	transcript	transcript_Bro004	There's a -  We're pausing for a photo -	no
5172	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Sorry, guys.	no
5173	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Try  that  corner.	no
5174	transcript	transcript_Bro004	How about over th- from the front of the room?	no
5175	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah, it's longer.	no
5176	transcript	transcript_Bro004	We're pausing for a photo opportunity here. Uh.	no
5177	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh.	no
5178	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So.	no
5179	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Oh wait wait wait wait wait. Wait. Hold on. Hold on. Let me give you a black screen.	no
5180	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Get out of the - Yeah.	no
5181	transcript	transcript_Bro004	O_K.	no
5182	transcript	transcript_Bro004	One more.	no
5183	transcript	transcript_Bro004	He's facing  this  way.	no
5184	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Because we  said  we were gonna  do  this and I  just  remembered.	no
5185	transcript	transcript_Bro004	What?	no
5186	transcript	transcript_Bro004	O_K, this - this would be a  good section for our silence detection.	no
5187	transcript	transcript_Bro004	O_K.	no
5188	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Um	no
5189	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
5190	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Musical chairs everybody!	no
5191	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Oh.	no
5192	transcript	transcript_Bro004	O_K.	no
5193	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So um,	no
5194	transcript	transcript_Bro004	you were saying	no
5195	transcript	transcript_Bro004	about the training data -	no
5196	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah, so if the network is trained on the task data um  tandem works pretty well. And uh actually we have uh, results are similar	no
5197	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5198	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Do you mean if it's trained  only  on -	no
5199	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Only on, yeah.	no
5200	transcript	transcript_Bro004	On data from just that task, that language?	no
5201	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Just that task.	no
5202	transcript	transcript_Bro004	But actually we didn't train network on  uh both types of data I mean	no
5203	transcript	transcript_Bro004	uh  phonetically ba- phonetically balanced uh data and task data.	no
5204	transcript	transcript_Bro004	We only did  either  task - task data or  uh broad  data.	no
5205	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mmm.	no
5206	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
5207	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Um	no
5208	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah. So,	no
5209	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So how - I mean -	no
5210	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So what's th-	no
5211	transcript	transcript_Bro004	clearly it's gonna be  good  then but the question is how much  worse is it	no
5212	transcript	transcript_Bro004	if you have  broad  data?	no
5213	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I mean,	no
5214	transcript	transcript_Bro004	my assump-	no
5215	transcript	transcript_Bro004	From what I saw from the earlier results, uh I guess last week,	no
5216	transcript	transcript_Bro004	was that um,	no
5217	transcript	transcript_Bro004	if you   trained  on one language and  tested  on another, say, that	no
5218	transcript	transcript_Bro004	the results were - were relatively  poor.	no
5219	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mmm. Yeah.	no
5220	transcript	transcript_Bro004	But - but the question is if you  train  on one language	no
5221	transcript	transcript_Bro004	but you have a  broad  coverage	no
5222	transcript	transcript_Bro004	and then test in another,	no
5223	transcript	transcript_Bro004	does that -  is that  improve  things	no
5224	transcript	transcript_Bro004	i- c- in  comparison?	no
5225	transcript	transcript_Bro004	If we use the same language?	no
5226	transcript	transcript_Bro004	No, no, no.	no
5227	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Different lang-	no
5228	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So	no
5229	transcript	transcript_Bro004	um	no
5230	transcript	transcript_Bro004	If you train on T_I-digits  and test on  Italian  digits,  you do poorly,	no
5231	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
5232	transcript	transcript_Bro004	let's say.	no
5233	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I don't have the  numbers  in front of me, so I'm just  imagining.	no
5234	transcript	transcript_Bro004	But -	no
5235	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah but I did not uh do that. We -	no
5236	transcript	transcript_Bro004	E-	no
5237	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So, you didn't train on  TIMIT and test on -  on Italian digits, say?	no
5238	transcript	transcript_Bro004	No, we did four - four kind of - of testing, actually.	no
5239	transcript	transcript_Bro004	The first testing is  with task data -	no
5240	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So, with nets trained on task data.	no
5241	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So for Italian on the Italian speech  @@ .	no
5242	transcript	transcript_Bro004	The second test is trained on a single language	no
5243	transcript	transcript_Bro004	um with broad  database,  but the same language as the t- task data.	no
5244	transcript	transcript_Bro004	O_K.	no
5245	transcript	transcript_Bro004	But for Italian we choose Spanish which  we assume is close to Italian.	no
5246	transcript	transcript_Bro004	The third test is by using, um	no
5247	transcript	transcript_Bro004	the three language database	no
5248	transcript	transcript_Bro004	and the fourth is	no
5249	transcript	transcript_Bro004	W- which in - It has three languages. That's including the w-	no
5250	transcript	transcript_Bro004	the -	no
5251	transcript	transcript_Bro004	the -	no
5252	transcript	transcript_Bro004	This includes -	no
5253	transcript	transcript_Bro004	the one that it's -	no
5254	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5255	transcript	transcript_Bro004	But  not	no
5256	transcript	transcript_Bro004	In-	no
5257	transcript	transcript_Bro004	digits.  I mean it's -	no
5258	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Right.	no
5259	transcript	transcript_Bro004	The three languages	no
5260	transcript	transcript_Bro004	is  not  digits, it's the broad	no
5261	transcript	transcript_Bro004	data. O_K.	no
5262	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah	no
5263	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And the fourth test is uh  excluding from these three languages the language  that is  the task language.	no
5264	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Oh, O_K, yeah, so, that  is  what I wanted to know.	no
5265	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5266	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I just wasn't  saying  it very well, I guess.	no
5267	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh, yeah.	no
5268	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So um  for uh T_I-digits for ins- example  uh when we go from T_I-digits training to  TIMIT training  uh we lose  uh around ten percent, uh.	no
5269	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Relative.	no
5270	transcript	transcript_Bro004	The error rate increase u- of - of -	no
5271	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Right.	no
5272	transcript	transcript_Bro004	of ten percent, relative.	no
5273	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So this is not so bad. And then when we jump to the multilingual data it's uh it become worse and, well	no
5274	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Ab- about how much?	no
5275	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Around uh, let's say,  twenty perc- twenty percent further.  So.  Yeah.	no
5276	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Twenty percent  further?	no
5277	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Twenty to - to thirty percent further. Yeah.	no
5278	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And so, remind me, the  multilingual  stuff is  just  the broad data. Right?	no
5279	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5280	transcript	transcript_Bro004	It's not the digits. So it's the combination of  two things there.	no
5281	transcript	transcript_Bro004	It's  removing the  task specific  training and  it's adding other languages.	no
5282	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5283	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5284	transcript	transcript_Bro004	O_K.	no
5285	transcript	transcript_Bro004	But the first step is al- already removing the task s- specific from - from -	no
5286	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Already, right right right.	no
5287	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So. And we lose -	no
5288	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So they were sort of  building   here? O_K?	no
5289	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5290	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh  So, basically when it's  trained  on the - the multilingual broad data	no
5291	transcript	transcript_Bro004	um or number - so, the - the  ratio of our error rates uh with the  baseline error rate is around  uh one point one.	no
5292	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So.	no
5293	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yes.	no
5294	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And it's something like one point  three  of - of the	no
5295	transcript	transcript_Bro004	uh -	no
5296	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I- i- if you compare everything to the first case at the baseline,	no
5297	transcript	transcript_Bro004	you get something like one point one	no
5298	transcript	transcript_Bro004	for the - for the using the same language but a different task, and something like one point three	no
5299	transcript	transcript_Bro004	for three - three languages	no
5300	transcript	transcript_Bro004	No no no.	no
5301	transcript	transcript_Bro004	broad  stuff.	no
5302	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh same language we are at uh - for at English at O_ point eight.	no
5303	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So it improves,	no
5304	transcript	transcript_Bro004	compared to the baseline.	no
5305	transcript	transcript_Bro004	But -	no
5306	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So. Le-  let  me.	no
5307	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I - I - I'm sorry. I - I - I meant something different by baseline	no
5308	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Tas- task data we are u-	no
5309	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5310	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So let me - let me -	no
5311	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Um,  so,  um -	no
5312	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mmm.	no
5313	transcript	transcript_Bro004	O_K, fine. Let's - let's use the conventional meaning of baseline. I - I -	no
5314	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Hmm.	no
5315	transcript	transcript_Bro004	By baseline here I meant	no
5316	transcript	transcript_Bro004	uh using the task specific data.	no
5317	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Oh yeah, the f-	no
5318	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah, O_K. Yeah.	no
5319	transcript	transcript_Bro004	But uh -	no
5320	transcript	transcript_Bro004	uh, because that's what you were just doing with this ten percent.	no
5321	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So I was just - I just trying to understand  that.  So if we call	no
5322	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah. Sure.	no
5323	transcript	transcript_Bro004	a factor of w- just  one,	no
5324	transcript	transcript_Bro004	just normalized to  one,  the word error rate	no
5325	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mmm.	no
5326	transcript	transcript_Bro004	that you have  for using T_I-digits as - as	no
5327	transcript	transcript_Bro004	training  and T_I-digits as  test,	no
5328	transcript	transcript_Bro004	uh different  words,  I'm sure, but -	no
5329	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
5330	transcript	transcript_Bro004	but uh, uh the same  task and so on.	no
5331	transcript	transcript_Bro004	"If we call that ""one"",  then what you're saying is"	no
5332	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
5333	transcript	transcript_Bro004	that the word error rate  for the same language but using  uh  different  training data than you're testing on, say TIMIT and so forth,	no
5334	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
5335	transcript	transcript_Bro004	it's one point one.	no
5336	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah, it's around one point one. Yeah.	no
5337	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Right.	no
5338	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And if it's -	no
5339	transcript	transcript_Bro004	you  do  go to	no
5340	transcript	transcript_Bro004	three languages  including  the English,	no
5341	transcript	transcript_Bro004	it's something like one point  three.	no
5342	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Ye-	no
5343	transcript	transcript_Bro004	That's  what you were just  saying,  I think.	no
5344	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh,  more  actually. If I -	no
5345	transcript	transcript_Bro004	One point four?	no
5346	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5347	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So, it's an  additional  thirty percent.	no
5348	transcript	transcript_Bro004	What would you say?  Around one point four yeah.	no
5349	transcript	transcript_Bro004	O_K.	no
5350	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And if you  exclude   English,	no
5351	transcript	transcript_Bro004	from this combination, what's  that?	no
5352	transcript	transcript_Bro004	If we  exclude   English,   um  there is  not much difference with the  data  with  English.	no
5353	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Aha!	no
5354	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So.	no
5355	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5356	transcript	transcript_Bro004	That's  interesting.	no
5357	transcript	transcript_Bro004	That's interesting.	no
5358	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Do you see? Because -	no
5359	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh.	no
5360	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh, so -	no
5361	transcript	transcript_Bro004	"No, that - that's important. So what - what it's saying here is just that ""yes, there is a reduction"	no
5362	transcript	transcript_Bro004	in performance,	no
5363	transcript	transcript_Bro004	when you don't  um	no
5364	transcript	transcript_Bro004	have the s-	no
5365	transcript	transcript_Bro004	when you don't have  um	no
5366	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Task  data.	no
5367	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Wait a minute, th- th- the -	no
5368	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Hmm.	no
5369	transcript	transcript_Bro004	No, actually  it's  interesting.  So it's -	no
5370	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So when you go to a different  task,  there's actually not so  different. It's when you went to these -	no
5371	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So what's the difference between two and three?	no
5372	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Between the one point one case and the one point four case? I'm confused.	no
5373	transcript	transcript_Bro004	It's multilingual.	no
5374	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah. The only difference it's - is that it's multilingual -	no
5375	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Um  Yeah.	no
5376	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Cuz in both - in both -  both  of those cases, you don't have the same  task.	no
5377	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah sure.	no
5378	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So is - is the training data for the - for this one point four case -	no
5379	transcript	transcript_Bro004	does it  include  the training data for the one point one case?	no
5380	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh yeah.	no
5381	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah, a fraction of it.	no
5382	transcript	transcript_Bro004	A part of it, yeah.	no
5383	transcript	transcript_Bro004	How m- how much bigger is it?	no
5384	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Um	no
5385	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah, um.	no
5386	transcript	transcript_Bro004	It's two times, actually? Yeah.	no
5387	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Um.	no
5388	transcript	transcript_Bro004	The  English  data -	no
5389	transcript	transcript_Bro004	No, the  multilingual  databases are two times the  broad English  data.	no
5390	transcript	transcript_Bro004	We just wanted to keep this, w- well, not too  huge.  So.	no
5391	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So it's  two  times,	no
5392	transcript	transcript_Bro004	but it  includes  the - but it  includes  the broad English data.	no
5393	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I think so.  Do you  -	no
5394	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh,	no
5395	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5396	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And the broad English data is what you got this one point one  with. So that's TIMIT basically right?	no
5397	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
5398	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5399	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So it's band-limited TIMIT.	no
5400	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
5401	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
5402	transcript	transcript_Bro004	This is all	no
5403	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5404	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Downs-	no
5405	transcript	transcript_Bro004	eight kilohertz sampling.	no
5406	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Right.	no
5407	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So you have band-limited TIMIT,  gave you uh	no
5408	transcript	transcript_Bro004	almost  as good as a result as using T_I- digits	no
5409	transcript	transcript_Bro004	on a T_I-digits  test.	no
5410	transcript	transcript_Bro004	O_K?	no
5411	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Hmm?	no
5412	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Um  and  um	no
5413	transcript	transcript_Bro004	But,	no
5414	transcript	transcript_Bro004	when you add in more training data but keep the neural net the same size,	no
5415	transcript	transcript_Bro004	it  um performs worse on the T_I-digits.	no
5416	transcript	transcript_Bro004	O_K, now all of this is -	no
5417	transcript	transcript_Bro004	This is  noisy   T_I-digits, I assume?	no
5418	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yep.	no
5419	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Both training and test?	no
5420	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.  O_K.	no
5421	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Um	no
5422	transcript	transcript_Bro004	O_K.	no
5423	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Well.	no
5424	transcript	transcript_Bro004	We - we - we may just need to uh -	no
5425	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So I mean it's interesting that h- going to a different -	no
5426	transcript	transcript_Bro004	different  task  didn't seem to  hurt  us that much, and going to a different  language	no
5427	transcript	transcript_Bro004	um	no
5428	transcript	transcript_Bro004	It doesn't seem to matter -	no
5429	transcript	transcript_Bro004	The difference between  three  and  four  is not particularly great, so that means that	no
5430	transcript	transcript_Bro004	whether you have the  language  in or  not  is not such a big deal.	no
5431	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mmm.	no
5432	transcript	transcript_Bro004	It sounds like um	no
5433	transcript	transcript_Bro004	uh	no
5434	transcript	transcript_Bro004	we  may  need to have more	no
5435	transcript	transcript_Bro004	of uh things that are similar to a target language or - I mean.	no
5436	transcript	transcript_Bro004	You have the  same  number of parameters in the  neural  net, you haven't increased the size of the neural net,	no
5437	transcript	transcript_Bro004	and maybe there's just -	no
5438	transcript	transcript_Bro004	just not enough	no
5439	transcript	transcript_Bro004	complexity to it to represent	no
5440	transcript	transcript_Bro004	the variab- increased variability in the -	no
5441	transcript	transcript_Bro004	in the training set.	no
5442	transcript	transcript_Bro004	That - that could be.	no
5443	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Um	no
5444	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So, what about -	no
5445	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So  these  are results with	no
5446	transcript	transcript_Bro004	uh th-	no
5447	transcript	transcript_Bro004	that you're describing now, that	no
5448	transcript	transcript_Bro004	they are pretty similar for the different features or -	no
5449	transcript	transcript_Bro004	or uh -	no
5450	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh, let me check. Uh.	no
5451	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So. This was for the P_L_P,	no
5452	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5453	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Um. The - Yeah. For the P_L_P with J_RASTA the -	no
5454	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5455	transcript	transcript_Bro004	the - we -	no
5456	transcript	transcript_Bro004	This is quite the same  tendency,	no
5457	transcript	transcript_Bro004	with a slight increase of the error rate,	no
5458	transcript	transcript_Bro004	uh if we go to - to TIMIT.	no
5459	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And then it's - it gets worse with the multilingual.	no
5460	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Um.	no
5461	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah. There - there is a difference actually with - b- between P_L_P and J_RASTA is that	no
5462	transcript	transcript_Bro004	J_RASTA  seems to  perform better with the highly mismatched  condition	no
5463	transcript	transcript_Bro004	but  slightly   - slightly worse  for the well matched condition.	no
5464	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mmm.	no
5465	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I have a suggestion, actually, even though it'll delay us slightly, would - would you mind	no
5466	transcript	transcript_Bro004	running into the other room and making	no
5467	transcript	transcript_Bro004	copies of this?  Cuz we're all sort of -	no
5468	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah, yeah.	no
5469	transcript	transcript_Bro004	If we c- if we could look at it, while we're talking, I think  it 'd be uh -	no
5470	transcript	transcript_Bro004	O_K.	no
5471	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh, I'll - I'll sing a song or dance or something while you  do it, too.	no
5472	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Alright.	no
5473	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So um - Go ahead. Ah, while you're gone I'll ask s- some of my questions.	no
5474	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5475	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Um.	no
5476	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5477	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh,	no
5478	transcript	transcript_Bro004	this way and just slightly to the left, yeah.	no
5479	transcript	transcript_Bro004	The um -	no
5480	transcript	transcript_Bro004	What was - Was this number  forty or - It was roughly the same as this one,  he said?  When you had the  two  language versus the  three  language?	no
5481	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Um.	no
5482	transcript	transcript_Bro004	That's what he was  saying.	no
5483	transcript	transcript_Bro004	That's where he removed English, right?	no
5484	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5485	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Right.	no
5486	transcript	transcript_Bro004	It sometimes, actually, depends on what features you're using.	no
5487	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5488	transcript	transcript_Bro004	But - but i- it sounds like -	no
5489	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Um, but -	no
5490	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I mean.  That's  interesting because	no
5491	transcript	transcript_Bro004	it - it  seems  like what it's saying is  not  so much that you got  hurt	no
5492	transcript	transcript_Bro004	uh because  you	no
5493	transcript	transcript_Bro004	uh didn't have so much representation of  English,	no
5494	transcript	transcript_Bro004	because in the  other  case you don't get hurt  any   more,   at least when	no
5495	transcript	transcript_Bro004	it seemed like uh it - it might simply be a case that you  have  something that is just much more  diverse,	no
5496	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
5497	transcript	transcript_Bro004	but you have the same number of parameters  representing  it.	no
5498	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.  I wonder - were um all three of these nets  using the same output? This  multi-language    uh labeling?	no
5499	transcript	transcript_Bro004	He -	no
5500	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
5501	transcript	transcript_Bro004	He was using uh sixty-four phonemes from  SAMPA.	no
5502	transcript	transcript_Bro004	O_K, O_K.	no
5503	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5504	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So  this  would -	no
5505	transcript	transcript_Bro004	"From  this  you would say, ""well, it doesn't really  matter  if we put Finnish"	no
5506	transcript	transcript_Bro004	into  the training of the neural net,	no
5507	transcript	transcript_Bro004	if there's  gonna be,	no
5508	transcript	transcript_Bro004	"you know, Finnish in the test data."" Right?"	no
5509	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Well, it's - it sounds -	no
5510	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I mean, we have to be  careful,  cuz we haven't gotten a  good  result yet.	no
5511	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5512	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And comparing different  bad  results can be  tricky.	no
5513	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Hmm.	no
5514	transcript	transcript_Bro004	But I - I - I -	no
5515	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I think it  does  suggest that it's not so much uh	no
5516	transcript	transcript_Bro004	uh cross   language  as cross  type  of  speech.	no
5517	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
5518	transcript	transcript_Bro004	It's - it's um -	no
5519	transcript	transcript_Bro004	But we  did  - Oh yeah, the other thing I was  asking  him, though, is that I  think  that in the case -	no
5520	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah, you - you  do  have to be careful because of com- compounded results. I think we got some earlier results	no
5521	transcript	transcript_Bro004	in which you  trained  on one language and  tested  on  another  and you didn't have	no
5522	transcript	transcript_Bro004	three,  but you just had  one   language. So you trained on	no
5523	transcript	transcript_Bro004	one type of digits and  tested  on  another.  Didn-	no
5524	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Wasn't there something of that? Where you,	no
5525	transcript	transcript_Bro004	say, trained on Spanish and tested on - on T_I-digits, or the other way around?	no
5526	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Something like that?	no
5527	transcript	transcript_Bro004	No.	no
5528	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I thought there was  something  like that,	no
5529	transcript	transcript_Bro004	that he showed me  last week.	no
5530	transcript	transcript_Bro004	We'll have to wait till we get -	no
5531	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah, that would be interesting.	no
5532	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Um,	no
5533	transcript	transcript_Bro004	This  may  have been what I was asking before, Stephane, but -	no
5534	transcript	transcript_Bro004	but, um, wasn't there  something  that you did,	no
5535	transcript	transcript_Bro004	where you  trained   on  one  language and  tested  on  another?	no
5536	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I mean no - no  mixture  but just -	no
5537	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I'll get it for you.	no
5538	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh, no, no.	no
5539	transcript	transcript_Bro004	We've never just trained on one lang-	no
5540	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Training on a  single  language, you mean, and  testing  on the  other  one?	no
5541	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5542	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Not yet.	no
5543	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh, no.	no
5544	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So the only  task that's similar to this is the training on  two  languages, and	no
5545	transcript	transcript_Bro004	But we've  done  a bunch of things where we just trained on one  language.  Right?	no
5546	transcript	transcript_Bro004	that -	no
5547	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I mean, you haven't - you haven't done  all  your tests on multiple  languages.	no
5548	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh,	no
5549	transcript	transcript_Bro004	No.	no
5550	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Either thi- this is test with  uh the  same  language  but from the  broad  data, or it's test with  uh  different  languages	no
5551	transcript	transcript_Bro004	also  from the broad data,  excluding  the -	no
5552	transcript	transcript_Bro004	The  early  experiment that -	no
5553	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So, it's - it's three or - three and four.	no
5554	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Did you do different languages from digits?	no
5555	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh. No.	no
5556	transcript	transcript_Bro004	You mean	no
5557	transcript	transcript_Bro004	training digits	no
5558	transcript	transcript_Bro004	on one language and using the net	no
5559	transcript	transcript_Bro004	to recognize on the other?	no
5560	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Digits on another language?	no
5561	transcript	transcript_Bro004	No.	no
5562	transcript	transcript_Bro004	See, I  thought  you  showed  me something like that last  week.	no
5563	transcript	transcript_Bro004	You had a - you had a little -	no
5564	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh,	no
5565	transcript	transcript_Bro004	No, I don't  think  so.	no
5566	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Um	no
5567	transcript	transcript_Bro004	What -	no
5568	transcript	transcript_Bro004	These numbers are uh	no
5569	transcript	transcript_Bro004	ratio to baseline?	no
5570	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So, I mean wha- what's the - This - this chart - this table that we're looking at  is um,	no
5571	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So.	no
5572	transcript	transcript_Bro004	show- is all  testing  for  T_I -digits, or - ?	no
5573	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Bigger is worse.  This is error rate, I think.	no
5574	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So you have uh basically two  uh parts. The upper part is for T_I-digits	no
5575	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Ratio.	no
5576	transcript	transcript_Bro004	No.  No.	no
5577	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah, yeah, yeah.	no
5578	transcript	transcript_Bro004	and it's divided in three  rows  of four - four rows each.	no
5579	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
5580	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5581	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And the first four rows is well-matched, then the s- the second group of four rows is mismatched, and	no
5582	transcript	transcript_Bro004	finally highly mismatched.	no
5583	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And then the lower part is for Italian and it's the same -	no
5584	transcript	transcript_Bro004	the same thing.	no
5585	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So, so the upper part is  training   T_I-digits?	no
5586	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So.	no
5587	transcript	transcript_Bro004	It's - it's the H_T_K results, I mean. So it's	no
5588	transcript	transcript_Bro004	H_T_K training testings	no
5589	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Ah.	no
5590	transcript	transcript_Bro004	with different kind of features	no
5591	transcript	transcript_Bro004	and what appears in the	no
5592	transcript	transcript_Bro004	uh left column is  the networks that are used for doing this.	no
5593	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Hmm.	no
5594	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So.	no
5595	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh	no
5596	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5597	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Well,	no
5598	transcript	transcript_Bro004	What was is that i-	no
5599	transcript	transcript_Bro004	What was it that you had	no
5600	transcript	transcript_Bro004	done  last week when you showed - Do you remember?	no
5601	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Wh- when you showed me  the - your table last week?	no
5602	transcript	transcript_Bro004	It- It was part of these results.	no
5603	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mmm.	no
5604	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mmm.	no
5605	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So where is the baseline  for the T_I-digits  located in here?	no
5606	transcript	transcript_Bro004	You mean the H_T_K Aurora baseline?	no
5607	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5608	transcript	transcript_Bro004	It's uh the one hundred number.	no
5609	transcript	transcript_Bro004	It's, well, all these numbers are the ratio	no
5610	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Ah!	no
5611	transcript	transcript_Bro004	with respect to the baseline.	no
5612	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Ah, O_K, O_K.	no
5613	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So this is word - word error rate, so a  high  number is  bad.	no
5614	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah, this is  a word error rate ratio.	no
5615	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5616	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5617	transcript	transcript_Bro004	O_K, I see.	no
5618	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So,	no
5619	transcript	transcript_Bro004	seventy point two means that	no
5620	transcript	transcript_Bro004	we reduced the error rate uh by thirty - thirty percent. So.	no
5621	transcript	transcript_Bro004	O_K, O_K, gotcha.	no
5622	transcript	transcript_Bro004	O_K,	no
5623	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Hmm.	no
5624	transcript	transcript_Bro004	so if we take uh	no
5625	transcript	transcript_Bro004	um	no
5626	transcript	transcript_Bro004	let's see	no
5627	transcript	transcript_Bro004	P_L_P	no
5628	transcript	transcript_Bro004	uh with on-line  normalization and  delta-del- so that's this thing you have circled here	no
5629	transcript	transcript_Bro004	in the second column,	no
5630	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5631	transcript	transcript_Bro004	um	no
5632	transcript	transcript_Bro004	"and ""multi-English"" refers to what?"	no
5633	transcript	transcript_Bro004	To TIMIT.	no
5634	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mmm.	no
5635	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Then you have  uh M_F,  M_S and M_E which are for French, Spanish and English.	no
5636	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And,  yeah.	no
5637	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Actually I -  I uh forgot to say that  the multilingual net are trained	no
5638	transcript	transcript_Bro004	on  uh  features without the s- derivatives	no
5639	transcript	transcript_Bro004	uh but with  increased frame numbers. Mmm.	no
5640	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And we can - we can see on the first line of the table that it - it -	no
5641	transcript	transcript_Bro004	it's  slightly   - slightly worse when we don't use delta but it's not -	no
5642	transcript	transcript_Bro004	not  that  much.	no
5643	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Right.	no
5644	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So w- w-	no
5645	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So, I'm sorry. I missed that. What's M_F, M_S and M_E?	no
5646	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Multi-French, Multi-Spanish	no
5647	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So. Multi-French, Multi-Spanish, and Multi-English.	no
5648	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh O_K. So, it's  uh   broader  vocabulary.	no
5649	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5650	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Then -	no
5651	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And -	no
5652	transcript	transcript_Bro004	O_K so I  think  what I'm -	no
5653	transcript	transcript_Bro004	what I saw in your smaller chart that I was thinking of was -	no
5654	transcript	transcript_Bro004	was	no
5655	transcript	transcript_Bro004	there were  some  numbers I saw, I think, that  included  these multiple languages	no
5656	transcript	transcript_Bro004	and it -	no
5657	transcript	transcript_Bro004	and I was seeing	no
5658	transcript	transcript_Bro004	that it got  worse.	no
5659	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I - I think that was all it was. You had some very limited results that - at that point	no
5660	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5661	transcript	transcript_Bro004	which showed  having in these - these other languages. In fact it might have been just this last category,	no
5662	transcript	transcript_Bro004	having two languages broad	no
5663	transcript	transcript_Bro004	that were -	no
5664	transcript	transcript_Bro004	where - where English was  removed.	no
5665	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So that was cross language	no
5666	transcript	transcript_Bro004	and the - and the result was quite  poor.	no
5667	transcript	transcript_Bro004	What I -	no
5668	transcript	transcript_Bro004	we  hadn't  seen yet was that if you added  in  the English, it's  still  poor.	no
5669	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.  Still poor.	no
5670	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh	no
5671	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Um now, what's the noise condition	no
5672	transcript	transcript_Bro004	um  of the training data -	no
5673	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Well, I think this is what you were explaining. The  noise  condition is the same -	no
5674	transcript	transcript_Bro004	It's the same uh Aurora noises	no
5675	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5676	transcript	transcript_Bro004	uh, in all these cases	no
5677	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5678	transcript	transcript_Bro004	for the training.	no
5679	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So there's not a  statistical - sta- a strong st-	no
5680	transcript	transcript_Bro004	statistically different	no
5681	transcript	transcript_Bro004	noise characteristic between	no
5682	transcript	transcript_Bro004	No these are the s- s- s- same noises, yeah.	no
5683	transcript	transcript_Bro004	uh the training and test	no
5684	transcript	transcript_Bro004	and yet we're seeing  some  kind of effect -	no
5685	transcript	transcript_Bro004	At least - at least for the first -	no
5686	transcript	transcript_Bro004	for the well-matched, yeah.	no
5687	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Well matched condition.	no
5688	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Right.	no
5689	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So there's  some  kind of a - a - an effect from having these - uh this broader coverage	no
5690	transcript	transcript_Bro004	um	no
5691	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Now I  guess  what we should try doing with this is try	no
5692	transcript	transcript_Bro004	testing these on u- this same sort of thing on -	no
5693	transcript	transcript_Bro004	you probably  must  have this	no
5694	transcript	transcript_Bro004	lined  up to  do.  To try the same t-	no
5695	transcript	transcript_Bro004	with the  exact  same  training,  do testing on	no
5696	transcript	transcript_Bro004	the other  languages.	no
5697	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mmm.	no
5698	transcript	transcript_Bro004	On - on um -	no
5699	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So.	no
5700	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Um, oh I well,  wait  a minute. You  have  this  here,  for the  Italian.   That's  right.  O_K, so,	no
5701	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5702	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah, so for the Italian the results are  uh  stranger um	no
5703	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So.	no
5704	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mmm.	no
5705	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So what appears is that perhaps Spanish is	no
5706	transcript	transcript_Bro004	not very close to Italian	no
5707	transcript	transcript_Bro004	because uh, well,	no
5708	transcript	transcript_Bro004	when using the - the network trained only on Spanish it's -	no
5709	transcript	transcript_Bro004	the error rate is	no
5710	transcript	transcript_Bro004	almost uh twice	no
5711	transcript	transcript_Bro004	the baseline error rate.	no
5712	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
5713	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mmm.  Uh.	no
5714	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Well, I mean, let's see.	no
5715	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Is there any difference in -	no
5716	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So it's in  the uh -	no
5717	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So you're saying that	no
5718	transcript	transcript_Bro004	when you  train  on English	no
5719	transcript	transcript_Bro004	and  uh  and - and  test  on -	no
5720	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5721	transcript	transcript_Bro004	No, you  don't  have training on English testing -	no
5722	transcript	transcript_Bro004	There - there is -  another  difference, is that the noise - the noises are different. Well,	no
5723	transcript	transcript_Bro004	In - in  what?	no
5724	transcript	transcript_Bro004	For - for the Italian part I mean the	no
5725	transcript	transcript_Bro004	uh  the um	no
5726	transcript	transcript_Bro004	networks are trained with noise from  Aurora - T_I- digits,  mmm.	no
5727	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Aurora-two.	no
5728	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5729	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And the noise is different  in th-	no
5730	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And perhaps the noise are	no
5731	transcript	transcript_Bro004	quite different from the noises  in the speech that  Italian .	no
5732	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And -	no
5733	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Do we have any um	no
5734	transcript	transcript_Bro004	test sets	no
5735	transcript	transcript_Bro004	uh in  any other language that um	no
5736	transcript	transcript_Bro004	have the  same  noise as in  the Aurora?	no
5737	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mmm, no.	no
5738	transcript	transcript_Bro004	No.	no
5739	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Can I ask something real quick?	no
5740	transcript	transcript_Bro004	In - in the  upper  part -	no
5741	transcript	transcript_Bro004	in the  English   stuff,	no
5742	transcript	transcript_Bro004	it  looks  like the  very   best  number is sixty point nine?	no
5743	transcript	transcript_Bro004	and that's in the uh -	no
5744	transcript	transcript_Bro004	the third  section in the upper part under P_L_P J_RASTA,	no
5745	transcript	transcript_Bro004	sort of the middle column?	no
5746	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5747	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I- is  that   a  noisy  condition?	no
5748	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5749	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So that's  matched  training? Is  that  what that  is?	no
5750	transcript	transcript_Bro004	It's - no, the third part, so it's uh  highly mismatched.	no
5751	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So. Training and  test noise are different.	no
5752	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So - why do you get your  best   number	no
5753	transcript	transcript_Bro004	in -	no
5754	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Wouldn't you get your  best  number in the  clean  case?	no
5755	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Well, it's relative to the	no
5756	transcript	transcript_Bro004	um	no
5757	transcript	transcript_Bro004	baseline mismatching	no
5758	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5759	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Ah, O_K so these are not -	no
5760	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5761	transcript	transcript_Bro004	O_K,  alright, I see.	no
5762	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5763	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5764	transcript	transcript_Bro004	O_K.	no
5765	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And then - so, in the - in the um -	no
5766	transcript	transcript_Bro004	in the   non-mismatched   clean  case,	no
5767	transcript	transcript_Bro004	your best one was under M_F_C_C?	no
5768	transcript	transcript_Bro004	That sixty-one point four?	no
5769	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.  But it's not a  clean  case. It's  a noisy case but	no
5770	transcript	transcript_Bro004	uh training and test noises are the same.	no
5771	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Oh! So this upper third?	no
5772	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So - Yeah.	no
5773	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh that's still noisy?	no
5774	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5775	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Ah, O_K.	no
5776	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So it's always noisy basically,  and,  well, the -	no
5777	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
5778	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I see.	no
5779	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mmm.	no
5780	transcript	transcript_Bro004	O_K?	no
5781	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Um	no
5782	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So uh, I think this will take some  looking at, thinking about. But,	no
5783	transcript	transcript_Bro004	what is uh -	no
5784	transcript	transcript_Bro004	what is  currently  running, that's -	no
5785	transcript	transcript_Bro004	uh, i- that -	no
5786	transcript	transcript_Bro004	just filling in the holes here or - or - ?	no
5787	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh, no we don't plan to fill the holes but	no
5788	transcript	transcript_Bro004	pretty much?	no
5789	transcript	transcript_Bro004	O_K.	no
5790	transcript	transcript_Bro004	actually there is something important,	no
5791	transcript	transcript_Bro004	is that  um we made a lot of assumption concerning the on-line normalization	no
5792	transcript	transcript_Bro004	and we just noticed	no
5793	transcript	transcript_Bro004	uh recently that	no
5794	transcript	transcript_Bro004	uh the  approach that we were using	no
5795	transcript	transcript_Bro004	was not  uh	no
5796	transcript	transcript_Bro004	leading to very good results	no
5797	transcript	transcript_Bro004	when we  used the straight features to H_T_K.	no
5798	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Um	no
5799	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mmm. So basically d-	no
5800	transcript	transcript_Bro004	if you look at the - at the left of the table,	no
5801	transcript	transcript_Bro004	the first uh row,	no
5802	transcript	transcript_Bro004	with eighty-six, one hundred, and forty-three and seventy-five,	no
5803	transcript	transcript_Bro004	these are the results we obtained for Italian	no
5804	transcript	transcript_Bro004	uh with  straight  mmm, P_L_P features	no
5805	transcript	transcript_Bro004	using on-line normalization.	no
5806	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
5807	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mmm.	no
5808	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And the, mmm - what's  in the table, just  at the left of the P_L_P twelve  on-line normalization column,	no
5809	transcript	transcript_Bro004	so, the numbers seventy-nine, fifty-four and  uh forty-two	no
5810	transcript	transcript_Bro004	are the results obtained by uh Pratibha with  uh his on-line normalization - uh  her  on-line normalization approach.	no
5811	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Where is that? seventy-nine, fifty	no
5812	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Fifty-one? This -	no
5813	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh, it's just sort of sitting right on the uh - the column line.	no
5814	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So.	no
5815	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh.	no
5816	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Oh I see, O_K.	no
5817	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Just - uh	no
5818	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5819	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5820	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So these are the results of  O_G_I with  on-line normalization and straight features to H_T_K.	no
5821	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And the previous result, eighty-six and so on,	no
5822	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yes.	no
5823	transcript	transcript_Bro004	are with our  features straight to H_T_K. So	no
5824	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yes.	no
5825	transcript	transcript_Bro004	what we see that - is - there is that um	no
5826	transcript	transcript_Bro004	uh the way we were doing this was not correct, but  still	no
5827	transcript	transcript_Bro004	the networks  are very good.	no
5828	transcript	transcript_Bro004	When we use the networks	no
5829	transcript	transcript_Bro004	our number are better that	no
5830	transcript	transcript_Bro004	We improve.	no
5831	transcript	transcript_Bro004	uh Pratibha results.	no
5832	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So, do you know what was  wrong  with the on-line normalization, or - ?	no
5833	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah. There were diff- there were different things and	no
5834	transcript	transcript_Bro004	basically,  the first thing is the mmm,	no
5835	transcript	transcript_Bro004	alpha uh  value. So, the recursion  uh  part.	no
5836	transcript	transcript_Bro004	um,	no
5837	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I used point five percent,  which was the default value in the -	no
5838	transcript	transcript_Bro004	in the programs here.	no
5839	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And Pratibha used  five  percent.	no
5840	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So it adapts more  quickly	no
5841	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh-huh.	no
5842	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yes. Yeah.	no
5843	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Um, but, yeah. I assume that this was not important because	no
5844	transcript	transcript_Bro004	uh previous results from - from Dan and - show that basically	no
5845	transcript	transcript_Bro004	the  both - both values g- give the same - same  uh results.	no
5846	transcript	transcript_Bro004	It was true on uh  T_I-digits but it's not true on Italian.	no
5847	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
5848	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh, second thing is the initialization of the  stuff. Actually,	no
5849	transcript	transcript_Bro004	uh what we were doing is to start the recursion from the beginning of the  utterance.	no
5850	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And using initial values that are the global mean and variances  measured across the  whole  database.	no
5851	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Right.  Right.	no
5852	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And Pratibha did something different is that he - uh she initialed the um values of the mean and variance	no
5853	transcript	transcript_Bro004	by computing  this on the  twenty-five first frames of each utterance.	no
5854	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mmm. There were other minor differences, the fact that	no
5855	transcript	transcript_Bro004	she used fifteen  dissities  instead s- instead of thirteen,	no
5856	transcript	transcript_Bro004	and that she used C_zero instead of log energy.	no
5857	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh, but the main differences concerns the recursion.	no
5858	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So.	no
5859	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh, I changed the code	no
5860	transcript	transcript_Bro004	uh and now we have a baseline that's similar to the O_G_I baseline.	no
5861	transcript	transcript_Bro004	O_K.	no
5862	transcript	transcript_Bro004	We - It - it's  slightly    uh different because	no
5863	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I don't exactly initialize the same way she does.	no
5864	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Actually I start,	no
5865	transcript	transcript_Bro004	mmm, I don't wait to a fifteen - twenty-five - twenty-five frames	no
5866	transcript	transcript_Bro004	before computing a mean and the variance	no
5867	transcript	transcript_Bro004	to e- to - to start the recursion.	no
5868	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
5869	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5870	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I - I use the on-line scheme	no
5871	transcript	transcript_Bro004	and only start the re- recursion after the twenty-five -  twenty-fifth frame.	no
5872	transcript	transcript_Bro004	But, well it's similar.	no
5873	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So	no
5874	transcript	transcript_Bro004	uh I retrained  the networks with  these - well, the - the - the networks are retaining with these new  features.	no
5875	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
5876	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And, yeah.	no
5877	transcript	transcript_Bro004	O_K.	no
5878	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So basically what I expect is that	no
5879	transcript	transcript_Bro004	these numbers will a little bit go down but	no
5880	transcript	transcript_Bro004	perhaps not - not so much	no
5881	transcript	transcript_Bro004	because  I think the neural networks learn perhaps	no
5882	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Right.	no
5883	transcript	transcript_Bro004	to -	no
5884	transcript	transcript_Bro004	even if the features are not  normalized. It - it will learn how to normalize and -	no
5885	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Right.	no
5886	transcript	transcript_Bro004	O_K, but I think that	no
5887	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mmm.	no
5888	transcript	transcript_Bro004	given the pressure of time we probably want to draw -	no
5889	transcript	transcript_Bro004	because of  that    especially,  we wanna draw some  conclusions  from this, do some  reductions	no
5890	transcript	transcript_Bro004	in what we're  looking  at,	no
5891	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5892	transcript	transcript_Bro004	and make some  strong  decisions for what we're gonna do  testing  on before next  week.	no
5893	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So do you - are you - w-	no
5894	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah   I'd  -	no
5895	transcript	transcript_Bro004	did you have something going on, on the side, with uh multi-band  or - on - on this, or - ?	no
5896	transcript	transcript_Bro004	No, I - we plan to start this uh so, act- actually we have discussed uh	no
5897	transcript	transcript_Bro004	@@  um, these -	no
5898	transcript	transcript_Bro004	what we could do	no
5899	transcript	transcript_Bro004	more as a - as a research and -	no
5900	transcript	transcript_Bro004	and  we were thinking perhaps that	no
5901	transcript	transcript_Bro004	uh  the way we use the tandem is not -	no
5902	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh, well, there is basically perhaps a flaw in the - in the - the stuff because	no
5903	transcript	transcript_Bro004	we  trained the networks -	no
5904	transcript	transcript_Bro004	If we trained the networks on the - on	no
5905	transcript	transcript_Bro004	a language and a t- or a specific  task,	no
5906	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
5907	transcript	transcript_Bro004	um, what we ask is - to the network - is to put the bound- the decision boundaries somewhere in the space.	no
5908	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And uh  mmm and ask the network to put one,	no
5909	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mmm.	no
5910	transcript	transcript_Bro004	at one side of the - for - for a particular phoneme at one side of the boundary - decision boundary and one for another phoneme at the other side.	no
5911	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And  so there is kind of reduction of the information there that's not correct because if we change task	no
5912	transcript	transcript_Bro004	and if the phonemes are not in the same context in the new task,	no
5913	transcript	transcript_Bro004	obviously the  decision boundaries are not -	no
5914	transcript	transcript_Bro004	should not be at the same  place.	no
5915	transcript	transcript_Bro004	But the way the feature gives -	no
5916	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I di-	no
5917	transcript	transcript_Bro004	The - the way the network gives the features is that it reduce completely the -	no
5918	transcript	transcript_Bro004	it removes completely the information -	no
5919	transcript	transcript_Bro004	a lot of information from the - the features	no
5920	transcript	transcript_Bro004	by uh	no
5921	transcript	transcript_Bro004	uh	no
5922	transcript	transcript_Bro004	placing the decision boundaries at  optimal places for	no
5923	transcript	transcript_Bro004	one kind of  data  but	no
5924	transcript	transcript_Bro004	this is not the case for another kind of data.	no
5925	transcript	transcript_Bro004	It's  a  trade-off,  right?  Any-  anyway  go  ahead.	no
5926	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So -	no
5927	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah. So uh what we were thinking about is perhaps	no
5928	transcript	transcript_Bro004	um one way	no
5929	transcript	transcript_Bro004	to solve this problem is increase the number of  outputs of the neural networks.	no
5930	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Doing something like, um	no
5931	transcript	transcript_Bro004	um phonemes within context and,	no
5932	transcript	transcript_Bro004	well, basically context dependent phonemes.	no
5933	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Maybe. I mean, I - I think	no
5934	transcript	transcript_Bro004	you could make  the same argument,	no
5935	transcript	transcript_Bro004	it'd be just as legitimate,	no
5936	transcript	transcript_Bro004	for hybrid systems	no
5937	transcript	transcript_Bro004	as well.	no
5938	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah but, we know that -	no
5939	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Right.	no
5940	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And in fact,	no
5941	transcript	transcript_Bro004	th- things get  better  with context  dependent    versions.	no
5942	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Right?	no
5943	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Ye- yeah but here it's something different. We want to have features uh well,	no
5944	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5945	transcript	transcript_Bro004	um.	no
5946	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah,  but it's  still  true	no
5947	transcript	transcript_Bro004	that what you're doing	no
5948	transcript	transcript_Bro004	is  you're ignoring -	no
5949	transcript	transcript_Bro004	you're - you're coming up with something to represent,	no
5950	transcript	transcript_Bro004	whether it's a distribution,	no
5951	transcript	transcript_Bro004	probability distribution or  features,	no
5952	transcript	transcript_Bro004	you're coming up with a set of variables	no
5953	transcript	transcript_Bro004	that are representing	no
5954	transcript	transcript_Bro004	uh,	no
5955	transcript	transcript_Bro004	things that vary w- over context.	no
5956	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
5957	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh, and you're  putting it all  together,	no
5958	transcript	transcript_Bro004	ignoring  the differences in context.	no
5959	transcript	transcript_Bro004	That - that's true	no
5960	transcript	transcript_Bro004	for the hybrid system,	no
5961	transcript	transcript_Bro004	it's true for a tandem system.	no
5962	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So, for that reason, when you - in -	no
5963	transcript	transcript_Bro004	in - in a  hybrid  system,	no
5964	transcript	transcript_Bro004	when you incorporate  context  one way or another,	no
5965	transcript	transcript_Bro004	you  do  get better  scores.	no
5966	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5967	transcript	transcript_Bro004	O_K?  But I - it's - it's a big  deal	no
5968	transcript	transcript_Bro004	to  get  that.	no
5969	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I - I'm - I'm sort of -	no
5970	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And  once  you - the other thing is that  once  you represent - start representing more and more  context	no
5971	transcript	transcript_Bro004	it  is   uh	no
5972	transcript	transcript_Bro004	much more	no
5973	transcript	transcript_Bro004	um  specific	no
5974	transcript	transcript_Bro004	to a particular task in  language.	no
5975	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So um	no
5976	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh, the -	no
5977	transcript	transcript_Bro004	the  acoustics   associated  with  uh	no
5978	transcript	transcript_Bro004	a particular context, for instance you may have some kinds of contexts that will  never  occur	no
5979	transcript	transcript_Bro004	in one language and will occur  frequently  in the  other,  so the qu- the issue of getting enough  training	no
5980	transcript	transcript_Bro004	for a particular kind of  context  becomes harder.	no
5981	transcript	transcript_Bro004	We already actually don't have a huge amount of training data	no
5982	transcript	transcript_Bro004	um	no
5983	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah, but -	no
5984	transcript	transcript_Bro004	mmm,	no
5985	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I mean,  the - the way we - we do it now is that we have a neural network and	no
5986	transcript	transcript_Bro004	basically	no
5987	transcript	transcript_Bro004	the net- network is trained almost to give binary decisions.	no
5988	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Right.	no
5989	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And  uh -	no
5990	transcript	transcript_Bro004	binary decisions about  phonemes.  Nnn -	no
5991	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh	no
5992	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Almost.	no
5993	transcript	transcript_Bro004	But I mean it - it - it  does  give a  distribution.	no
5994	transcript	transcript_Bro004	It's -	no
5995	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
5996	transcript	transcript_Bro004	It's - and -	no
5997	transcript	transcript_Bro004	and  it  is  true that if there's two phones that are very  similar,	no
5998	transcript	transcript_Bro004	that  uh  the -	no
5999	transcript	transcript_Bro004	i- it may prefer one but it will	no
6000	transcript	transcript_Bro004	give a reasonably high value to the other, too.	no
6001	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
6002	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah, sure but  uh	no
6003	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So basically it's almost binary decisions and	no
6004	transcript	transcript_Bro004	um the idea of using more  classes is	no
6005	transcript	transcript_Bro004	to  get something that's  less binary decisions.	no
6006	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Oh no, but it would  still  be even  more  of a binary decision.	no
6007	transcript	transcript_Bro004	It - it'd be even  more  of one.	no
6008	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Because then you would say	no
6009	transcript	transcript_Bro004	But - yeah, but -	no
6010	transcript	transcript_Bro004	that in - that this phone in  this  context is a  one,	no
6011	transcript	transcript_Bro004	but the  same  phone in a slightly  different  context is a  zero.	no
6012	transcript	transcript_Bro004	That would be even - even  more  distinct of a binary decision.	no
6013	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I  actually would have thought you'd wanna go the  other  way and have  fewer  classes.	no
6014	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah, but if -	no
6015	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh, I mean for instance,	no
6016	transcript	transcript_Bro004	the - the thing I was arguing for  before,  but	no
6017	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mmm.	no
6018	transcript	transcript_Bro004	again which I don't think we have time to  try,	no
6019	transcript	transcript_Bro004	is something in which you would modify the code so you could train to have several outputs on and use articulatory features	no
6020	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
6021	transcript	transcript_Bro004	cuz then that would - that would go -	no
6022	transcript	transcript_Bro004	that would be much  broader  and cover many different  situations.	no
6023	transcript	transcript_Bro004	But if you go to  very  very  fine  categories, it's  very   binary.	no
6024	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mmm.  Yeah, but I think -	no
6025	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah, perhaps you're right, but you have more classes so  you - you have more information in your features. So,	no
6026	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
6027	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Um  You have more information in the	no
6028	transcript	transcript_Bro004	True.	no
6029	transcript	transcript_Bro004	uh posteriors vector	no
6030	transcript	transcript_Bro004	um	no
6031	transcript	transcript_Bro004	which means that -	no
6032	transcript	transcript_Bro004	But still the information is relevant because it's - it's information that helps to discriminate,	no
6033	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
6034	transcript	transcript_Bro004	if it's possible to be able to discriminate	no
6035	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
6036	transcript	transcript_Bro004	among the phonemes in context.	no
6037	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Well it's - it's -	no
6038	transcript	transcript_Bro004	But the -	no
6039	transcript	transcript_Bro004	it's an interesting thought. I mean we - we could disagree about it at length	no
6040	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mmm.	no
6041	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mmm.	no
6042	transcript	transcript_Bro004	but the - the  real  thing is if you're interested in it you'll probably try it and -	no
6043	transcript	transcript_Bro004	and  we'll see.	no
6044	transcript	transcript_Bro004	But - but what I'm  more  concerned with now, as an operational level, is	no
6045	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mmm.	no
6046	transcript	transcript_Bro004	uh, you know, what do we do in four or five days?	no
6047	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh, and -	no
6048	transcript	transcript_Bro004	so we have  to be concerned  with	no
6049	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Are we gonna look at any combinations of things, you know once the nets get retrained so you have this problem out of it.	no
6050	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mmm.	no
6051	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Um, are we going to look at  multi-band? Are we gonna look at combinations of things?	no
6052	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh, what  questions  are we gonna ask,	no
6053	transcript	transcript_Bro004	uh now that, I mean,	no
6054	transcript	transcript_Bro004	we should probably turn shortly to this O_G_ I  note.	no
6055	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Um, how are we going to  combine	no
6056	transcript	transcript_Bro004	with what  they've  been focusing on?	no
6057	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh,	no
6058	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh we haven't been doing any of the L_D_ A  RASTA sort of thing.	no
6059	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
6060	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And they, although they don't  talk  about it in this  note,  um,	no
6061	transcript	transcript_Bro004	there's um,  the issue of the	no
6062	transcript	transcript_Bro004	um  Mu law   business  uh  versus the logarithm,	no
6063	transcript	transcript_Bro004	um,  so.	no
6064	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
6065	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So what i- what is going on right  now?  What's right - you've got	no
6066	transcript	transcript_Bro004	nets retraining,	no
6067	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Are there - is there - are there any H_T_ K   trainings - testings going on?	no
6068	transcript	transcript_Bro004	N-	no
6069	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I - I - I'm trying the H_T_K with eh,	no
6070	transcript	transcript_Bro004	P_L_P twelve on-line delta-delta and  M_S_G   filter  together.	no
6071	transcript	transcript_Bro004	The combination, I see.	no
6072	transcript	transcript_Bro004	The combination, yeah. But I haven't result  at this moment.	no
6073	transcript	transcript_Bro004	M_S_G and - and P_L_P.	no
6074	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
6075	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And is this with the revised  on-line normalization?	no
6076	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Ye- Uh, with the old   older , yeah.	no
6077	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
6078	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Old  one.	no
6079	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So it's using all the nets for that but again we have the hope that it -	no
6080	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.  But  We can	no
6081	transcript	transcript_Bro004	We have the hope that it -	no
6082	transcript	transcript_Bro004	know soon.	no
6083	transcript	transcript_Bro004	maybe it's not making too much difference,	no
6084	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Maybe.	no
6085	transcript	transcript_Bro004	but - but yeah.	no
6086	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I don't know.	no
6087	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
6088	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh, O_K.	no
6089	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh so there is this combination, yeah. Working on combination obviously.	no
6090	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Um, I will start work on multi-band.	no
6091	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
6092	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And  we	no
6093	transcript	transcript_Bro004	plan to work also on the idea of using both	no
6094	transcript	transcript_Bro004	features  and net outputs.	no
6095	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yep.	no
6096	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Um.	no
6097	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And  we think that	no
6098	transcript	transcript_Bro004	with this approach perhaps	no
6099	transcript	transcript_Bro004	we could reduce the number of outputs of the neural network.	no
6100	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Um,	no
6101	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So, get simpler networks,	no
6102	transcript	transcript_Bro004	because we still have the features.	no
6103	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So we have um	no
6104	transcript	transcript_Bro004	come up with um	no
6105	transcript	transcript_Bro004	different kind of  broad phonetic categories.	no
6106	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And we have -	no
6107	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Basically we have three  types of broad phonetic classes.	no
6108	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Well, something using place of articulation which - which leads to  nine, I think,  broad classes.	no
6109	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh, another which is based on manner, which is - is also something like nine classes.	no
6110	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And then,  something that combine both,	no
6111	transcript	transcript_Bro004	and we have  twenty f-  twenty-five?	no
6112	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Twenty-seven.	no
6113	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Twenty-seven broad classes.	no
6114	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So like, uh,  oh, I don't know,	no
6115	transcript	transcript_Bro004	like back vowels, front vowels.	no
6116	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So what you do -	no
6117	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Um	no
6118	transcript	transcript_Bro004	um I just wanna understand so	no
6119	transcript	transcript_Bro004	You have  two  net or  three  nets?  Was this?	no
6120	transcript	transcript_Bro004	How many - how many nets do you have?	no
6121	transcript	transcript_Bro004	For the moments we do not - don't have nets, I mean,	no
6122	transcript	transcript_Bro004	No nets.	no
6123	transcript	transcript_Bro004	It's just -	no
6124	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Begin to work in this.	no
6125	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Were we just changing  the labels to retrain nets  with fewer out- outputs.	no
6126	transcript	transcript_Bro004	We are   @@ .	no
6127	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Right.	no
6128	transcript	transcript_Bro004	But - but I didn't understand -	no
6129	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And then -	no
6130	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
6131	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh.	no
6132	transcript	transcript_Bro004	the software currently just has - uh a - allows for I think, the one - one hot	no
6133	transcript	transcript_Bro004	output. So you're having multiple nets and combining them,  or - ?	no
6134	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh, how are you - how are you coming up with -	no
6135	transcript	transcript_Bro004	If you say  uh  If you have a  place   characteristic and a  manner  characteristic, how do you -	no
6136	transcript	transcript_Bro004	It-	no
6137	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I think they have one output.	no
6138	transcript	transcript_Bro004	It's the single net, yeah.	no
6139	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Oh, it's just one net.	no
6140	transcript	transcript_Bro004	mm-hmm	no
6141	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
6142	transcript	transcript_Bro004	It's one net with	no
6143	transcript	transcript_Bro004	um  twenty-seven outputs if we have twenty-seven classes, yeah.	no
6144	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I see.	no
6145	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I see, O_K.	no
6146	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So it's - Well, it's basically a standard net with fewer  classes.	no
6147	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So you're sort of going the  other  way of what you were saying a bit ago instead of - yeah.	no
6148	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah, but I think - Yeah.	no
6149	transcript	transcript_Bro004	But  including  the  features.	no
6150	transcript	transcript_Bro004	B- b-	no
6151	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
6152	transcript	transcript_Bro004	including  the features, yeah.	no
6153	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I don't think this  will work  alone.	no
6154	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I think it will get worse because	no
6155	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh-huh.	no
6156	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Well, I believe the effect that - of - of too	no
6157	transcript	transcript_Bro004	reducing too much the information is	no
6158	transcript	transcript_Bro004	basically - basically what happens and -	no
6159	transcript	transcript_Bro004	but -	no
6160	transcript	transcript_Bro004	But you think if you include that	no
6161	transcript	transcript_Bro004	plus  the other features,	no
6162	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah, because  there is perhaps one important thing that the net	no
6163	transcript	transcript_Bro004	brings, and O_G_I  show-   showed  that, is	no
6164	transcript	transcript_Bro004	the distinction between  sp- speech and  silence	no
6165	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Because these nets are trained on well-controlled condition. I mean the labels are obtained on clean speech, and we add noise after.	no
6166	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So this is one thing	no
6167	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And	no
6168	transcript	transcript_Bro004	But perhaps, something intermediary using also	no
6169	transcript	transcript_Bro004	some broad classes could - could bring so much more information.	no
6170	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh.	no
6171	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So - so again then we have these broad classes	no
6172	transcript	transcript_Bro004	and -	no
6173	transcript	transcript_Bro004	well,  somewhat  broad. I mean, it's twenty-seven instead of sixty-four,	no
6174	transcript	transcript_Bro004	basically.	no
6175	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
6176	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And you have the  original  features.	no
6177	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
6178	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Which are P_L_P, or something.	no
6179	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
6180	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And then uh, just to remind me, all of that goes  into -	no
6181	transcript	transcript_Bro004	uh, that all of that is transformed by uh, uh, K_- K_L or something, or - ?	no
6182	transcript	transcript_Bro004	There will probably be, yeah, one single K_L to transform everything or	no
6183	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mu.	no
6184	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Right.	no
6185	transcript	transcript_Bro004	uh, per-	no
6186	transcript	transcript_Bro004	No transform the P_L_P and only	no
6187	transcript	transcript_Bro004	transform the other	no
6188	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I'm not sure.	no
6189	transcript	transcript_Bro004	This is  still something  that yeah, we  don't know -	no
6190	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Well no, I think -	no
6191	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I  see.	no
6192	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Two e-	no
6193	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So there's a question of whether you would -	no
6194	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
6195	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Right.	no
6196	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Whether you would transform  together  or just  one.	no
6197	transcript	transcript_Bro004	@@  it's one.	no
6198	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
6199	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Might wanna try it both ways.	no
6200	transcript	transcript_Bro004	But that's  interesting.	no
6201	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So that's something that you're - you  haven't  trained yet but are  preparing  to train, and -	no
6202	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
6203	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
6204	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Um	no

6207	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Monday or Tuesday. So	no
6208	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh, yeah.	no

6284	transcript	transcript_Bro004	a set of training  to obtain the filter.	no
6285	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And maybe  for the Italian, for the  T_D    T_E  on for Finnish, these filter are - are obtained with their own training set.	no
6286	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yes.	no
6287	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yes, I don't know.	no
6288	transcript	transcript_Bro004	That's - that's - so that's a -	no
6289	transcript	transcript_Bro004	that's a very good question, then -	no
6290	transcript	transcript_Bro004	now that it -	no
6291	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I understand it. It's	no
6292	transcript	transcript_Bro004	"""yeah, where does the L_D_A come from?"" In the -"	no
6293	transcript	transcript_Bro004	In   earlier  experiments, they had taken L_D_A	no
6294	transcript	transcript_Bro004	from a  completely  different  database,  right?	no
6295	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
6296	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah, because maybe it the same situation that the neural network training with their own	no
6297	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mmm.	no
6298	transcript	transcript_Bro004	set.	no
6299	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So that's a good question.   Where  does it come from?	no
6300	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah, I don't know.	no
6301	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Um,	no
6302	transcript	transcript_Bro004	but uh to tell you the  truth, I wasn't actually looking at the L_D_A so much when I - I was looking at it I was  mostly thinking about the -  the V_A_D.	no
6303	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And um, it ap-	no
6304	transcript	transcript_Bro004	it ap-	no
6305	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Oh what does - what does A_S_P?	no
6306	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Oh that's -	no
6307	transcript	transcript_Bro004	The features, yeah.	no
6308	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
6309	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I don't understand also what is -	no
6310	transcript	transcript_Bro004	"It says ""baseline A_S_P""."	no
6311	transcript	transcript_Bro004	what is the  difference  between A_S_P and uh baseline  over ?	no
6312	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah, I don't know.	no
6313	transcript	transcript_Bro004	A_S_P.	no
6314	transcript	transcript_Bro004	This is -	no
6315	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Oh.	no
6316	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Anybody know   any  -	no
6317	transcript	transcript_Bro004	There  it is.	no
6318	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Um	no
6319	transcript	transcript_Bro004	"Cuz there's ""baseline  Aurora ""   above  it."	no
6320	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
6321	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And it's -	no
6322	transcript	transcript_Bro004	This is  mostly  better than baseline, although in some cases it's a little worse, in a couple cases.	no
6323	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Well, it says baseline A_S_P is twenty-three mill	no
6324	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
6325	transcript	transcript_Bro004	minus thirteen.	no
6326	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah, it  says  what it  is.  But I don't how that's different  from -	no
6327	transcript	transcript_Bro004	From the baseline.  O_K.	no
6328	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I think this was -	no
6329	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
6330	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I think this is the same point we were at	no
6331	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I think -	no
6332	transcript	transcript_Bro004	when - when we were up in Oregon.	no
6333	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I think it's the C_zero - using C_zero instead of log energy. Yeah, it's  this.	no
6334	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Ah, O_K, mm-hmm.	no
6335	transcript	transcript_Bro004	yeah.	no
6336	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Oh.	no
6337	transcript	transcript_Bro004	O_K.	no
6338	transcript	transcript_Bro004	It should be that, yeah.	no
6339	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Because -	no
6340	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Shouldn't it be -	no
6341	transcript	transcript_Bro004	They s-	no
6342	transcript	transcript_Bro004	they say in here that the V_A_D is  not  used as an additional feature. Does - does anybody know  how  they're using it?	no
6343	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.  So - so what they're doing here is,	no
6344	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
6345	transcript	transcript_Bro004	i- if you look down at the block diagram,	no
6346	transcript	transcript_Bro004	um,	no
6347	transcript	transcript_Bro004	they estimate - they get a -	no
6348	transcript	transcript_Bro004	But that -	no
6349	transcript	transcript_Bro004	they get an estimate  of whether it's speech or silence,	no
6350	transcript	transcript_Bro004	and then they have a median  filter  of it.	no
6351	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
6352	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And so um,	no
6353	transcript	transcript_Bro004	basically they're trying to find  stretches.	no
6354	transcript	transcript_Bro004	The median filter is enforcing a - i- it having some  continuity.	no
6355	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
6356	transcript	transcript_Bro004	You find  stretches  where the  combination of the  frame wise V_A_D and the -	no
6357	transcript	transcript_Bro004	the median  filter  say that there's a stretch of  silence.	no
6358	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And then it's going through and just throwing the  data  away.	no
6359	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Hmm.	no
6360	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Right?	no
6361	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So um -	no
6362	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So it's - it's -	no
6363	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I don't understand. You mean it's throwing out frames?	no
6364	transcript	transcript_Bro004	It's throwing out chunks of frames, yeah.	no
6365	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Before -	no
6366	transcript	transcript_Bro004	There's - the - the median filter is enforcing that it's  not  gonna be single cases of frames, or isolated frames.	no
6367	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
6368	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So it's throwing out frames	no
6369	transcript	transcript_Bro004	and the thing is  um,	no
6370	transcript	transcript_Bro004	what I don't understand is how they're doing this with H_T_ K.	no
6371	transcript	transcript_Bro004	This is -	no
6372	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah, that's what I was just gonna ask. How can you just throw out frames?	no
6373	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
6374	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Well,	no
6375	transcript	transcript_Bro004	i-	no
6376	transcript	transcript_Bro004	you - you  can,  right? I mean y- you - you -	no
6377	transcript	transcript_Bro004	it  stretches  again. For single frames I think it would be pretty  hard.  But if you say speech starts here, speech ends there.  Right?	no
6378	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
6379	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
6380	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
6381	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Huh.	no
6382	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
6383	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah, you can basically remove the - the frames from the feature - feature files. And.	no
6384	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
6385	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah, so I mean in the - i- i- in the - in the  decoding,  you're saying that we're gonna decode from here to here.	no
6386	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I t-	no
6387	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
6388	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I think they're - they're - they're treating it,	no
6389	transcript	transcript_Bro004	you know, like uh -	no
6390	transcript	transcript_Bro004	well, it's not isolated word, but - but connected, you know, the - the -	no
6391	transcript	transcript_Bro004	In the text they say that this - this is a  tentative  block diagram of a  possible  configuration we could  think  of.	no
6392	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So that sort of sounds like they're not  doing  that yet.	no
6393	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Well.  No they - they have  numbers  though, right?  So I think they're - they're doing something like that. I think that they're - they're -	no
6394	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I think what I mean by tha- that is they're trying to come up with a block diagram that's plausible for the standard.	no
6395	transcript	transcript_Bro004	In other words, it's - uh -	no
6396	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I mean from the point of view of - of uh reducing the number of bits you have to transmit it's not a bad idea to detect silence  anyway.	no
6397	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
6398	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
6399	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I'm just wondering what exactly  did  they do up in  this  table if it wasn't this.	no
6400	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Um.	no
6401	transcript	transcript_Bro004	But it's - the thing is it's that - that - that's - that's I - I -	no
6402	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Certainly it would be tricky about it intrans- in transmitting  voice,	no
6403	transcript	transcript_Bro004	uh uh for  listening  to, is that these kinds of things	no
6404	transcript	transcript_Bro004	uh cut  speech  off  a lot. Right?	no
6405	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And so  um	no
6406	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
6407	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Plus it's gonna introduce delays.	no
6408	transcript	transcript_Bro004	It  does  introduce delays but they're claiming that it's - it's within the -	no
6409	transcript	transcript_Bro004	the boundaries of it.	no
6410	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mmm.	no
6411	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And the L_D_A introduces delays, and b-  what he's suggesting this here is a parallel path so that it doesn't introduce	no
6412	transcript	transcript_Bro004	uh, any more delay.	no
6413	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I- it introduces two hundred milliseconds of delay but at the same  time the L_D_A  down here -	no
6414	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I  don't know -  Wh- what's the difference between  T_L_D_A  and  S_L_D_A ?	no
6415	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Temporal and spectral.	no
6416	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Ah, thank you.	no
6417	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Temporal  L_D_A.	no
6418	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah, you  would  know that.	no
6419	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah	no
6420	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So um.	no
6421	transcript	transcript_Bro004	The  temporal  L_D_A does in fact include the same -	no
6422	transcript	transcript_Bro004	so that - I think	no
6423	transcript	transcript_Bro004	he - well, by -	no
6424	transcript	transcript_Bro004	by saying this is a b- a tentative block di- diagram I think means	no
6425	transcript	transcript_Bro004	if you construct it this way, this - this delay would work in that way and then it'd be O_K.	no
6426	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Ah.	no
6427	transcript	transcript_Bro004	They - they clearly  did  actually  remove    silent  sections in order - because they	no
6428	transcript	transcript_Bro004	got these   word  error rate  results.	no
6429	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So um	no
6430	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I think that it's - it's  nice  to do that in this because in fact, it's gonna give a better word error result	no
6431	transcript	transcript_Bro004	and therefore will help within an evaluation.	no
6432	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Whereas to whether this would actually be in a final standard, I don't know.	no
6433	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Um.	no
6434	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh, as you know,  part  of the problem with evaluation right now is that the  word models are pretty bad and nobody wants -	no
6435	transcript	transcript_Bro004	has - has approached improving them.	no
6436	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So  it's possible that a lot of the problems	no
6437	transcript	transcript_Bro004	with so many insertions and so forth would go away if they were better word models  to begin with.	no
6438	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So	no
6439	transcript	transcript_Bro004	this might just be a temporary thing. But -	no
6440	transcript	transcript_Bro004	But, on the  other  hand, and maybe - maybe it's a decent idea.	no
6441	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So um	no
6442	transcript	transcript_Bro004	The question we're gonna wanna go  through next week when Hynek shows up I guess is given that we've been -	no
6443	transcript	transcript_Bro004	if you look at what we've been trying,	no
6444	transcript	transcript_Bro004	we're uh looking at	no
6445	transcript	transcript_Bro004	uh, by  then  I guess,	no
6446	transcript	transcript_Bro004	combinations of features and multi-band	no
6447	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh, and we've been looking at  cross-language, cross  task  issues.	no
6448	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And they've been not so much looking at	no
6449	transcript	transcript_Bro004	the cross task uh multiple language issues.	no
6450	transcript	transcript_Bro004	But they've been looking at uh -  at these issues. At the	no
6451	transcript	transcript_Bro004	on-line normalization and the uh	no
6452	transcript	transcript_Bro004	voice activity detection.	no
6453	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And I guess when he comes here we're gonna have to start deciding about	no
6454	transcript	transcript_Bro004	um what do we choose	no
6455	transcript	transcript_Bro004	from what we've looked at	no
6456	transcript	transcript_Bro004	to um blend with  some group of things in what they've looked at	no
6457	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And once we  choose  that,	no
6458	transcript	transcript_Bro004	how do we split up the  effort?	no
6459	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh, because we still have - even once we  choose,	no
6460	transcript	transcript_Bro004	we've still got  uh another	no
6461	transcript	transcript_Bro004	month or so, I mean there's holidays in the way,	no
6462	transcript	transcript_Bro004	but - but uh	no
6463	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I  think  the evaluation data comes January thirty- first  so there's still a fair amount of time	no
6464	transcript	transcript_Bro004	to  do  things together it's just that they probably should be somewhat more  coherent  between the two  sites	no
6465	transcript	transcript_Bro004	in that - that amount of time.	no
6466	transcript	transcript_Bro004	When they removed the silence frames, did they insert some kind of a marker so that the recognizer knows it's -  knows when it's time to back trace or something?	no
6467	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Well, see they, I - I think they're	no
6468	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Um.	no
6469	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I don't know the -	no
6470	transcript	transcript_Bro004	the specifics of how they're doing it. They're -	no
6471	transcript	transcript_Bro004	they're getting around the way the recognizer works because they're not allowed to	no
6472	transcript	transcript_Bro004	um,  change  the  scripts	no
6473	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Oh, right.	no
6474	transcript	transcript_Bro004	for the  recognizer,	no
6475	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I believe. So. Uh.	no
6476	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Maybe they're just inserting some nummy frames or something?	no
6477	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh, you know  that's  what  I  had thought.	no
6478	transcript	transcript_Bro004	But I don't - I don't think they  are.	no
6479	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I mean that's - sort of what - the way  I  had imagined would  happen  is that on the other side, yeah you	no
6480	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Hmm.	no
6481	transcript	transcript_Bro004	p- put some low level noise or something.	no
6482	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Probably don't want all zeros. Most recognizers don't like zeros but	no
6483	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Hmm.	no
6484	transcript	transcript_Bro004	but  you know,	no
6485	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
6486	transcript	transcript_Bro004	put some epsilon in or some rand- sorry epsilon random variable	no
6487	transcript	transcript_Bro004	in or something.	no
6488	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Some constant vector.	no
6489	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Maybe not a constant but it doesn't, uh - don't like to divide by the variance of that,	no
6490	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I mean i- w-	no
6491	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Or something -	no
6492	transcript	transcript_Bro004	but I mean it's	no
6493	transcript	transcript_Bro004	That's right. But something that - what I mean is something that is  very distinguishable from  speech.	no
6494	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
6495	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So that the - the  silence  model in H_T_K will always pick it up.	no
6496	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah. So I - I - that's what I thought they would do.	no
6497	transcript	transcript_Bro004	or else, uh  uh maybe there  is  some indicator to tell it to start and stop, I don't know.	no
6498	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Hmm.	no
6499	transcript	transcript_Bro004	But  whatever  they did, I mean they have to play within the rules of this specific evaluation.	no
6500	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
6501	transcript	transcript_Bro004	We c- we can find out.	no
6502	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Cuz you gotta do  something.   Otherwise,  if it's just a bunch of  speech,   stuck   together  -	no
6503	transcript	transcript_Bro004	No  they're -	no
6504	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
6505	transcript	transcript_Bro004	It would do  badly  and it didn't so  badly,  right? So  they  did  something.	no
6506	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah, right.	no
6507	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah, yeah.	no
6508	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
6509	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh.	no
6510	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So, O_K, So I think	yes
6511	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So, O_K, So I think	no
6512	transcript	transcript_Bro004	this brings  me  up to date a bit.	no
6513	transcript	transcript_Bro004	It hopefully brings other  people up to date a bit.	no
6514	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And um	no
6515	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Um  I think -	no
6516	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh, I wanna look at these numbers off-line a little bit and think about it and -  and talk with everybody uh,  outside of this meeting.	no
6517	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Um, but uh	no
6518	transcript	transcript_Bro004	No I mean it sounds like - I mean	no
6519	transcript	transcript_Bro004	there - there - there are the usual number of - of	no
6520	transcript	transcript_Bro004	little - little problems and bugs and so forth but it sounds like they're getting ironed out.	no
6521	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And now we're	no
6522	transcript	transcript_Bro004	seem to be kind of in a position to actually  uh,	no
6523	transcript	transcript_Bro004	look  at stuff and - and - and  compare  things.	no
6524	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So I think that's - that's pretty good.	no
6525	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Um	no
6526	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I don't know what the -	no
6527	transcript	transcript_Bro004	One of the things I wonder about,	no
6528	transcript	transcript_Bro004	coming back to the first results you talked about, is - is	no
6529	transcript	transcript_Bro004	how much,  uh  things could be helped	no
6530	transcript	transcript_Bro004	by more parameters.	no
6531	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And uh -	no
6532	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And uh how many more parameters we can afford to  have,	no
6533	transcript	transcript_Bro004	in terms of the uh computational limits.	no
6534	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Because  anyway  when we go to	no
6535	transcript	transcript_Bro004	twice  as much  data	no
6536	transcript	transcript_Bro004	and have the  same  number of  parameters,	no
6537	transcript	transcript_Bro004	particularly when it's twice as much data  and  it's quite  diverse,	no
6538	transcript	transcript_Bro004	um, I wonder if having twice as many parameters would  help.	no
6539	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh, just have a bigger hidden  layer.	no
6540	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
6541	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh	no
6542	transcript	transcript_Bro004	But -	no
6543	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I  doubt  it would  help by forty per  cent.	no
6544	transcript	transcript_Bro004	But	no
6545	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
6546	transcript	transcript_Bro004	but uh	no
6547	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Just  curious.	no
6548	transcript	transcript_Bro004	How are we doing on the	no
6549	transcript	transcript_Bro004	resources? Disk, and -	no
6550	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I think we're alright, um,  not much problems with that.	no
6551	transcript	transcript_Bro004	O_K.	no
6552	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Computation?	no
6553	transcript	transcript_Bro004	It's O_K.	no
6554	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Well this table took uh  more than five days to  get   back .	no
6555	transcript	transcript_Bro004	We -	no
6556	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah. Yeah, well.	no
6557	transcript	transcript_Bro004	But -  Yeah.	no
6558	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Are - were you folks using Gin?  That's a - that just died, you know?	no
6559	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mmm, no. You were using Gin  perhaps, yeah?  No.	no
6560	transcript	transcript_Bro004	No.	no
6561	transcript	transcript_Bro004	It just died.	no
6562	transcript	transcript_Bro004	No? Oh, that's good. O_K.	no
6563	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah,	no
6564	transcript	transcript_Bro004	we're gonna get a replacement	no
6565	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yes.	no
6566	transcript	transcript_Bro004	server that'll be a faster server,	no
6567	transcript	transcript_Bro004	actually. That'll be - It's a	no
6568	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Hmm.	no
6569	transcript	transcript_Bro004	seven hundred fifty megahertz uh SUN	no
6570	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Tonic.	no
6571	transcript	transcript_Bro004	uh	no
6572	transcript	transcript_Bro004	But it won't be installed for  a little while.	no
6573	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
6574	transcript	transcript_Bro004	U-	no
6575	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Do we -	no
6576	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Go ahead.	no
6577	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Do we have that big new I_B_M machine the, I think in th-	no
6578	transcript	transcript_Bro004	We have the  little tiny I_B_M machine	no
6579	transcript	transcript_Bro004	that might someday grow up to be a big  I_B_M machine.	no
6580	transcript	transcript_Bro004	It's got s- slots for eight,	no
6581	transcript	transcript_Bro004	uh I_B_M was donating  five,  I think we only got  two  so far,	no
6582	transcript	transcript_Bro004	processors.	no
6583	transcript	transcript_Bro004	We had originally hoped we were getting eight hundred megahertz processors. They ended up being five fifty.	no
6584	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So instead of having eight processors that were eight hundred megahertz, we ended up with two  that are five hundred and fifty megahertz.	no
6585	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And more are supposed to come soon and there's only a moderate amount of dat- of memory. So I don't think	no
6586	transcript	transcript_Bro004	anybody has been sufficiently excited by it to	no
6587	transcript	transcript_Bro004	spend much time	no
6588	transcript	transcript_Bro004	uh  with it, but uh	no
6589	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Hopefully,  they'll get us some more	no
6590	transcript	transcript_Bro004	parts, soon and -	no
6591	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh, yeah, I think that'll be - once we get it populated,	no
6592	transcript	transcript_Bro004	that'll be a nice  machine.  I mean we  will  ultimately get eight processors in there.	no
6593	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And uh - and uh a nice amount of memory. Uh so it'll be a pr- pretty fast Linux machine.	no
6594	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And if we can do things on Linux,  some of the machines we have going already, like Swede?	no
6595	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
6596	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Um	no
6597	transcript	transcript_Bro004	It seems pretty fast.	no
6598	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mm-hmm.	no
6599	transcript	transcript_Bro004	But -	no
6600	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I think Fudge is pretty fast too.	no
6601	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah, I mean you can  check  with uh  Dave  Johnson.  I mean, it - it's -	no
6602	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I  think  the machine is just  sitting  there.	no
6603	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And it  does  have two  processors,  you know and -	no
6604	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Somebody could do -	no
6605	transcript	transcript_Bro004	you know, uh, check out	no
6606	transcript	transcript_Bro004	uh the multi-threading  libraries. And	no
6607	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I mean i- it's possible that the -	no
6608	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I mean, I guess the  prudent  thing to do would be for somebody to do the work on -	no
6609	transcript	transcript_Bro004	on getting our code running	no
6610	transcript	transcript_Bro004	on that machine with  two  processors  even though there  aren't  five or eight.	no
6611	transcript	transcript_Bro004	There's - there's - there's gonna be  debugging  hassles	no
6612	transcript	transcript_Bro004	and then we'd be set for when we  did  have five or eight, to have it really be useful.	no
6613	transcript	transcript_Bro004	But.	no
6614	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Notice how I said somebody and	no
6615	transcript	transcript_Bro004	turned my head your direction. That's one thing you don't get in these recordings. You don't get the -	no
6616	transcript	transcript_Bro004	don't get the visuals but -	no
6617	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I- is it um  mostly um the neural network trainings that are  um slowing us down or the H_T_K runs that are slowing us down?	no
6618	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh, I think yes.	no
6619	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh,	no
6620	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Isn't that right? I mean I think you're - you're sort of held up by both, right?	no
6621	transcript	transcript_Bro004	If the - if the neural net trainings were a hundred times faster	no
6622	transcript	transcript_Bro004	you still wouldn't  be anything -	no
6623	transcript	transcript_Bro004	running through these a hundred times faster because you'd	no
6624	transcript	transcript_Bro004	be stuck by the H_T_K trainings, right?	no
6625	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mmm.	no
6626	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
6627	transcript	transcript_Bro004	But if the H_T_K - I mean I think they're both -	no
6628	transcript	transcript_Bro004	It sounded like they were roughly equal?	no
6629	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Is that about right?	no
6630	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
6631	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
6632	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Because, um  I  think  that'll be running Linux, and Sw- Swede and Fudge are already running Linux so,  um I could try to	no
6633	transcript	transcript_Bro004	get  um the train- the neural network trainings or the H_T_K stuff running under Linux, and to start with I'm  wondering which one I should pick first.	no
6634	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh, probably the neural net cuz it's probably - it - it's -	no
6635	transcript	transcript_Bro004	it's um -	no
6636	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Well, I - I don't know.	no
6637	transcript	transcript_Bro004	They both -	no
6638	transcript	transcript_Bro004	H_T_K we use for	no
6639	transcript	transcript_Bro004	um	no
6640	transcript	transcript_Bro004	this Aurora stuff	no
6641	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Um	no
6642	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Um, I think	no
6643	transcript	transcript_Bro004	It's not  clear  yet what we're gonna use	no
6644	transcript	transcript_Bro004	for trainings uh -	no
6645	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Well,	no
6646	transcript	transcript_Bro004	there's the trainings uh - is it the  training  that takes the time, or the  decoding?	no
6647	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh, is it about equal  between the two?	no
6648	transcript	transcript_Bro004	For - for Aurora?	no
6649	transcript	transcript_Bro004	For H_T_K?	no
6650	transcript	transcript_Bro004	For - Yeah. For the Aurora?	no
6651	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh	no
6652	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Training  is longer.	no
6653	transcript	transcript_Bro004	O_K.	no
6654	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
6655	transcript	transcript_Bro004	O_K.	no
6656	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Well, I don't know how we can -	no
6657	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I don't know how to -	no
6658	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Do we have H_T_K source? Is that -	no
6659	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mmm.	no
6660	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
6661	transcript	transcript_Bro004	You would  think  that would fairly trivially -	no
6662	transcript	transcript_Bro004	the  training  would,  anyway,  th- the  testing	no
6663	transcript	transcript_Bro004	uh I don't - I don't	no
6664	transcript	transcript_Bro004	think would	no
6665	transcript	transcript_Bro004	parallelize all that well.	no
6666	transcript	transcript_Bro004	But I think  that  you could	no
6667	transcript	transcript_Bro004	certainly do d- um,	no
6668	transcript	transcript_Bro004	distributed, sort of -  Ah, no, it's the -	no
6669	transcript	transcript_Bro004	each individual	no
6670	transcript	transcript_Bro004	sentence	no
6671	transcript	transcript_Bro004	is pretty tricky to parallelize.	no
6672	transcript	transcript_Bro004	But you could split up the sentences in a test set.	no
6673	transcript	transcript_Bro004	They  have  a - they have a thing for  doing  that and th- they have for  awhile,  in H_T_ K.	no
6674	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah?	no
6675	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And you can parallelize the training.	no
6676	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And run it on several machines and it just basically keeps counts.	no
6677	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Aha!	no
6678	transcript	transcript_Bro004	And there's something -	no
6679	transcript	transcript_Bro004	a final  thing that you run and it accumulates all the counts together.	no
6680	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I see.	no
6681	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Mmm.	no
6682	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I don't what their scripts are  set up to do for the  Aurora  stuff, but -	no
6683	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Yeah.	no
6684	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Something that we haven't really settled on yet is other than	no
6685	transcript	transcript_Bro004	this  Aurora  stuff,  uh what do we do, large vocabulary	no
6686	transcript	transcript_Bro004	training slash testing	no
6687	transcript	transcript_Bro004	for uh tandem systems.	no
6688	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Cuz we hadn't really  done  much with tandem systems for larger stuff.	no
6689	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Cuz we had this one collaboration with C_M_U and we used SPHINX.	no
6690	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Uh, we're also gonna be collaborating with S_R_I and we have their - have  theirs.	no
6691	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Um  So	no
6692	transcript	transcript_Bro004	I don't know	no
6693	transcript	transcript_Bro004	Um.	no
6694	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So I - I think the - the advantage of going with the neural net thing is that we're gonna use the neural net trainings,	no
6695	transcript	transcript_Bro004	no matter what,	no
6696	transcript	transcript_Bro004	O_K.	no
6697	transcript	transcript_Bro004	for a lot of the things we're doing,	no
6698	transcript	transcript_Bro004	whereas, w- exactly which	no
6699	transcript	transcript_Bro004	H_M_M - Gaussian-mixture-based H_M_M thing we use is gonna depend	no
6700	transcript	transcript_Bro004	uh	yes
6701	transcript	transcript_Bro004	So with that,	no
6702	transcript	transcript_Bro004	maybe we should uh	no
6703	transcript	transcript_Bro004	go to our	no
6704	transcript	transcript_Bro004	digit recitation task.	no

6931	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and, um  I - I sent a note about it to uh - to Adam and Jane but I think I'll just run through it	no
6932	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	also and see if someone thinks it's inaccurate or	no
6933	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	uh insufficient.	no

6948	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Um.	no
6949	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Sort of off-topic I guess. Cuz that's  Cuz that was all - all about the, uh -	no
6950	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Oh, O_K.	no
6951	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I - I - I can chat with you about that  off-line. That's another thing.	no

6954	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Anything else?  Nothing else?	no
6955	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Uh, there's a - I mean, there is a -  a, um	no
6956	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	uh	no
6957	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	telephone call tomorrow,	no
6958	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	which will be a conference call  that some of us are involved in	no
6959	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	for uh a possible proposal.	no
6960	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Um, we'll talk - we'll talk about it next week if - if something -	no
6961	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Do you want me to  be there for that?	no
6962	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I noticed you C_ C'ed  me, but I wasn't actually a recipient.	no
6963	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I didn't quite know what to make of that.	no
6964	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Uh Well, we'll talk - talk about that after our meeting.	no
6965	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	O_K.	no
6966	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	O_K.	no
6967	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Uh, O_K. So it sounds like the - the three main things that we have to talk about are, uh this list, uh Jane and - Jane and Adam have some research items, and, other than that, anything,	no
6968	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	as usual,	no
6969	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	anything goes beyond that.	no
6970	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	O_K, uh, Jane, since - since you were sort of cut off last time why don't we start with yours, make sure we get to it.	no
6971	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	O_K, it's - it's very	yes
6972	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	O_K, it's - it's very	no
6973	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	eh - it's  very brief, I mean - just let me - just hand these out. Oops.	no
6974	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Is this the same as the email or different?	no
6975	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	It's slightly different. I -	no
6976	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Thanks.	no
6977	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	O_K.	no
6978	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	basically  the same.	no
6979	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Same idea?	no
6980	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	But, same idea. So, if you've looked at this you've seen it before, so  Basically,  um	no
6981	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	as you know, uh	no
6982	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	part of the encoding	no
6983	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	includes a mark that indicates  an overlap.	no
6984	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	It's not indicated	no
6985	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	with, um  uh, tight  precision,  it's just indicated that -	no
6986	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	O_K, so,	no
6987	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	It's indicated to - to - so the people know	no
6988	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	what  parts of sp-	no
6989	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	which - which stretches of speech were in the  clear,	no
6990	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	versus being overlapped by others. So, I	no
6991	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	used this mark and, um	no
6992	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and, uh  uh,	no
6993	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	divided the -	no
6994	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I wrote a script	no
6995	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	which divides things into individual minutes,	no
6996	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	of which we ended up with forty  five, and a little bit.	no
6997	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And, uh	no
6998	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	you know, minute zero, of course, is the first minute up to	no
6999	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	sixty seconds.	no
7000	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	O_K .	no
7001	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And, um	no
7002	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	What you can see is the number of overlaps	no
7003	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and then	no
7004	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	to the right,	no
7005	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	whether they involve  two  speakers,  three  speakers, or  more  than three speakers.	no
7006	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And,	no
7007	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	um  and,	no
7008	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	what I was looking for sp- sp- specifically  was  the question of	no
7009	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	whether they're distributed  evenly  throughout or whether they're	no
7010	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	bursts  of them.	no
7011	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Um.	no
7012	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And  it looked to me as though -	no
7013	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	uh, you know - y- this is just -	no
7014	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	eh - eh, this would - this is  not  statistically	no
7015	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	verified,	no
7016	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	but it	no
7017	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	did  look to me as though there are bursts  throughout,  rather than being	no
7018	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	localized to a particular region.	no
7019	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	The  part  down there, where there's the  maximum  number of -	no
7020	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	of, um  overlaps is an area where we were discussing	no
7021	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	whether or not it would be useful to indi- to s- to	no
7022	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	code	no
7023	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	stress,	no
7024	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	uh,  sentence  stress	no
7025	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	as possible indication of, uh   information  retrieval.	no
7026	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So it's like,	no
7027	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	you know, rather,	no
7028	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	lively discussion there.	no
7029	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	What was - what's the - the  parenthesized  stuff  that says, like -	no
7030	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Oh, th-	no
7031	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	e-  the first one that says  six  overlaps and then  two  point eight?	no
7032	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	That's the per  cent.	no
7033	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mmm.	no
7034	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So,  six  is, uh  two point eight percent  of the total number of overlaps in the  session.	no
7035	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
7036	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Ah.	no
7037	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
7038	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	At the very end,	no
7039	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	this is when people were,	no
7040	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	you know, packing up to go basically, there's	no
7041	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	this  final  stuff, I think we -	no
7042	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I don't remember  where  the digits  fell. I'd have to look at that. But	no
7043	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	the final three there are no overlaps at all.	no
7044	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And  couple times there  are not. So, i- it seems like it goes through bursts	no
7045	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
7046	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	but, um  that's kind of it. Now,	no
7047	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
7048	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Another  question is	no
7049	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	is there - are there	no
7050	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	individual differences in whether you're likely to  be  overlapped  with  or to overlap with  others.	no
7051	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And, again  I want to emphasize this is just one  particular	no
7052	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	um -	no
7053	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	one particular meeting, and also there's been no statistical  testing  of it all, but	no
7054	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I, um	no
7055	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I took the coding of	no
7056	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	the - I, you know, my - I had this script	no
7057	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	figure out, um	no
7058	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	who	no
7059	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	was the first speaker, who was the second speaker involved in a two-person overlap, I didn't look at the ones involving three or more.	no
7060	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And, um	no
7061	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	this is how it breaks down in the individual cells of	no
7062	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	who tended to be overlapping most often with who -	no
7063	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	who else, and	no
7064	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	if you look at the  marginal  totals, which is the ones on the right side and across the bottom, you get	no
7065	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	the totals for an  individual.  So,	no
7066	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	um  If you	no
7067	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	look at the  bottom,  those are the, um	no
7068	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	numbers of overlaps in which	no
7069	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	um  Adam was involved as the person doing the overlapping and if you look -	no
7070	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I'm sorry, but you're o- alphabetical, that's why I'm choosing you	no
7071	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And then if you look across the  right,	no
7072	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	then  that's where he was the	no
7073	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	person who was the sp- first  speaker  in the pair	no
7074	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and got overlap-	no
7075	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Hmm!	no
7076	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	overlapped  with by somebody.	no
7077	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
7078	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And,  then if you look down in the  summary  table,	no
7079	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	then you see that, um	no
7080	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	th- they're differences in	no
7081	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	whether a person got overlapped  with  or	no
7082	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	overlapped	no
7083	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Is this uh  just raw  counts  or is it -	no
7084	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	by.	no
7085	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Raw counts.	no
7086	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So it would be interesting to see	no
7087	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	how much each person  spoke.	no
7088	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
7089	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yes,	no
7090	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah	no
7091	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
7092	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	very  true - very true  it would be good to normalize with respect to that. Now on the table I did	no
7093	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Normalized to how much -	no
7094	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah	no
7095	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	take one step toward, uh   away  from the raw frequencies by putting,	no
7096	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	uh   percentages.  So that the percentage of time	no
7097	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	of the - of the times that a person spoke,	no
7098	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	what percentage	no
7099	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	eh, w- so.	no
7100	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Of the times a person spoke  and  furthermore was involved in a two- two-person overlap,	no
7101	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	what percentage of the time were they the  overlapper  and what percent of the time were they th- the  overlappee?	no
7102	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And  there,  it looks like you see some  differences,	no
7103	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	um,	no
7104	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	that some people tend to be overlapped	no
7105	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	with  more often than they're  overlapped,  but, of course,	no
7106	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	uh i- e-  this is just  one  meeting,	no
7107	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	uh  there's  no  statistical testing involved, and that would be	no
7108	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	required for a - for a  finding   of  any  kind of	no
7109	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	S- so, i- it would be  statistically  incorrect to conclude from this that Adam talked too much or something.	no
7110	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	scientific  reliability.	no
7111	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	No - no actually, that would be  actually  statistically  correct,  but	no
7112	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	No, no, no.	no
7113	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah, yeah.	no
7114	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah, yeah.	no
7115	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah, yeah.	no
7116	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah, that's right.	no
7117	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	That's right. And I'm  you know, I'm - I don't see a point of singling people out,	no
7118	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
7119	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Excuse me.	no
7120	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	now,  this  is a case where obviously -	no
7121	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	B- I - I -  I  rather  enjoyed  it, but - but  this	no
7122	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	But the numbers speak for themselves.	no
7123	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	He's - Yeah, yeah, yeah.	no
7124	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Well,  you know, it's like - I'm not - I'm not	no
7125	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yes, that's right, so you don't nee-  O_K.	no
7126	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	saying on the tape who did	no
7127	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	better or worse because  I don't think that it's - I	no
7128	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Sure.	no
7129	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	you know, and - and th- here's a case where of course, human subjects people would say be sure that you anonymize the results,  and - and, so, might as well do this.	no
7130	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah, when - this is what -	no
7131	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
7132	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	This is actually - when Jane sent this email  first,  is what caused me to start  thinking  about	no
7133	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	anonymizing  the  data.	no
7134	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Well, fair enough.  Fair enough.	no
7135	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And actually,  you know, the point is  not  about an individual, it's the point about  tendencies toward	no
7136	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
7137	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	you know, different  styles,  different speaker styles.	no
7138	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Oh  sure.	no
7139	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And  it would be, you know  of course,	no
7140	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	there's also the question of what type of overlap	no
7141	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	was  this, and w- what were they, and	no
7142	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	i- and I - and I  know  that I can distinguish at least three types and, probably more, I mean, the	no
7143	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	general	no
7144	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	cultural idea which w- uh, the  conversation  analysts originally started with in the  seventies  was that we have this  strict model where politeness involves that you let the person finish th- before you start talking, and	no
7145	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and you know, I mean,	no
7146	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	w- we know that -	no
7147	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	an- and they've loosened up on that too s- in the intervening time, that	no
7148	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	that that's - that's	no
7149	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	viewed as being	no
7150	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	a culturally- relative  thing, I mean,  that you have the high-involvement style from the East  Coast  where people	no
7151	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	will overlap  often  as an indication of  interest  in what the other person is  saying.	no
7152	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Uh-huh.	no
7153	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And	no
7154	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah,  exactly!  Well, there you go. Fine, that's alright, that's O_K.	no
7155	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Exactly!	no
7156	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah	no
7157	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And - and,	no
7158	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	you know, in contrast, so Deborah - d- and also Deborah Tannen's  thesis she talked about differences of these types,  that they're just different  styles,  and it's um	no
7159	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	you - you can't  impose  a model of -	no
7160	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	there - of the ideal being no overlaps, and	no
7161	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	you know, conversational analysts  also  agree with that, so it's	no
7162	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	now, universally	no
7163	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	a- ag-  agreed  with.	no
7164	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And - and, als- I mean,	no
7165	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I can't  say  universally,	no
7166	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	but anyway, the people who used to say it was strict,	no
7167	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	um  now, uh	no
7168	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	don't.  I mean they - they   also	no
7169	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	you know, uh  uh,	no
7170	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	ack- acknowledge the influence of	no
7171	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	sub- of subcultural norms and	no
7172	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	cross-cultural norms and things.	no
7173	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So, um	no
7174	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Then it beco-	no
7175	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	though - so - just - just superficially to give	no
7176	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	um  a couple ideas of the  types  of overlaps involved, I have at the bottom several that  I  noticed. So,	no
7177	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	uh, there are backchannels, like what Adam just did now and, um	no
7178	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	um, anticipating the end of a  question	no
7179	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and  simply answering it earlier, and there are several of those in this - in these data where -	no
7180	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
7181	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	because we're	no
7182	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	people who've talked to each other,	no
7183	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	um  we know	no
7184	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	basically what the topic is, what the possibilities are and w- and we've spoken with each other so we know basically what the other person's  style  is likely to be and so	no
7185	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and t- there are a number of places where someone just answered  early.	no
7186	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	No problem.	no
7187	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And places  also	no
7188	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	which I thought were interesting, where two or  more  people gave exactly th- the same answer in unison - different words of course but you know, the - basically,	no
7189	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	you know	no
7190	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	"everyone's saying ""yes"" or - you know, or"	no
7191	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	ev- even more sp-  specific  than that.	no
7192	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So, uh, the point is that, um	no
7193	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	overlap's not necessarily a bad  thing  and that it would be im-	no
7194	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	i- useful to subdivide these further and see if there are individual differences in styles with respect to the types involved.	no
7195	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And that's all I wanted to say on that,	no
7196	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	unless  people have questions.	no
7197	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Well, of course th- the biggest,  um	no
7198	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	result here, which is one we've -	no
7199	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yep.	no
7200	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	we've talked about many times and isn't  new  to us, but which I think would be interesting to show someone who  isn't  familiar with this	no
7201	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	is just the sheer number of  overlaps.	no
7202	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yes, yes!	no
7203	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Oh, O_K - interesting.	no
7204	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	That - that -	no
7205	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
7206	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Right?	no
7207	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	that - that, um	no
7208	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	here's a relatively short meeting, it's a forty -	no
7209	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	forty plus minute	no
7210	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Hundred ninety-seven.	no
7211	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	meeting, and  not  only were there two hundred and fifteen  overlaps	no
7212	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	but,	no
7213	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	uh	no
7214	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I think there's one -	no
7215	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	one minute there where there - where - where there wasn't any overlap? I mean, it's -	no
7216	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	S- n- are -	no
7217	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	uh throughout this thing?	no
7218	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Well, at the bottom, you have the bottom three.	no
7219	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	It's -	no
7220	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	It'd be interesting -	no
7221	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
7222	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So four - four minutes all together with  none   - none.	no
7223	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	You have -	no
7224	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	@@	no
7225	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Oh, so the bottom three  did  have s- stuff going on?	no
7226	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	But it w-	no
7227	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yes, uh-huh. Yeah. But just no overlaps.	no
7228	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	There  was  speech?	no
7229	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	O_K, so  if - the - this  -	no
7230	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	It'd be  interesting  to see what the total amount of  time  is in the overlaps,	no
7231	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	versus -	no
7232	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yes, exactly and that's - that's where Jose's  pro-   project comes in.	no
7233	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I was about to ask -	no
7234	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah, yeah,	no
7235	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
7236	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
7237	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I h- I have this- that infor- I have th- that information	no
7238	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Hmm.	no
7239	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	now.	no
7240	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Oh, about how much  is  it?	no
7241	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	The - the  duration  of eh - of each of the overlaps.	no
7242	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	O- oh, what's - what's the - what's the average	no
7243	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	length?	no
7244	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	M- I - I haven't averaged it now but, uh  I - I will, uh	no
7245	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	You don't know?	no
7246	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I will do the - the study of the -  with the - with the program with the - uh, the different, uh  the, nnn,  distribution of the duration of the overlaps.	no
7247	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	O_K, you - you don- you don't have a feeling for roughly how  much it is? Yeah.	no
7248	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	mmm,  Because the - the uh,  @@  is  @@ .	no
7249	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	The duration is, uh  the variation - the variation of the duration is uh, very big	no
7250	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
7251	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
7252	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	on the dat-	no
7253	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I suspect that it will also differ,	no
7254	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	but eh -	no
7255	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	depending on the  type  of overlap  involved.  So backchannels will be very brief and -	no
7256	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
7257	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Oh,  I'm sure.	no
7258	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Because, on your  surface  eh  a bit of zone of overlapping with the duration	no
7259	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	eh,  overlapped  and another very very short.	no
7260	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
7261	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
7262	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	"Uh, i- probably it's very difficult to - to - because the - the overlap is, uh on- is only the - in the final ""S_"""	no
7263	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	of the - of the - the fin- the - the end - the end word of the, um  previous speaker	no
7264	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
7265	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	with the - the next word of the - the new speaker.	no
7266	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	"Um, I considered  that's an overlap but it's very short, it's an ""X_"" with a -"	no
7267	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and - the idea is probably, eh  when eh - when eh, we studied th- th- that zone, eh	no
7268	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	eh, we h- we have eh eh  confusion with eh eh noise.	no
7269	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
7270	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	With eh  that  fricative  sounds, but uh  I have  new  information but I have to - to  study .	no
7271	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
7272	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah, but I - I'd -	no
7273	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Can I -	no
7274	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	u-   go ahead .	no
7275	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
7276	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	You split this by minute, um  so if an overlap	no
7277	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yes.	no
7278	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	straddles  the boundary between two minutes, that counts towards  both  of those minutes.	no
7279	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
7280	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Actually, um	no
7281	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	um  actually  not.	no
7282	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Uh, so  le- let's think about the case where	no
7283	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	A_ starts speaking	no
7284	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and then B_ overlaps with A_,	no
7285	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and then the minute boundary happens.	no
7286	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And let's say that	no
7287	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	after that minute boundary,	no
7288	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	um  B_ is still speaking,	no
7289	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and A_ overlaps	no
7290	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	with B_,	no
7291	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	that would be a new overlap.	no
7292	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	But  otherwise	no
7293	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	um, let's say B_	no
7294	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	comes to the conclusion of - of that turn without	no
7295	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	anyone overlapping with him or her,	no
7296	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	in which case there would be no overlap counted in that second minute.	no
7297	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	No, but suppose they both	no
7298	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	talk simultaneously	no
7299	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	both a - a  portion  of it is in minute one and another portion of minute two.	no
7300	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	O_K. In that case, um	no
7301	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	my c-	no
7302	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	the coding that I was using -	no
7303	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	since we haven't,  uh  incorporated Adam's, uh  coding of overlap  yets,   the coding of	no
7304	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	"Yeah, ""yets"" is not a word."	no
7305	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Uh	no
7306	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	since we haven't incorporated Adam's method of handling overl- overlaps yet	no
7307	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	um  then  that would have fallen through the cra- cracks. It would be an underestimate of the number of overlaps because, um  I wou- I wouldn't be able to pick it up from the way it was	no
7308	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	encoded so far.	no
7309	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	We just haven't done th- the precise second to sec- you know,	no
7310	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I- I-	no
7311	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	second to second coding of  when  they occur.	no
7312	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I- I-	no
7313	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I'm - I'm - I'm confused now. So l- l- let me restate what I  thought  Andreas was saying and - and see.	no
7314	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Uh-huh.	no
7315	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Let's say that in - in second fifty-seven	no
7316	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yep.	no
7317	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	of one minute,	no
7318	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	you start talking and I start talking	no
7319	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	O_K.	no
7320	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and  we ignore each other and keep on talking for six seconds.	no
7321	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
7322	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So we go over - So we were - we were  talking  over one another,	no
7323	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and it's just -	no
7324	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	in  each  case, it's just sort of one  interval.	no
7325	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Right?	no
7326	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm?	no
7327	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So, um  we talked  over  the minute boundary.	no
7328	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Is this  considered as one overlap in each of the minutes, the way you have  done  this.	no
7329	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	No,  it  wouldn't.	no
7330	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	It would be considered as an overlap in the  first  one.	no
7331	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	O_K, so that's	no
7332	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	good,  i- I think, in the sense that I think Andreas  meant  the question, right?	no
7333	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	That's -  that's good, yeah, cuz the overall rate is -	no
7334	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
7335	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	@@	no
7336	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Statistical.	no
7337	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
7338	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm. Yeah. They're  not  double  counted.	no
7339	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yep.	no
7340	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Other- otherwise you'd get  double  counts, here and there.	no
7341	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
7342	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Ah but,	no
7343	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	yeah.	no
7344	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	@@	no
7345	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And then it would be  harder  -	no
7346	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
7347	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
7348	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I should also say I did a simplifying, uh  count in that	no
7349	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	if A_ was speaking	no
7350	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	B_ overlapped with A_ and then A_ came  back  again and overlapped with  B_  again,	no
7351	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I - I didn't count that as a  three-person  overlap, I counted that as a  two-person  overlap,	no
7352	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
7353	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and it was  A_  being overlapped with by  D_ .	no
7354	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Because the idea was the  first  speaker	no
7355	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	had the floor	no
7356	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and the  second  person	no
7357	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	started speaking and then the f- the first person reasserted the floor  kind of thing.	no
7358	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	These are simplifying assumptions, didn't happen very often, there may be like three overlaps affected that way in the whole thing.	no
7359	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
7360	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I want to go back and listen to minute forty-one.	no
7361	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah, yeah.	no
7362	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Cuz i- i- I find it  interesting  that there were a large number of  overlaps  and they were  all   two-speaker.	no
7363	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
7364	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I mean what I  thought  - what I	no
7365	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	would have  thought  in	no
7366	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	That's interesting.	no
7367	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	is that when there were a  large  number of  overlaps,  it was because  everyone  was talking at  once,	no
7368	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	That's  interesting.	no
7369	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
7370	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
7371	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	but uh	no
7372	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	apparently  not.  That's really  neat.	no
7373	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mmm.	no
7374	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah, there's a lot of backchannel, a lot o- a lot of -	no
7375	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
7376	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	This  is  really interesting data.	no
7377	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah, it  is.  I think so too, I think -	no
7378	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I  think  what's really interesting though, it is	no
7379	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	before d-	no
7380	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	"saying "" yes,  meetings have a lot of  overlaps "" is to actually"	no
7381	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	find out  how  many  more	no
7382	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	we have than  two-party.	no
7383	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Cuz in  two-party  conversations, like  Switchboard,  there's an  awful  lot too if you just look at	no
7384	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	backchannels,  if you consider those overlaps?	no
7385	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	it's also ver- it's huge.	no
7386	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	It's just that people haven't been	no
7387	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	looking  at that because they've been doing  single-channel  processing for	no
7388	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
7389	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm?	no
7390	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	speech  recognition.	no
7391	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So, the question is, you know, how many more overlaps	no
7392	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	do you  have	no
7393	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	of, say the  two-person  type, by adding more  people.	no
7394	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	to a  meeting,	no
7395	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and it  may  be a lot more but i- it may -	no
7396	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	it may  not  be.	no
7397	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Well, but see, I find it interesting even if it  wasn't  any more,	no
7398	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So.	no
7399	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	because	no
7400	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	since we  were  dealing with this full duplex sort of thing in Switchboard where it was just all separated  out	no
7401	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	we just - everything was just  nice,  so that - so the issue is in - in a situation	no
7402	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm?	no
7403	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	"Well, it's  not  really  "" nice ""."	no
7404	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	where th- that's -	no
7405	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	It depends what you're  doing.	no
7406	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So if you were actually	no
7407	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	having, uh -	no
7408	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	depends what you're doing,	no
7409	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	if -	no
7410	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Right now we're do- we have  individual   mikes on the people in this meeting.	no
7411	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm?	no
7412	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So the question is, you know -	no
7413	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	"""are there really more overlaps  happening"	no
7414	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	"than there would be in a  two-person    party ""."	no
7415	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Let -	no
7416	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	let m-	no
7417	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And - and there well may  be,  but -	no
7418	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	let me rephrase what I'm saying	no
7419	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	cuz I don't think I'm getting it across.	no
7420	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	What -	no
7421	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	what I - what -	no
7422	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	"I shouldn't use words like "" nice "" because maybe that's too - i- too imprecise."	no
7423	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	But what I  mean  is	no
7424	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	that, um  in   Switchboard,	no
7425	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	despite the many -  many  other problems that we have, one problem that we're  not  considering is overlap.	no
7426	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And what we're doing  now  is,	no
7427	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	aside from the many  other  differences in the  task,  we  are  considering overlap	no
7428	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and  one  of the reasons that we're  considering  it,	no
7429	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	you know,  one  of them	no
7430	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	not  all  of them,  one  of them  is	no
7431	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	that w- uh at least,	no
7432	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	you know  I'm  very interested in	no
7433	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	the scenario in which, uh	no
7434	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	both people talking are pretty much equally   audible,	no
7435	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and from a single  microphone.	no
7436	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And so,	no
7437	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	in that case, it  does  get mixed in,	no
7438	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and it's pretty hard to jus-	no
7439	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	to just  ignore  it, to just do processing on  one  and not on the  other.	no
7440	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I - I agree that it's an issue here	no
7441	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	but it's  also  an issue for  Switchboard  and if you	no
7442	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	think of meetings	no
7443	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	being recorded over the telephone, which I think,	no
7444	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
7445	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	you know, this  whole   point  of  studying   meetings  isn't just to have people in a  room  but to also have	no
7446	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	meetings  over different  phone  lines.	no
7447	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Maybe far field  mike  people wouldn't be interested in that but all the  dialogue  issues still apply,	no
7448	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
7449	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	so if each of us was calling and having	no
7450	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	a meeting  that  way	no
7451	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	you kn- you know like a  conference  call.	no
7452	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And, just the question is,	no
7453	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	y- you know, in  Switchboard	no
7454	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	you would  think  that's the  simplest   case  of a  meeting	no
7455	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
7456	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	of more than one person, and	no
7457	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I'm  wondering  how much more  overlap	no
7458	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	of	no
7459	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	the types that - that Jane  described  happen with more  people  present.	no
7460	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So it may be that having  three  people	no
7461	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	is  very  different from having two people or it may  not  be.	no
7462	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	That's an  important  question to ask. I think what I'm -	no
7463	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So.	no
7464	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	All I'm s- really saying is that I don't think we were  considering  that in Switchboard.	no
7465	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Not you,  me.	no
7466	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	But uh -	no
7467	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Were you?	no
7468	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Though it wasn't   in  the  design.	no
7469	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	but -	no
7470	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	but	no
7471	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Were you - were you - were you - were you measuring it?	no
7472	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I mean, w- w- were -	no
7473	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	There - there's	no
7474	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	actually	no
7475	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	to tell you the truth, the reason why it's hard to measure is because	no
7476	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	of	no
7477	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	so, from the point of view of studying  dialogue,  I mean, which  Dan Jurafsky and Andreas and I had some projects on,	no
7478	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
7479	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	you want to know the  sequence  of turns.	no
7480	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So what happens is if  you're  talking and I have a backchannel in the middle of your turn,	no
7481	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
7482	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and then you keep going	no
7483	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	what it  looks  like in a dialogue model is  your  turn and then my  backchannel,	no
7484	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	even though my backchannel occurred completely  inside  your turn.	no
7485	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah?	no
7486	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So, for things like language modeling or dialogue modeling	no
7487	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	it's -	no
7488	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	We  know  that that's  wrong	no
7489	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah?	no
7490	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	in real time.	no
7491	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	But,  because	no
7492	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	of	no
7493	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	the  acoustic   segmentations  that were done and the fact that  some  of the acoustic data in  Switchboard  were  missing,	no
7494	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	people couldn't  study  it,	no
7495	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	but that doesn't mean in the real  world  that people don't  talk  that way.	no
7496	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah, I wasn't  saying  that.	no
7497	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So,	no
7498	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Right? I was just saying that w-  now  we're  looking  at it.	no
7499	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	it's -	no
7500	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	um	no
7501	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And - and - and, you - you maybe  wanted  to look at it before but, for these various technical reasons in terms of how the  data  was you  weren't.	no
7502	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Well, we've als-	no
7503	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Right. We're  looking  at it  here.	no
7504	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So that's why it's coming to us as  new	no
7505	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	even though it may well  be	no
7506	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	you know, if your - if your hypothes- The hypothesis you were offering	no
7507	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Um.	no
7508	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	eh - Right? -	no
7509	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	if it's the  null  poth-  hypothesis,	no
7510	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and if actually you have as  much  overlap in a two-person,	no
7511	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	we  don't  know the  answer  to that.	no
7512	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	The reason we  don't  know the  answer  to is cuz it wasn't  studied	no
7513	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and it wasn't  studied  because it wasn't set  up.   Right?	no
7514	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah, all I meant is	no
7515	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	that	no
7516	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	if you're asking the question from the point of view of	no
7517	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	what's different about a  meeting,	no
7518	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm?	no
7519	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	studying  meetings  of, say, more than two  people  versus	no
7520	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	what	no
7521	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	kinds of questions you could ask with a  two-person   meeting.	no
7522	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	It's  important   to distinguish	no
7523	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	that, you know, this project	no
7524	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	is getting a lot of overlap	no
7525	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	but  other  projects were too,	no
7526	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	but we just couldn't  study  them.	no
7527	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	May  have been.	no
7528	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And  and so uh	no
7529	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	May  have been. Right?	no
7530	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	We do kn- we don't know the numbers.	no
7531	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Well,	no
7532	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	there  is  a high  rate,	no
7533	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So.	no
7534	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	It's - but I don't know  how  high,	no
7535	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	in fact	no
7536	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Well, here-	no
7537	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I  have a question.	no
7538	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	that would be	no
7539	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	See, I mean, i- i- le- let me t-	no
7540	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	interesting to know.	no
7541	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	"I mean, my point was just if you wanted to say to somebody, "" what  have we learned about  overlaps  here?"""	no
7542	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	just never mind comparison with something else,	no
7543	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
7544	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	what we've learned about is  overlaps  in this situation, is that - the first -	no
7545	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	the  first-order  thing I would say is that there's a  lot  of them.	no
7546	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
7547	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Right?	no
7548	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	In - in the sense that i- if you said	no
7549	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah,	no
7550	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	if - i- i- i-	no
7551	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I - I don't di-	no
7552	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	In a way, I guess what I'm comparing to is more the	no
7553	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I	no
7554	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	agree with	no
7555	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	that.	no
7556	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	common  sense  notion of	no
7557	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	how - how much people  overlap.	no
7558	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Uh  you know the fact that when - when - when, uh, Adam was looking for a stretch of - of speech before, that didn't have any overlaps, and he w- he was having such a hard time	no
7559	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	"and now I look at  this  and I go, ""well, I can  see  why he was having such a hard time"". It's  happening  a  lot."	no
7560	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Right.	no
7561	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	That's also true of  Switchboard.	no
7562	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	It may not be -	no
7563	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I wasn't saying it  wasn't.	no
7564	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Right.  So it's just,	no
7565	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Right?	no
7566	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	um	no
7567	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I was commenting about  this.	no
7568	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	O_K.	no
7569	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I'm saying if  I  -	no
7570	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	All I'm saying is that from the	no
7571	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I'm saying if I  have  this complicated thing in  front  of me,	no
7572	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and we sh- which,  you know we're gonna get	no
7573	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	much  more sophisticated about when we get  lots  more  data,	no
7574	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	But - Then, if I was gonna describe to somebody what did you learn	no
7575	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	"right here, about, you know, the - the modest amount of data that was  analyzed  I'd say, ""Well, the  first-order   thing  was there was a  lot  of  overlaps ""."	no
7576	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	In fact -	no
7577	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and it's  not  just an overlap -	no
7578	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	bunch of overlaps -  second-order  thing is	no
7579	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	it's  not  just a bunch of overlaps in  one  particular  point,	no
7580	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Right.	no
7581	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	but that there's overlaps, uh  throughout  the thing.	no
7582	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And that's  interesting.    That's  all.	no
7583	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Right.	no
7584	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	No, I - I agree with that.	no
7585	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I'm just	no
7586	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	saying that it may -	no
7587	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	the  reason  you get overlaps may or may not be due to sort of the  number  of people in the meeting.	no
7588	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Oh  yeah.	no
7589	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
7590	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And	no
7591	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah, I wasn't making any  statement  about  that.	no
7592	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	that's all.	no
7593	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And - and it would actually be interesting to find  out  because	no
7594	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
7595	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	some of the	no
7596	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	data say Switchboard, which isn't exactly the same kind of context, I mean these are two people who  don't  know each other and so forth,	no
7597	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	But we should  still  be able to	no
7598	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	somehow	no
7599	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	say what - what is the  added   contra- contribution to sort of overlap	no
7600	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	time	no
7601	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	of each additional person, or something like that.	no
7602	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yep. I could  certainly   see  it going  either   way.	no
7603	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	O_K, now.	no
7604	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah, that would be good to know, but w- we -	no
7605	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	What -	no
7606	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Wh- yeah, I - I agree - I agree with Adam. And the reason is because I think there's a limit -	no
7607	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	But yeah.	no
7608	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
7609	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	there's an upper  bound	no
7610	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	on how many you can have,  simply	no
7611	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	from the standpoint of  audibility.  When we  speak  we - we  do  make a judgment of	no
7612	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
7613	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Right.	no
7614	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	"""can -"""	no
7615	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	you know, as  adults.   I mean, children don't  adjust  so well,	no
7616	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I mean, if a truck	no
7617	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	goes rolling past,	no
7618	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	adults will	no
7619	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
7620	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	well, depending, but  mostly,  adults will - will -	no
7621	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	will hold off to what -	no
7622	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	to finish the end of the sentence till the - till the  noise  is past. And I think we generally  do	no
7623	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	monitor  things like that,	no
7624	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	about - whether we - whether our utterance will be in the clear or not.	no
7625	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Right.	no
7626	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And partly it's related to  rhythmic  structure in conversation, so,	no
7627	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	you know, you - you t-	no
7628	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah, this is d- also um,	no
7629	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	people  tend  to  time  their - their -	no
7630	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Well -	no
7631	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	their, um	no
7632	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	when they  come into the conversation based on the overall rhythmic,  uh	no
7633	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Right.	no
7634	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	uh, ambient thing.	no
7635	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So you  don't  want to be c- cross-cutting.	no
7636	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And -	no
7637	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and, just to finish this,	no
7638	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	that um	no
7639	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	That I think that	no
7640	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	there may be an upper bound on  how  many overlaps you can have,  simply  from the standpoint of audibility and how loud the other people are who are already	no
7641	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	in the	no
7642	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	fray.	no
7643	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	But I - you know,	no
7644	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	of certain  types.	no
7645	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Now if it's just  backchannels,	no
7646	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	people	no
7647	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	may be doing  that	no
7648	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	with less   intention  of being heard,	no
7649	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	just sort of spontaneously doing  backchannels,	no

7651	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	that -  those  might -	no
7652	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	there may be  no  upper bound on  those.	no
7653	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I - I have a  feeling  that backchannels, which are	no
7654	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	the vast majority of overlaps in  Switchboard,	no
7655	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	uh, don't play as big a role  here,  because it's very  unnatural	no
7656	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I think, to backchannel if - in a multi-audience -	no
7657	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	you know, in a multi-person	no
7658	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	If you can  see  them, actually.	no
7659	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	audience.	no
7660	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	It's interesting, so if you watch people are going like -	no
7661	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Right.	no
7662	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Right  - right, like this  here,  but	no

7671	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no

7674	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	in this	no

7687	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	so you  need  to use the  backchannel.	no
7688	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Your mike is -	no
7689	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So, in the  two-person  conversations,	no
7690	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	when there's  backchannel,	no
7691	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	is there a great deal of	no
7692	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	That  is  an earphone, so if you just put it  so it's on your ear.	no
7693	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	overlap	no
7694	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	in the speech? or -	no
7695	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Cuz my  impression  is sometimes	no
7696	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	There you go.	no
7697	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yes.	no
7698	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
7699	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Thank you.	no
7700	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	E- for example.	no
7701	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	it happens when there's a  pause,	no
7702	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	you know, like you - you	no
7703	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yes.	no
7704	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	get a lot of backchannel, when somebody's  pausing	no
7705	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Right.	no
7706	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	She's  doing that.	no
7707	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Sorry, what were you saying?	no
7708	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	It's  hard  to do both, huh?	no
7709	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Um	no
7710	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	no, when - when - when there's  backchannel,  I mean, just -	no
7711	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Oh.	no
7712	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I was just  listening,  and -	no
7713	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and when there's  two  people talking and there's  backchannel  it seems like,	no
7714	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	um the  backchannel   happens  when, you know, the  pitch  drops and the first person -	no
7715	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and a  lot  of times, the first person actually  stops  talking and then there's a backchannel	no
7716	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and then they start  up  again, and so I'm wondering about -	no
7717	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	h-	no
7718	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I just wonder how much overlap there is.	no
7719	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Is there a lot?	no
7720	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I  think  there's a  lot  of the kind that  Jose  was talking about, where -	no
7721	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	"I mean, this is called ""precision timing"" in  conversation analysis,"	no
7722	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	where	no
7723	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	they come in	no
7724	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	overlapping,	no
7725	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	but at a point where	no
7726	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	the	no
7727	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	information is mostly	no
7728	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	complete.	no
7729	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So all you're missing is some last syllables or something or the last word or some highly predictable words.	no
7730	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mmm.	no
7731	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
7732	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So  technically,  it's an overlap.	no
7733	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	But	no
7734	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	But maybe a - just a  small  overlap?	no
7735	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	you know, from  information  flow point of view it's not an overlap in  the predictable information.	no
7736	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	More, yeah.	no
7737	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	It'd be  interesting  if we could do  prediction.	no
7738	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I was just thinking more in terms of  alignment,	no
7739	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	alignment  overlap.	no
7740	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
7741	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Language  model prediction of  overlap,  that would be  really   interesting.	no
7742	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So -  so -	no
7743	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
7744	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Well, that's  exactly,   exactly   why  we wanted to study the precise timing of overlaps ins- in	no
7745	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Right.	no
7746	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Right.	no
7747	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	uh  Switchboard,  say, because there's a lot of that.	no
7748	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So - so  here's  a - here's a first interesting   labeling  task.	no
7749	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
7750	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Uh, to distinguish between, say,  backchannels	no
7751	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	precision timing - Sort of	no
7752	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	you know,  benevolent  overlaps,	no
7753	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and - and -	no
7754	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and w- and -	no
7755	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Let's pick a different word.	no
7756	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and sort of, um  I don't know,  hostile  overlaps, where	no
7757	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	someone is trying to grab the floor from someone else.	no
7758	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
7759	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Uh,  that  - that might be an  interesting,  um   problem  to  look  at.	no
7760	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Hostile takeovers.	no
7761	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
7762	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
7763	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
7764	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Well, I mean you could do that. I ju- I - I think that	no
7765	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
7766	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	in this meeting I  really  had the feeling that wasn't happening, that	no
7767	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	the hostile - hostile type.	no
7768	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	These were - these were	no
7769	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	O_K.	no
7770	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	benevolent types, as people	no
7771	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
7772	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	finishing each other's sentences, and	no
7773	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Um, I could imagine that as - there's a fair number of	no
7774	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	stuff.	no
7775	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	um	no
7776	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	cases where,	no
7777	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and this is sort of, not  really  hostile,  but sort of  competitive,  where	no
7778	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	one  person is  finishing  something and	no
7779	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	you have, like,  two  or  three  people jumping - trying to -	no
7780	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Trying to  get  the floor.	no
7781	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	trying to -	no
7782	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	trying to, uh  grab  the next  turn.	no
7783	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
7784	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And so it's  not  against the person who talks  first	no
7785	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	because actually we're all  waiting  for that person to  finish.	no
7786	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	But they  all  want to  be  next.	no
7787	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I have a  feeling  most of these things are - that -	no
7788	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	that are not	no
7789	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	a benevolent kind are - are	no
7790	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	are, uh	no
7791	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	um	no
7792	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	are - are  competitive  as opposed to real- really -  really  hostile. But.	no
7793	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Right.	no
7794	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah, I agree. I agree.	no
7795	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I wonder what determines who  gets  the floor?	no
7796	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Well, there are  various  things, you - you have the -	no
7797	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I mean -	no
7798	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Uh a vote - vote in Florida.  Yeah.	no
7799	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	It's been studied a  lot.	no
7800	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Voting for -	no
7801	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Um, o- one thing - I - I wanted to -	no
7802	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	or you can tell a good joke and then everybody's laughing and you get a chance to g- break in. But. But.	no
7803	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Seniority.	no
7804	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Um.	no
7805	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	You know, the  other  thing I was thinking was that,  um  these -	no
7806	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	all  these interesting  questions  are, of course, pretty  hard  to  answer  with, uh u-	no
7807	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	you know, a small amount of  data.	no
7808	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	@@	no
7809	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Ach.	no
7810	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So, um  I  wonder  if what you're saying	no
7811	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	suggests that we should make a conscious attempt to have,	no
7812	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	um	no
7813	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	a - a fair number of meetings	no
7814	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	with, uh	no
7815	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	a  smaller  number of people.	no
7816	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Right?	no
7817	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I mean	no
7818	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	we - most of our meetings are	no
7819	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	uh, meetings currently with say five, six, seven, eight people	no
7820	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Should we	no
7821	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	really  try to  have  some two-person meetings,  or some three-person meetings and re- record them	no
7822	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	just to - to - to	no
7823	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	beef up the - the  statistics  on that?	no
7824	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	That's a control.	no
7825	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Well,	no
7826	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	it seems like there are  two  possibilities there, I mean	no
7827	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	i- it seems like	no
7828	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	if you have just	no
7829	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	two  people it's not	no
7830	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	really,	no
7831	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	y- like a  meeting,  w-	no
7832	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	is not as  similar  as the rest of the -	no
7833	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	of the  sample.	no
7834	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	It depends on what you're after, of course, but	no
7835	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	It seems like  that  would be more a case of the  control  condition, compared to, uh  an  experimental	no
7836	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
7837	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	condition, with  more  than two.	no
7838	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Well, Liz was raising the question of - of whether i- it's the number - there's a relationship between the number of people and the number of overlaps or type of overlaps there,	no
7839	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
7840	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and, um	no
7841	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	If you had two people meeting in this kind of circumstance then you'd still have the visuals. You wouldn't have that difference   also  that you have in the	no
7842	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	say, in  Switchboard  data.	no
7843	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
7844	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Uh	no
7845	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah, I'm just thinking that'd be more like a c-  control  condition.	no
7846	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
7847	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
7848	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Well, but from the  acoustic  point of view,	no
7849	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
7850	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	it's all good.	no
7851	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Is the same.	no
7852	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah,  acoustic  is fine, but -	no
7853	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	If - if the goal were to  just  look at  overlap  you would -	no
7854	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	you could serve yourself -  save  yourself a lot of  time  but not even transcri- transcribe the  words.	no
7855	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yep.	no
7856	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Well, I was thinking you  should  be able to do this	no
7857	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	from the   acoustics,  on the  close-talking  mikes, right?	no
7858	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Well, that's - the - that was my - my status report, so	no
7859	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
7860	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Right, I mean Adam was -	no
7861	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	You've been  working  on that.	no
7862	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
7863	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
7864	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	right. I mean, not as well as what - I mean, you wouldn't be able to have any kind of  typology,  obviously, but	no
7865	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Once we're done with  this  stuff  discussing,	no
7866	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
7867	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
7868	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	you'd get some rough statistics.	no
7869	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So.	no
7870	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	But -	no
7871	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	what - what do you think about that?	no
7872	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Do you think that would be useful? I'm just thinking that as an action item of whether we should try to record some two-person meetings or something.	no
7873	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I guess my - my first comment was, um  only that	no
7874	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	um	no
7875	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	we should n- not attribute  overlaps  only to meetings, but maybe that's obvious, maybe	no
7876	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
7877	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	everybody knew that, but that	no
7878	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	in normal	no
7879	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	conversation with two people there's an awful lot of the same kinds of overlap, and that it would be interesting	no
7880	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
7881	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	to	no
7882	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	look at  whether there  are  these kinds of constraints that Jane mentioned, that	no
7883	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	what maybe the  additional  people add to this competition that happens  right  after a turn,	no
7884	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	you know, because now you can have  five  people trying to grab the turn, but pretty quickly	no
7885	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	there're - they back  off  and you go back to this sort of	no
7886	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	only one person at a time with one person	no
7887	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
7888	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	interrupting at a time.	no
7889	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So, I don't know. To answer your question I  it - I don't think it's	no
7890	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	crucial to have	no
7891	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	controls but I think it's worth recording all the meetings we	no
7892	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Can.	no
7893	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	can.	no
7894	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Well,  O_K.	no
7895	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
7896	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So, um	no
7897	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I  -  I  have an idea.	no
7898	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	you know.	no
7899	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	D- I wouldn't  not  record a two-person meeting just because it only has two people.	no
7900	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Right.	no
7901	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Could we -	no
7902	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Could we, um -	no
7903	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	we have - have in the  past  and I think  continue  - will  continue  to have a fair number of  uh  phone  conference calls.	no
7904	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Uh-huh.	no
7905	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah, we  talked  about this repeatedly.	no
7906	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And,	no
7907	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	uh,	no
7908	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and as a -	no
7909	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	to, um	no
7910	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	as another c-  c-  comparison   condition,  we could	no
7911	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	um	no
7912	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	see what - what	no
7913	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	what  happens  in terms of  overlap,  when you  don't  have visual contact.	no
7914	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So, um -	no
7915	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Can we actually record?	no
7916	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	It just seems like that's a very  different   thing than what we're doing.	no
7917	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Uh	no
7918	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I mean   physically   can we  record  the o- the other -	no
7919	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Well, we'll have to set  up  for it.	no
7920	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
7921	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Well, we're not really set up for it	no
7922	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	to do that.	no
7923	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	But.	no
7924	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Or,	no
7925	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
7926	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	this is getting a little  extravagant,	no
7927	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	we could put up	no
7928	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	some kind of	no
7929	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	blinds  or something to -	no
7930	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Barriers!	no
7931	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
7932	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	to remove, uh	no
7933	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	That's what they  did  on Map Task,	no
7934	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	visual  contact.	no
7935	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	you know, this Map Task corpus?	no
7936	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	They ran exactly the same pairs of people with and without	no
7937	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	visual cues and it's quite interesting.	no
7938	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Well, we - we record this meeting so  regularly  it wouldn't be that -	no
7939	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I mean  a little  strange.	no
7940	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	O_K, we can  record,  but  no  one can  look  at each other.	no
7941	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Well, we could just put  b-  blindfolds  on.	no
7942	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
7943	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Well y- no you - f- Yeah, Yeah.	no
7944	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Close  your eyes.	no
7945	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Blindf-	no
7946	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Turn off the  lights.	no
7947	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and we'd take a picture of everybody sitting here with blindfolds.	no
7948	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	That would -	no
7949	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Oh, th-  that  was the  other  thing, weren't we gonna take a picture	no
7950	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	at the beginning of each of these meetings?	no
7951	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Um, what - I had	no
7952	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	thought  we were gonna do is just take pictures of the  whiteboards.	no
7953	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	rather than take pictures of the  meeting.	no
7954	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Well, linguistic -	no
7955	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And, uh -	no
7956	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
7957	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yes.	no
7958	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Linguistic anthropologists would - would suggest it would be useful to	no
7959	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	There's a head nodding here vigorously, yeah.	no
7960	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	also take a picture of the  meeting.	no
7961	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	The -	no
7962	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Why - why do we want to have a picture of the meeting?	no
7963	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Ee-   you mean, transc-	no
7964	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	@@	no
7965	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	because you get then the  spatial  relationship of the  speakers.	no
7966	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	no -	no
7967	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Well, you could do that by just  noting  on the  enrollment  sheet the -	no
7968	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And that	no
7969	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah	no
7970	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	could be	no
7971	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
7972	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
7973	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Seat  number, that's a good idea.	no
7974	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	the  seat  number.	no
7975	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I'll do that. I'll do that on the next set of forms.	no
7976	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
7977	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah. Is possible to get information from the  rhythmic  - f- from the  ge- , eh  uh, files.	no
7978	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So you'd  number  them somehow.	no
7979	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I  finally  remembered to put, uh	no
7980	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	We can - can't you figure it out from the  mike  number?	no
7981	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	put native language on the  newer  forms.	no
7982	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	No.	no
7983	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	O_K.	no
7984	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	The  wireless  ones.	no
7985	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And even the  jacks,  I mean, I'm sitting here and the jack is  over  in front of you.	no
7986	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Oh.	no
7987	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	But  probably  from these you could've  infer it.	no
7988	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah, but	no
7989	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	It would be another  task.	no
7990	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	It's - it would be trivial -	no
7991	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	It would be a research task.	no
7992	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Having - having ground tu- truth would be  nice,  so   seat  number would be good.	no
7993	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah, yeah.	no
7994	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	You know where you could get it?	no
7995	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
7996	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Beam-forming  during the  digit   uh stuff.	no
7997	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So I'm gonna put little  labels  on all the  chairs  with the  seat  number. That's a good idea.	no
7998	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
7999	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Not the  chairs.  The  chairs  are -	no
8000	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	But you have to keep the chairs in the same pla- like here.	no
8001	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	But, uh -	no
8002	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Chairs  are  movable.	no
8003	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Put them -	no
8004	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	The chair-	no
8005	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Like,  put them on the  table  where they -	no
8006	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yep.	no
8007	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
8008	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yep.	no
8009	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
8010	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	But you know, they - the - s-	no
8011	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	the linguistic  anthropologists  would say it would be good to have a digital picture  anyway,  because you get	no
8012	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Just  remembered a  joke.	no
8013	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	a sense also of  posture.	no
8014	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Posture, and we could like,	no
8015	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	What people were  wearing.	no
8016	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
8017	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	you know,	no
8018	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	block out the person's  face  or whatever but -	no
8019	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	The fashion statement.	no
8020	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	but, you know,  these  are  important  cues, I mean the -	no
8021	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Oh,  Andreas  was -	no
8022	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	How big their  heads  are.	no
8023	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	the -	no
8024	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	how a person is sitting  is -	no
8025	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
8026	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	But if you just f-	no
8027	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Andreas  was  wearing  that  same  old  sweater  again.	no
8028	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	But from one picture, I don't know that you really get that. Right?	no
8029	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	You'd want a video for that, I think.	no
8030	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	It'd be better than  nothing,  is - is -	no
8031	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	A video, yeah.	no
8032	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	i- Just from a  single  picture I think you can tell  some  aspects.	no
8033	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Think so?	no
8034	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I mean I - I could  tell  you I mean, if I- if I'm in certain  meetings  I notice that there are certain people who	no
8035	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And -	no
8036	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And -	no
8037	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	really do -	no
8038	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	eh -	no
8039	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	The body language is very uh -	no
8040	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Hmm.	no
8041	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	is very interesting in terms of the dominance aspect.	no
8042	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
8043	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And - and	no
8044	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Morgan  had that  funny   hair  again.	no
8045	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
8046	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Well, I mean you black out the -  that  part. But it's just, you know, the - the body	no
8047	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Hmm.	no
8048	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	He agreed.	no
8049	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	you know?	no
8050	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Of course, the -  where  we sit at the  table,  I find is  very   interesting,  that we do tend to  cong-  to	no
8051	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	gravitate  to the  same   place  each  time.	no
8052	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
8053	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and it's  somewhat   coincidental.  I'm sitting  here  so that I can	no
8054	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	run into the  room  if the  hardware  starts, you know,  catching   fire  or  something.	no
8055	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Oh, no, you - you just like to be in  charge,  that's why you're sitting -	no
8056	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I just want to be at the  head  of the  table.	no
8057	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
8058	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Take control.	no
8059	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Speaking  of taking  control,  you said you had some research  to talk about .	yes
8060	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Speaking  of taking  control,  you said you had some research  to talk about .	no
8061	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
8062	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah, I've been playing with, um	no
8063	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
8064	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	uh, using the  close-talking  mike to do - to  try  to figure out who's  speaking.	no
8065	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So my  first  attempt was just using thresholding and  filtering,  that we talked about - about two weeks ago,	no
8066	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and so I played with that a little bit, and	no
8067	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	it works O_ K,   except that	no
8068	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	it's  very  sensitive to your choice of	no
8069	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	your filter width and your	no
8070	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	threshold.	no
8071	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So if you fiddle around with it a little bit and you get good numbers you can actually do a pretty good job of segmenting when someone's talking and when they're not.	no
8072	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	But if you try to use the same parameters on another  speaker,  it doesn't work anymore,  even if you normalize it based on	no
8073	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	the absolute  loudness.	no
8074	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	But does it work for that one speaker throughout the whole  meeting?	no
8075	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	It  does  work for the one speaker throughout the whole meeting.	no
8076	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Um	no
8077	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Pretty  well.  Pretty  well.	no
8078	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	How did you do it Adam?	no
8079	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	How  did I  do  it? What do you mean?	no
8080	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
8081	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I mean, wh- what was the -	no
8082	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	The algorithm was, uh	no
8083	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
8084	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	take	no
8085	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	o- every frame that's over the threshold,	no
8086	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and then median-filter it,	no
8087	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
8088	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and then look for runs.	no
8089	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So there was a  minimum  run length, so that -	no
8090	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Every frame that's over  what  threshold?	no
8091	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	A  threshold  that you  pick.	no
8092	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	In terms of  energy?	no
8093	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
8094	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Ah!	no
8095	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	O_K.	no
8096	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Say that again?	no
8097	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Frame over fres- threshold.	no
8098	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So you take a - each frame, and you compute the energy and if it's over the threshold you set it to  one,  and if it's under the threshold you set it to  zero,	no
8099	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Hmm.	no
8100	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	so now you have a  bit  stream  of zeros and ones.	no
8101	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	O_K.	no
8102	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And then I  median - filtered  that	no
8103	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	using, um  a fairly long  filter length.	no
8104	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Uh  well, actually I guess depends on what you mean by  long,  you know, tenth of a second sorts of numbers.	no
8105	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Um	no
8106	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and that's to average out	no
8107	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	you know,  pitch,	no
8108	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	you know, the  pitch  contours,	no
8109	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and things like that.	no
8110	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And then, uh	no
8111	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	looked for long runs.	no
8112	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	O_K	no
8113	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And that works O_ K,  if you fil- if you tune the filter parameters, if you tune  how long your median filter is and how high you're looking for your thresholds.	no
8114	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Did you ever try running the filter  before  you pick a threshold?	no
8115	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	No.	no
8116	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I certainly could though.	no
8117	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	But this was just	no
8118	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I  had  the program  mostly  written  already  so it was  easy  to  do.	no
8119	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	O_K and then the  other  thing I did, was I took	no
8120	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Javier's  speaker-change  detector - acoustic- change  detector, and I implemented  that  with the close-talking  mikes,	no
8121	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and   unfortunately  that's not working real well, and it looks like it's -	no
8122	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	the problem is - he does it in two passes, the first pass	no
8123	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	is to find  candidate  places to do a break.	no
8124	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And he does that using a neural net doing broad  phone  classification and he	no
8125	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	has the	no
8126	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	the, uh   one  of the phone classes is silence.	no
8127	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And so the  possible   breaks  are where  silence  starts and ends.	no
8128	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And then he has a  second  pass which is a modeling - a Gaussian mixture model.	no
8129	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Um	no
8130	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	looking for	no
8131	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	uh	no
8132	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	whether it  improves  or - or  degrades  to split  at  one of those particular places.	no
8133	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And what looks like it's  happening  is that the -	no
8134	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	even on the  close-talking  mike	no
8135	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	the broad phone class classifier's doing a really bad job.	no
8136	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Who  was it  trained  on?	no
8137	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Uh, I have no idea. I don't remember.	no
8138	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Hmm.	no
8139	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Does an- do you remember, Morgan, was it Broadcast News?	no
8140	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I think so, yeah.	no
8141	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Um	no
8142	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So, at any rate, my  next  attempt,  which I'm in the  midst  of and haven't quite finished yet was actually using the	no
8143	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	uh,  thresholding	no
8144	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	as the way of generating the candidates.	no
8145	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Because one of the things that  definitely   happens  is if you  put  the threshold  low   you get  lots  of breaks.	no
8146	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	All  of which are  definitely  acoustic events.	no
8147	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	They're  definitely	no
8148	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	someone  talking.	no
8149	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	But, like, it could be someone who isn't the person  here,  but the person over  there  or it can be the person  breathing.	no
8150	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And then feeding  that  into the acoustic change detector.	no
8151	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And so I think  that  might  work.	no
8152	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	But, I haven't gotten very far on that.	no
8153	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	But  all  of this is close-talking mike, so	no
8154	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	it's, uh  just -  just  trying to get some ground truth.	no
8155	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Only with eh	no
8156	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	uh, but eh	no
8157	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I - I - I think, eh	no
8158	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	when - when, y- I -  I saw the - the - the - the speech from P_D_A and, eh  close   talker. I - I think the	no
8159	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	there is a - a great difference in the - in the signal.	no
8160	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Oh,  absolutely.  So  s- my  intention  for  this  is -  is  as an  aide  for ground  truth.	no
8161	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Um	no
8162	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	but eh I -	no
8163	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	not -	no
8164	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	but eh	no
8165	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I - I - I mean that eh eh  in the - in the mixed file	no
8166	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	you can find, uh  zone with, eh	no
8167	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	great different, eh  level of energy.	no
8168	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Um	no
8169	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I - I think for, eh   algorithm based  on energy,	no
8170	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	eh, that um	no
8171	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	h- mmm, - more or less, eh, like eh	no
8172	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	eh, mmm, first sound energy detector.	no
8173	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Say it again?	no
8174	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	eh nnn.	no
8175	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	When y- you the detect the - the - the  first at - at the end  of - of the	no
8176	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	detector of, ehm princ- um. What is the - the name in  English ? the - the, mmm,	no
8177	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	the de- detector of, ehm of a word in the - in the s- in -	no
8178	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	an isolated word	no
8179	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	in - in the  background	no
8180	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I'm - I'm not sure what you're  saying,  can you try -	no
8181	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	That, uh	no
8182	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I mean that when - when you use, eh  eh   any	no
8183	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I think he's saying the  onset  detector.	no
8184	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
8185	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Onset detector, O_K.	no
8186	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I - I think it's probably  to work  well eh, because, eh  you have eh, in the mixed files a  great  level of energy.	no
8187	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	eh  and great difference between the  sp-  speaker.	no
8188	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And probably is not so easy	no
8189	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	when you use the - the P_D_A, eh that -	no
8190	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Right.	no
8191	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Because the signal is, eh  the - in the e- energy level.	no
8192	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	in - in that, eh  eh  speech file  is, eh  more similar.	no
8193	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Right.	no
8194	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	between the different eh, speaker,  um	no
8195	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	But different  speakers.	no
8196	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I - I think is - eh, it will  i- is my opinion.  It will be, eh  more difficult to - to detect	no
8197	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	bass-tone  energy.	no
8198	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	the - the change.	no
8199	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I think that, um  In the P_D_A. Yeah.  Yeah. And the - the another question, that when	no
8200	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Ah, in the clo- in the P_D_ A,  you mean?  Absolutely. Yeah, no  question.  It'll be  much  harder.  Much  harder.	no
8201	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
8202	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I review the - the - the work of Javier. I think the, nnn, the, nnn,  that the idea of using a  neural network	no
8203	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	to - to get a broad class of phonetic, eh  from, eh uh	no
8204	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	a candidate from the - the - the speech signal.	no
8205	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	If you have, eh	no
8206	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	uh, I'm considering, only because Javier, eh  only consider, eh  like candidate, the, nnn, eh  the silence, because it is the - the only model, eh - eh, he used that, eh   eh  nnn,	no
8207	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Right.	no
8208	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	to detect	no
8209	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	the - the possibility of a - a change between the - between the speaker,  Um  another - another research thing, different groups, eh  working, eh  on Broadcast News  prefer to, eh	no
8210	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	to consider hypothesis	no
8211	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	eh  between each phoneme.	no
8212	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
8213	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah, when a   phone  changes.	no
8214	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Because, I - I - I think it's more realistic that, uh  only consider the -  the  the - the silence between the speaker.  Eh  there - there  exists	no
8215	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	eh  silence between - between, eh  a speaker.	no
8216	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	is - is, eh  eh  acoustic, eh	no
8217	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	event, important to - to consider.	no
8218	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
8219	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
8220	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I - I found that the, eh  silence in - in many occasions in the - in the speech file,  but, eh  when you have, eh  eh, two speakers together	no
8221	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	without enough silence between - between  them , eh	no
8222	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I think	no
8223	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	eh  is better to use the acoustic change detector basically and I - I - I	no
8224	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I_X or, mmm,  BIC   criterion for consider all the frames	no
8225	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
8226	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	in my opinion.	no
8227	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah, the - you know, the reason that he, uh  just used silence	no
8228	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	was not because he thought it was  better,	no
8229	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
8230	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	it was - it was - it was the place he was  starting.	no
8231	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yep.	no
8232	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So, he was trying to get something going, and, uh e- e- you know, as - as -	no
8233	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
8234	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.	no
8235	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	as is in  your  case, if you're here for only a modest number of months you try to	no
8236	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
8237	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Do  something.	no
8238	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	pick a realistic goal,	no
8239	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah,	no
8240	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	But his - his goal was always to proceed from there to then allow broad category change also.	no
8241	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	yeah, yeah, yeah.	no
8242	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Uh-huh.	no
8243	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	But, eh  do - do you think that if you consider all the frames	no
8244	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	to apply	no
8245	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	the - the, eh	no
8246	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	the	no
8247	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	BIC   criterion	no
8248	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	to detect the - the - the different acoustic change,  eh  between speaker, without, uh  with, uh  silence or  with overlapping, uh, I think like - like, eh  eh	no
8249	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	a general, eh	no
8250	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	eh  way of process the - the acoustic change.	no
8251	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	In a first step, I mean.	no
8252	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
8253	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
8254	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	An- and then, eh	no
8255	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	eh  without considering the you - you - you, um  you can consider the energy	no
8256	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	like a- another parameter in the - in the feature vector, eh.	no
8257	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Right. Absolutely.	no
8258	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
8259	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	This -  this  is the idea. And if, if you do that, eh  eh, with a  BIC   uh criterion for example, or with another kind of, eh  of  distance  in a first step,  and then you, eh  you get the, eh  the hypothesis	no
8260	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	to the -  this  change acoustic,  eh	no
8261	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	to  po-  process	no
8262	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Right.	no
8263	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Because, eh  eh, probably you - you can find the - the	no
8264	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	eh  a small gap of silence between speaker  with eh  eh  a ga- mmm,	no
8265	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	small duration	no
8266	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
8267	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Less than,  eh  two hundred milliseconds for example  and apply another - another algorithm, another approach like, eh  eh  detector of  ene- , eh detector of  bass-tone  energy to - to consider that, eh	no
8268	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	that, eh  zone.	no
8269	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	of s- a small silence between speaker,  or	no
8270	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	another algorithm to - to process,  eh  the - the segment between marks	no
8271	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
8272	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	eh  founded by the - the	no
8273	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	the  BIC   criterion and applied for - for each frame. I think is, eh	no
8274	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
8275	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	nnn,	no
8276	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	it will be a- an - an - a more general approach	no
8277	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	the  if we compare - with use, eh  a neural net or another, eh  speech recognizer with a broad class or - or narrow class, because, in my opinion	no
8278	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	eh  it's in my opinion,  eh	no
8279	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
8280	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	if you - if you change	no
8281	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	the condition of the speech, I mean, if you adjust to your algorithm with a mixed speech file and to, eh	no
8282	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no

8309	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Um	no
8310	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	If you	no
8311	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	have somebody who has some experience with this sort of thing, and they work on it for a couple months,	no

8323	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
8324	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	That - that means you set some  thresholds  somewhere or something, right?	no
8325	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no

8331	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Uh, if it's gonna be different from old data that you have?	no

8338	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Actually -	no
8339	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	You have  candidates.	no
8340	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Can-  and just generate candidate and just   try  to get a  first   pass  at something that  sort  of  works.	no
8341	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	actually - actually -	no
8342	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	the candidate.	no
8343	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I -	no
8344	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	to make  marking  easier.	no
8345	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Or -	no
8346	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
8347	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and I  haven't  spent a lot of  time  on it and I'm not  intending  to spend a lot of time on it.	no
8348	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	O_K.	no
8349	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I -	no
8350	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So.	no
8351	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	um, I, unfortunately, have to run, but, um	no
8352	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I can imagine  uh building  a  um	no
8353	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	model of speaker change  detection  that	no
8354	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	takes into account  both the  far-field  and the	no
8355	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yep.	no
8356	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	uh  actually,  not  just the  close-talking  mike for that  speaker,  but actually for  all  of th-	no
8357	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Everyone else.	no
8358	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	for  all  of the speakers.	no
8359	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
8360	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	um	no
8361	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	If you  model  the -	no
8362	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	the  effect that	no
8363	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	me  speaking has on	no
8364	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	your  microphone and everybody else's microphone, as  well  as on that,	no
8365	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and you build, um -	no
8366	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	basically I think you'd - you would	no
8367	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	build a -	no
8368	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	an H_M_M that has	no
8369	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	as a  state  space all of the  possible   speaker  combinations	no
8370	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	All the - Yep.	no
8371	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
8372	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and, um	no
8373	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	you can control -	no
8374	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	It's a little big.	no
8375	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	It's not that big actually, um	no
8376	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Two to the  N_ .	no
8377	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Two to the number of people in the meeting.	no
8378	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	But -	no
8379	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Anyway.	no
8380	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Actually, Andreas may- maybe - maybe just something  simpler  but - but	no
8381	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
8382	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	along the lines of what you're saying, I was just realizing, I used to know this guy who used to build, uh	no
8383	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mmm.	no
8384	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	um,  mike  mixers - automatic  mike  mixers where, you know, t- in order to able to turn up the gain,	no
8385	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah	no
8386	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mmm.	no
8387	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
8388	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	you know, uh	no
8389	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
8390	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	as much as you  can,  you -	no
8391	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	you - you  lower  the gain on - on the mikes of people who aren't  talking,  right?	no
8392	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
8393	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And then he had some sort of	no
8394	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	reasonable way of  doing  that, but	no
8395	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	uh, what if you were just looking at very  simple  measures  like  energy measures but you  don't  just compare it to some  threshold    overall  but you compare it to the  energy  in  the other  microphones.	no
8396	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I was  thinking  about doing that  originally  to find out	no
8397	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	who's  the  loudest,	no
8398	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and  that  person is  certainly   talking.	no
8399	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
8400	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	But I  also  wanted to find  threshold  - uh, excuse me, mol-  overlap.	no
8401	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
8402	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So, not just - just the loudest.	no
8403	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
8404	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	But, eh	no
8405	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I - I	no
8406	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Sorry. I - I have found that when - when I	no
8407	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Sorry, I have to go.	no
8408	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	O_K.	no
8409	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I analyzed the - the speech files from the,  eh  mike, eh  from the eh close eh  microphone, eh  I found zones	no
8410	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Could you fill that out anyway?	no
8411	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Just,  put your name in.	no
8412	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Are y- you want me to do it? I'll do it.	no
8413	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	But  he's  not gonna even  read  that.	no
8414	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I know.	no
8415	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Oh.	no
8416	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	with a - a different level of energy.	no
8417	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	including overlap zone.	no
8418	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	including.	no
8419	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	because, eh  eh  depend on the position of the - of the microph- of the each speaker  to, eh, to get	no
8420	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	more o- or less energy	no
8421	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	i- in the mixed sign- in the signal.	no
8422	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	and then,  if you consider energy to - to detect overlapping	no
8423	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	in - in, uh, and you process the - the - in - the - the - the speech file from the - the - the mixed signals.  The mixed signals, eh.	no
8424	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I - I think it's - it's difficult, um   only to  en-  with energy to - to consider that in that zone	no
8425	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	We have eh, eh, overlapping zone	no
8426	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Eh, if you process only the the energy of the, of each frame.	no
8427	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Well, it's probably harder, but I - I think what I was s-	no
8428	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	nnn	no
8429	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	noting	no
8430	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	just when he - when Andreas  raised  that, was that there's  other  information to be gained from looking at all	no
8431	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	of the microphones and you may not need to look at very  sophisticated  things,	no
8432	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
8433	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
8434	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	because if there's -	no
8435	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	if  most  of the overlaps -	no
8436	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	you know, this doesn't cover, say,  three,  but if  most  of the overlaps, say, are  two,	no
8437	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
8438	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	if the distribution looks like there's a  couple   high  ones and - and  the rest of them are  low,  you know, what I mean,  there's some information there about their distribution even with very simple measures.	no
8439	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
8440	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And everyone else is low, yeah.	no
8441	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
8442	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
8443	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
8444	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
8445	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Uh, by the way, I had an idea with - while I was watching Chuck nodding at a lot of these things, is that we can all wear little bells on our heads,	yes
8446	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	if the distribution looks like there's a  couple   high  ones and - and  the rest of them are  low,  you know, what I mean,  there's some information there about their distribution even with very simple measures.	no
8447	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
8448	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Uh, by the way, I had an idea with - while I was watching Chuck nodding at a lot of these things, is that we can all wear little bells on our heads,	no
8449	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	so that	no
8450	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
8451	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Ding, ding, ding, ding.	no
8452	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	"""Ding"".  That's cute!"	no
8453	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	then you'd know that -	no
8454	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
8455	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I think that'd be really interesting  too,  with blindfolds.	no
8456	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	"Nodding with blindfolds, ""what are you  nodding  about?"""	no
8457	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Then -	no
8458	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.  The question is,  like  whether -	no
8459	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Well, trying with and -	no
8460	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	"""Sorry, I'm just - I'm just going to sleep."""	no
8461	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	with and without, yeah.	no
8462	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	But then there's just  one   @@ , like.	no
8463	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
8464	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Actually,  I  saw a uh - a woman at the  bus  stop the other day who, um, was talking on her  cell  phone	no
8465	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	speaking Japanese, and was  bowing.	no
8466	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah	no
8467	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Oh, yeah, that's really common.	no
8468	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	you know,  profusely.	no
8469	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no

8473	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
8474	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Wow.	no
8475	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	It's very difficult if you try - while you're trying, say, to convince somebody on the phone it's difficult not to move your hands.	no
8476	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Not -	no
8477	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm?	no
8478	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	You know, if you watch people they'll actually  do  these things. So.	no
8479	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I still think we should try a - a meeting or two with the blindfolds, at  least  of this meeting that we have lots of recordings of	no
8480	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Mm-hmm.	no
8481	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Um, maybe for  part  of the meeting, we don't have to do it the  whole  meeting.	no
8482	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah, I think th-	no
8483	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I think it's a  great  idea.	no
8484	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	That could be fun.	no
8485	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	It'll be too hard to make barriers, I was thinking because they have to go all the way	no
8486	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	W-	no
8487	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
8488	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	you know, I can see  Chuck  even if you put a barrier  here.	no
8489	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Well, we could  just  turn out the  lights.	no
8490	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Actually  well also -	no
8491	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I - I can say I  made  barr- barriers for -	no

8500	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	But then we  also  have  these  mikes, is the other thing I was thinking, so we need a barrier that doesn't disturb	no

8620	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	O_K.	no
8621	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	But you don't want to just totally excise it because	no
8622	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	um	no
8623	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	uh, well you have to be  careful  about excising it, how - how you excise it keeping the timing right and so forth so that at the  moment	no
8624	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	tho- th- the idea we're running with is - is h- putting the beep over it.	no
8625	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah, you can either  beep  or it can be  silence.  I - I couldn't  decide.	no
8626	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	O_K.	no
8627	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Ah, yeah.	no
8628	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	which was the  right  way to do it.  Beep  is good  auditorily,	no

8630	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
8631	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
8632	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	but for  software  it's probably better for it to be  silence.	no
8633	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	No,  no. You can - you know, you could make a m-	no
8634	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Hmm.	no
8635	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	as long as you keep using the same  beep,	no
8636	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	people  could make a  model  of that  beep,  and -	no
8637	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yep.	no
8638	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I  like  that idea.	no
8639	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	And I use - it's - it's, uh	no
8640	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I think the beep is a really good idea.	no
8641	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	it's an A_ below middle C_ beep, so	no
8642	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	It's  very   clear.  Then you don't think it's a long pause.	no
8643	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
8644	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Also -	no
8645	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah, it's  more   obvious  that there  was  something  there  than if there's just silence.	no
8646	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah, that - I mean, he's - he's  removing  the old   thing  and - and - and -	no

8664	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Of course.	no
8665	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Interesting.  I  like  that.	no
8666	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah, I like that. Very clear.	no
8667	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
8668	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah you have to do it on all channels because it's, uh   audible.	no
8669	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Uh, it's - it's  potentially  audible, you could potentially recover it.	no
8670	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Very clear.	no
8671	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Ke- keep a back door.	no
8672	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Well, the other thing that - you know, I mean the - the alternative might be to s-	no
8673	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
8674	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Well, I - I  haven't  thrown away any of the meetings that I beeped. Actually yours is the only one that I beeped and then, uh	no
8675	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	the ar- DARPA meeting.	no
8676	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Notice how  quiet  I am.	no
8677	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Sorry, and then the  DARPA  meeting I just excised  completely,  so it's in a private directory.	no
8678	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
8679	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	You have   some  people who  only  have beeps as their speech in these meetings.	no

8683	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	They're easy to find, then.	no
8684	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Alright, so, uh  I think we should, uh  uh, go on to the digits?	no
8685	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	O_K.	no
8686	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I have one concept a- t- I - I want to say,	no
8687	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	which is that I think it's nice that you're preserving the  time  relations,	no
8688	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	s- so you're - you're not just cutting - you're not doing  scissor  snips. You're - you're keeping the, uh	no

8690	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	the time duration of a -  de - deleted - deleted part.	no
8691	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah, definitely.	no
8692	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
8693	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	O_K, good, digits.	no
8694	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah, since we wanna  possibly synchronize these things as well.	no
8695	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Oh, I should have  done  that. Shoot.  Oh well.	no
8696	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	It's great.	no
8697	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
8698	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Oh-	no
8699	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	So I guess if there's an overlap,	no
8700	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	like, if I'm saying something that's  bleepable and somebody else overlaps during it they also get bleeped, too?	no
8701	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	You'll lose it. There's no way around that.	no
8702	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	yes
8703	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	You'll lose it. There's no way around that.	no
8704	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah.	no
8705	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Um	no
8706	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I d- I did -	no
8707	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	before we do the digits, I did also wanna remind people, uh	no
8708	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	please do send me, you know,	no
8709	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	uh	no

8722	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Thank  you.  Thank  you.	no

8731	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	No.	no
8732	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I  have  the  script  now, so, I mean, it can work off the, uh	no

8738	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	As soon as we get labels, yep.	no
8739	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	But it has to be  hand-labeled   first?	no
8740	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	but -	no
8741	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Uh, well,  yeah.  Because, uh  well, I mean	no
8742	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	once  his  - his algorithm is up and running	no
8743	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	If it  works  well enough.	no
8744	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	then we can do it  that  way.	no
8745	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Right now it's  not.	no

8752	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Not  quite  to the point where it works.	no
8753	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	I think - what I - what this has, uh, caused me - so this  discussion	no
8754	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	caused me to wanna  subdivide  these further. I'm gonna take a look at the, uh  backchannels, how much we have	no
8755	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	anal- I hope to have that for next time.	no
8756	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Yeah, my - my algorithm worked  great  actually on  these,	no
8757	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	That'd be interesting.	no

8763	transcript	transcript_Bmr007	Oh.	no

9300	transcript	transcript_Bed004	my idea on that was	no
9301	transcript	transcript_Bed004	uh, partly we'll talk about system stuff for the  computer  scientists, but partly I did want it to get the  linguists  involved	no
9302	transcript	transcript_Bed004	in some of this issue about what the  task  is and	no
9303	transcript	transcript_Bed004	all - um you know, what the  dialogue  is, and what's going on  linguistically,	no
9304	transcript	transcript_Bed004	because to the extent that we can get  them   contributing,	no
9305	transcript	transcript_Bed004	that will be good.	no
9306	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yep.	no
9307	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So this issue about	no
9308	transcript	transcript_Bed004	you know re-formulating things, maybe we can get some of the linguists sufficiently interested that they'll  help  us with it,	no
9309	transcript	transcript_Bed004	uh,  other  linguists, if you're a linguist, but in any case, um,	no
9310	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yep.	no

9319	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Is - is this  make sense to everybody? Yeah.	no

9332	transcript	transcript_Bed004	and we also have a l- little bit on the interface, M_-three-L_ enhancement, and then um that was  it,  I think.	no
9333	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So, what I did for this - this is - uh, a pedagogical belief-net because	yes
9334	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So, what I did for this - this is - uh, a pedagogical belief-net because	no
9335	transcript	transcript_Bed004	I was - I - I took - I tried to	no
9336	transcript	transcript_Bed004	conceptually do what you were talking about with the nodes that you could expand out - so what I did was I took - I made these dummy nodes called Trajector-In and Trajector-Out that	no
9337	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yep.	no
9338	transcript	transcript_Bed004	would isolate the things related to the trajector. And then there were the things with the source and the path and the goal.	no
9339	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yep.	no
9340	transcript	transcript_Bed004	And I separated them out. And then I um did similar things for our - our net to - uh with the context and the discourse and whatnot,	no
9341	transcript	transcript_Bed004	um, so we could sort of isolate them or whatever in terms of the - the  top  layer.	no
9342	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Mm-hmm.	no
9343	transcript	transcript_Bed004	And then the bottom layer is just the Mode.	no
9344	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So, let's - let's - Yeah, I don't understand it. Let's go -	no
9345	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So.	no
9346	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Slide all the way up so we see what the p- the p-	no
9347	transcript	transcript_Bed004	very  bottom  looks like, or is  that  it?	no
9348	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"Yeah, there's just one more node and it says ""Mode"" which is the decision between the -"	no
9349	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah.	no
9350	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K, great. Alright. So -	no
9351	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So basically all I did was I took the last  belief-net	no
9352	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Mm-hmm.	no
9353	transcript	transcript_Bed004	and I grouped things according to what - how I thought they would fit in to	no
9354	transcript	transcript_Bed004	uh  image  schemas that would be related. And the two that I came up with	no
9355	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yep.	no
9356	transcript	transcript_Bed004	were Trajector-landmark and then Source-path-goal as initial ones.	no
9357	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Mm-hmm.	no
9358	transcript	transcript_Bed004	And then I said well, uh the trajector would be the person in this case probably.	no
9359	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Right, yep.	no
9360	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Um,	no
9361	transcript	transcript_Bed004	you know, we have - we have the concept of what their intention was, whether they were trying to tour or do business or whatever,	no
9362	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Right.	no
9363	transcript	transcript_Bed004	or they were hurried.  That's  kind of related to  that.  And then um	no
9364	transcript	transcript_Bed004	in terms of the source, the things - uh the only things that we had on there I believe were whether -	no
9365	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Oh actually, I kind of, - I might have added these cuz I don't think we talked too much about the source in the old one but	no
9366	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Mm-hmm.	no
9367	transcript	transcript_Bed004	uh whether the - where I'm  currently  at is a landmark might have a bearing on whether -	no
9368	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"or the ""landmark-iness"" of where I'm  currently  at. And ""usefulness"" is basi- basically means is that an institutional facility like a town hall or something like that that's not -"	no
9369	transcript	transcript_Bed004	something that you'd visit for tourist's - tourism's sake or whatever.	no
9370	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"""Travel constraints"" would be something like"	no
9371	transcript	transcript_Bed004	you know, maybe they said they can - they only wanna take a  bus  or something like that, right?	no
9372	transcript	transcript_Bed004	And then those are somewhat related to the path, so that would	no
9373	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Mm-hmm.	no
9374	transcript	transcript_Bed004	determine whether we'd - could take - we would be telling them to go to the bus stop or versus walking there directly.	no
9375	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"Um, ""Goal""."	no
9376	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Similar things as the  source  except they also added whether the entity was closed and whether they have somehow marked that is was the final destination.	no
9377	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Um,	no
9378	transcript	transcript_Bed004	and then if you go up,	no
9379	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Robert,	no
9380	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah, so -	no
9381	transcript	transcript_Bed004	um,	no
9382	transcript	transcript_Bed004	in terms of Context, what we had currently said was	no
9383	transcript	transcript_Bed004	whether they were a businessman or a tourist of some other	no
9384	transcript	transcript_Bed004	person.	no
9385	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Um, Discourse was related to whether they had asked about open hours or whether they asked about where the entrance was or the admission fee, or something along those lines.	no
9386	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Mm-hmm.	no
9387	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Uh, Prosody I don't really - I'm not really sure what prosody means, in this context,	no
9388	transcript	transcript_Bed004	so I just made up you know whether - whether what they say is - or h-  how  they say it	no
9389	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Right, O_K.	no
9390	transcript	transcript_Bed004	is - is  that.	no
9391	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Um, the Parse would be what verb they chose, and then maybe how they modified it, in the sense of	no
9392	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"whether they said ""I need to get there quickly"" or whatever."	no
9393	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Mm-hmm.	no
9394	transcript	transcript_Bed004	And um, in terms of World Knowledge, this would just basically be like opening and closing times of things, the time of day it is, and whatnot.	no
9395	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"What's ""tourbook""?"	no
9396	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"Tourbook? That would be, I don't know, the ""landmark-iness"" of things,"	no
9397	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Mm-hmm.	no
9398	transcript	transcript_Bed004	whether it's in the  tourbook  or not.	no
9399	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Ch-ch-ch-ch.	no
9400	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Now.    Alright, so I understand what's -	no
9401	transcript	transcript_Bed004	what you  got.	no
9402	transcript	transcript_Bed004	I don't yet understand  how you would  use  it. So let me see if I can ask	no
9403	transcript	transcript_Bed004	a s-	no
9404	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Well, this is not a working Bayes-net.	no
9405	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Right.	no
9406	transcript	transcript_Bed004	No, I  understand  that, but - but um	no
9407	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So,	no
9408	transcript	transcript_Bed004	what -	no
9409	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Let's slide back up again and see - start at the - at the  bottom  and	no
9410	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Oop-bo-doop-boop-boop.  Yeah.	no
9411	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So,	no
9412	transcript	transcript_Bed004	you could  imagine	no
9413	transcript	transcript_Bed004	w-	no
9414	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Uh,	no
9415	transcript	transcript_Bed004	go ahead, you were about to go up there and  point  to something.	no
9416	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Well I - O_K, I just - Say what you were gonna say. O_K.	no
9417	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Good, do it! No no, go do it.	no
9418	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Uh - I - I'd -	no
9419	transcript	transcript_Bed004	No, I was gonna wait until -	no
9420	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Oh,  O_K . So, so if you - if we made - if we wanted to make it into a - a real uh Bayes-net,	no
9421	transcript	transcript_Bed004	that is, you know, with fill - you know, actually f- uh, fill it  @@  in, then uh -	no
9422	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So we'd have to get rid of  this	no
9423	transcript	transcript_Bed004	and connect these things directly to the Mode.	no
9424	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Well, I don't - That's an issue. So, um -	no
9425	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Cuz I don't understand how it would work otherwise.	no
9426	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Well, here's the problem.	no
9427	transcript	transcript_Bed004	And - and uh - Bhaskara and I was talking about this a little earlier today - is, if we just  do  this, we could wind up with a  huge	no
9428	transcript	transcript_Bed004	uh,	no
9429	transcript	transcript_Bed004	combinatoric input to the  Mode  thing.	no
9430	transcript	transcript_Bed004	And uh -	no
9431	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Well I - oh yeah, I unders- I understand  that,  I just - uh it's hard for me to imagine how he could get around that.	no
9432	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Well, i- But  that's  what we have to  do.	no
9433	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K.	no
9434	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K, so, so,	no
9435	transcript	transcript_Bed004	uh.	no
9436	transcript	transcript_Bed004	There - there are a variety of ways of doing it.	no
9437	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Uh. Let me just mention something that I  don't  want to pursue today which is	no
9438	transcript	transcript_Bed004	there are  technical  ways of doing it, uh I- I slipped a paper to Bhaskara	no
9439	transcript	transcript_Bed004	and - about Noisy-OR's and Noisy-MAXes and	no
9440	transcript	transcript_Bed004	there're ways to	no
9441	transcript	transcript_Bed004	uh sort of back off on the purity of your Bayes-net-edness.	no
9442	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Mmm.	no
9443	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Uh,	no
9444	transcript	transcript_Bed004	so. If you co- you could ima- and I- now I don't	no
9445	transcript	transcript_Bed004	know  that any of those actually  apply  in this case, but there is some technology you could try to apply.	no
9446	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So it's possible that we could do something like a summary node of some sort that -	no
9447	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah.	no
9448	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K.	no
9449	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah.	no
9450	transcript	transcript_Bed004	And, um	no
9451	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So.	no
9452	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So in  that  case, the sum- we'd have - we - I mean, these wouldn't be the  summary  nodes. We'd have the summary nodes like where the things were - I guess maybe if thi- if things were related to business or	no
9453	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah.	no
9454	transcript	transcript_Bed004	some other -	no
9455	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So what I was gonna  say  is - is maybe a good at this point	no
9456	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah.	no
9457	transcript	transcript_Bed004	is to	no
9458	transcript	transcript_Bed004	try to  informally  - I mean, not necessarily in th- in this  meeting,	no
9459	transcript	transcript_Bed004	but to try to  informally  think about what the decision variables  are.	no
9460	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So, if you have some bottom line	no
9461	transcript	transcript_Bed004	uh decision about which  mode,	no
9462	transcript	transcript_Bed004	you know,  what  are the most relevant  things.	no
9463	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Mmm.	no
9464	transcript	transcript_Bed004	And the  other  trick, which is not a  technical  trick, it's kind of a  knowledge  engineering trick,	no
9465	transcript	transcript_Bed004	is to make the n-  each node sufficiently narrow	no
9466	transcript	transcript_Bed004	that you don't get this combinatorics. So	no
9467	transcript	transcript_Bed004	that if you decided	no
9468	transcript	transcript_Bed004	that you could characterize the decision as a trade-off between three factors, whatever they may be,	no
9469	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"O_K? then you could say ""Aha, let's have  these   three  factors"","	no
9470	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K? and maybe a binary version f- for each, or	no
9471	transcript	transcript_Bed004	some relatively compact	no
9472	transcript	transcript_Bed004	decision node just  above  the final one.	no
9473	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Mmm.	no
9474	transcript	transcript_Bed004	And  then  the question would be if - if  those  are the things that you  care  about,	no
9475	transcript	transcript_Bed004	uh can you make a  relatively  compact way of getting	no
9476	transcript	transcript_Bed004	from the various  inputs  to the things you  care  about.	no
9477	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So that y-	no
9478	transcript	transcript_Bed004	so that, you know, you can sort of try to do a  knowledge  engineering thing	no
9479	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K.	no
9480	transcript	transcript_Bed004	given  that we're not gonna screw with the	no
9481	transcript	transcript_Bed004	technology  and just always use	no
9482	transcript	transcript_Bed004	uh sort of orthodox  Bayes-nets,  then we have a knowledge engineering little problem of	no
9483	transcript	transcript_Bed004	how do we  do  that.	no
9484	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Um	no
9485	transcript	transcript_Bed004	and	no
9486	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So what I kind of need to do is to take  this  one and the  old  one and merge them together? So that -	no
9487	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"""Eh-eh-eh."""	no
9488	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah.	no
9489	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Well,	no
9490	transcript	transcript_Bed004	mmm,	no
9491	transcript	transcript_Bed004	something.  I mean, so	no
9492	transcript	transcript_Bed004	uh,  Robert  has thought about this problem f- for a long time, cuz he's had these examples	no
9493	transcript	transcript_Bed004	kicking around, so he may have some good intuition	no
9494	transcript	transcript_Bed004	about	no
9495	transcript	transcript_Bed004	you know, what  are  the crucial things.	no
9496	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Mmm.	no
9497	transcript	transcript_Bed004	and,	no
9498	transcript	transcript_Bed004	um,	no
9499	transcript	transcript_Bed004	I understand where this - the uh -	no
9500	transcript	transcript_Bed004	this is a way of	no
9501	transcript	transcript_Bed004	playing with this abs- Source-path-goal trajector exp- uh uh abstraction and - and sort of sh- displaying it in a particular way.	no
9502	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah.	no
9503	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Uh,	no
9504	transcript	transcript_Bed004	I don't think our friends	no
9505	transcript	transcript_Bed004	uh on Wednesday are going to be able to -	no
9506	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Well,  maybe  they will. Well, let me think about whether - whether I think we can present this to them or  not.	no
9507	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Um,	no
9508	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Uh,	no
9509	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Well, I think this is still, I mean,	no
9510	transcript	transcript_Bed004	ad-hoc. This is sort of th- the second	no
9511	transcript	transcript_Bed004	version and I - I - I - look at this maybe just as a,	no
9512	transcript	transcript_Bed004	you know, a - a - whatever, U_M_L diagram or, you know, as just a uh screen shot,	no
9513	transcript	transcript_Bed004	not really as a Bayes-net as John - Johno said.	no
9514	transcript	transcript_Bed004	We could actually, y- yeah draw it in a different way,	no
9515	transcript	transcript_Bed004	in the sense that it would make it more abstract.	no
9516	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah.	no
9517	transcript	transcript_Bed004	But the uh -	no
9518	transcript	transcript_Bed004	the - the nice thing is that you know, it just	no
9519	transcript	transcript_Bed004	is a - is a visual aid for thinking about these things which has comple-	no
9520	transcript	transcript_Bed004	clearly have to be specified m- more carefully and uh	no
9521	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Alright, well, le- let me think about this some more,	no
9522	transcript	transcript_Bed004	and uh see if we can	no
9523	transcript	transcript_Bed004	find a way to	no
9524	transcript	transcript_Bed004	present this	no
9525	transcript	transcript_Bed004	to this  linguists  group that - that is  helpful  to  them.	no
9526	transcript	transcript_Bed004	I mean,	no
9527	transcript	transcript_Bed004	ultimately we - we may w- w-	no
9528	transcript	transcript_Bed004	we regard this as sort of an exercise in -	no
9529	transcript	transcript_Bed004	in thinking about the problem	no
9530	transcript	transcript_Bed004	and maybe a first version of uh	no
9531	transcript	transcript_Bed004	a  module,  if you wanna call it that, that you can ask,	no
9532	transcript	transcript_Bed004	that you can give input and it- it'll uh throw the dice for you,	no
9533	transcript	transcript_Bed004	uh throw the die for you,  because um	no
9534	transcript	transcript_Bed004	I integrated this into the  existing  SmartKom system in - in the same way as	no
9535	transcript	transcript_Bed004	much the same way we can um	no
9536	transcript	transcript_Bed004	sort of have this uh -	no
9537	transcript	transcript_Bed004	this  thing.	no
9538	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Close this down.	no
9539	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So if this is what M_-three-L_ um	no
9540	transcript	transcript_Bed004	will  look  like and what it'll  give  us,	no
9541	transcript	transcript_Bed004	um - And a very simple thing. We have an action that he wants to go from somewhere, which is some type of object, to someplace.	no
9542	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Mm-hmm.	no
9543	transcript	transcript_Bed004	And this - these uh - this changed now  only  um,	no
9544	transcript	transcript_Bed004	um -	no
9545	transcript	transcript_Bed004	It's doing it twice now because it already did it once.	no
9546	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"Um, we'll add some action type, which in this case is ""Approach"""	no
9547	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Mm-hmm.	no
9548	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Good.	no
9549	transcript	transcript_Bed004	and could be, you know, more refined uh	no
9550	transcript	transcript_Bed004	in many ways. Or we can uh	no
9551	transcript	transcript_Bed004	have something where the uh	no
9552	transcript	transcript_Bed004	goal is a public place	no
9553	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"and it will give us then of course an action type of the type ""Enter""."	no
9554	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So this is just based on this one -	no
9555	transcript	transcript_Bed004	um,	no
9556	transcript	transcript_Bed004	on this one feature,	no
9557	transcript	transcript_Bed004	and that's - that's about all you can do.	no
9558	transcript	transcript_Bed004	And so in the f- if this pla- if the object type	no
9559	transcript	transcript_Bed004	um here is - is a m- is a landmark,	no
9560	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"of course it'll be um ""Vista""."	no
9561	transcript	transcript_Bed004	And um	no
9562	transcript	transcript_Bed004	this is about as much as we can  do	no
9563	transcript	transcript_Bed004	if we don't w- if we want to avoid uh uh a huge combinatorial explosion where we specify	no
9564	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"""O_K, if it's  this  and  this  but  that  is not the case"", and so forth, it just gets really really messy."	no
9565	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K, I'm sorry. You're - you're -	no
9566	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Hmm?	no
9567	transcript	transcript_Bed004	It was  much  too quick for me.	no
9568	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K, so let me see if I understand what you're saying.	no
9569	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So, I - I  do  understand that	no
9570	transcript	transcript_Bed004	uh you can take the M_-three-L_ and	no
9571	transcript	transcript_Bed004	add not - and it w-	no
9572	transcript	transcript_Bed004	and you  need  to do this, for sure, we have to add, you know, not too much about	no
9573	transcript	transcript_Bed004	um	no
9574	transcript	transcript_Bed004	object types and stuff,	no
9575	transcript	transcript_Bed004	and what I  think  you did	no
9576	transcript	transcript_Bed004	is add some rules  of the style that are already  there  that say	no
9577	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"""If it's of type ""Landmark"", then you"	no
9578	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"take - you're gonna take a picture of it."""	no
9579	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Exactly.	no
9580	transcript	transcript_Bed004	F- full stop, I mean, that's what you do.	no
9581	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Ev- every landmark you take a picture of,	no
9582	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Every public place you enter, and statue you want to go as near as possible.	no
9583	transcript	transcript_Bed004	you enter -	no
9584	transcript	transcript_Bed004	You approach.	no
9585	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K.	no
9586	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Uh,	no
9587	transcript	transcript_Bed004	and certainly you can add rules like that to	no
9588	transcript	transcript_Bed004	the existing SmartKom system.	no
9589	transcript	transcript_Bed004	And you just did, right? O_K.	no
9590	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah.	no
9591	transcript	transcript_Bed004	And it - it would do us no good. That - Ultimately.	no
9592	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Ah.	no
9593	transcript	transcript_Bed004	W-	no
9594	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Well.  So, s- well, and let's think about this.	no
9595	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Um,	no
9596	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"that's a - that's another kind of baseline case, that's another sort of thing ""O_K,"	no
9597	transcript	transcript_Bed004	here's a - another kind of minimal	no
9598	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"uh way of tackling this""."	no
9599	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"Add extra properties, a deterministic rule for every property you have an action, ""pppt!"""	no
9600	transcript	transcript_Bed004	You  do  that.	no
9601	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Um,  then  the question would be	no
9602	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Uh	no
9603	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Now, if that's  all  you're doing,	no
9604	transcript	transcript_Bed004	then you can get the types from the  ontology,	no
9605	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K? because	no
9606	transcript	transcript_Bed004	that's all - you're - all you're  using  is this type - the types in the ontology and you're  done.	no
9607	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Hmm?	no
9608	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Right? So we don't - we don't use the  discourse,  we don't use the  context,  we don't do  any  of those things.	no
9609	transcript	transcript_Bed004	No.	no
9610	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Alright, but that's -	no
9611	transcript	transcript_Bed004	but that's O_K, and I mean it- it's again a kind of	no
9612	transcript	transcript_Bed004	one minimal extension	no
9613	transcript	transcript_Bed004	of the existing things.	no
9614	transcript	transcript_Bed004	And that's something the uh	no
9615	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"SmartKom people  themselves  would - they'd say ""Sure, that's no problem - you know, no problem to add types to the ont-"" Right?"	no
9616	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah.	no
9617	transcript	transcript_Bed004	No. And this is - just in order to exemplify what - what we can do very, very easily is, um we have	no
9618	transcript	transcript_Bed004	this - this silly	no
9619	transcript	transcript_Bed004	uh interface and we have	no
9620	transcript	transcript_Bed004	the rules that are as banal as  of  we just saw, and we have our content. Now, the content -	no
9621	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Hmm.	no
9622	transcript	transcript_Bed004	I - whi- which is sort of what - what we see  here,  which is sort of the Vista, Schema, Source, Path, Goal, whatever. This will	no
9623	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah.	no
9624	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah.	no
9625	transcript	transcript_Bed004	um be um a job to find ways of writing down	no
9626	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Image schema, X_schema, constructions, in some - some form,	no
9627	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"and have this be in a - in a - in the content, loosely called ""Constructicon""."	no
9628	transcript	transcript_Bed004	And the  rules  we want to throw away  completely.	no
9629	transcript	transcript_Bed004	And um - and here is exactly where what's gonna be replaced with our Bayes-net, which is exactly getting the input feeding into here.  This  decides	no
9630	transcript	transcript_Bed004	whether it's an- whether action - the - the Enter, the Vista,	no
9631	transcript	transcript_Bed004	or the whatever	no
9632	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"Uh, "" approach "", you called it, I think  this  time."	no
9633	transcript	transcript_Bed004	uh	no
9634	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Approach um construction should be activated,	no
9635	transcript	transcript_Bed004	That's what you  said  - Yeah, that's fine.	no
9636	transcript	transcript_Bed004	I_E just pasted in.	no
9637	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah, but -	no
9638	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Right. But it's  not   construction  there, it's  action.	no
9639	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Construction  is a d- is a different story.	no
9640	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah.	no
9641	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Right. This is uh - so what we'd be generating would be	no
9642	transcript	transcript_Bed004	a reference to a semantic	no
9643	transcript	transcript_Bed004	uh like parameters for the -	no
9644	transcript	transcript_Bed004	For - for - for -	no
9645	transcript	transcript_Bed004	for the X_schema?	no
9646	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yes.	no
9647	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K.	no
9648	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah.	no
9649	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So that - that uh i- if you had the	no
9650	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"generalized ""Go"" X_schema and you wanted to specialize it to these three ones, then you would have to supply the parameters."	no
9651	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Right.	no
9652	transcript	transcript_Bed004	And  then	no
9653	transcript	transcript_Bed004	uh, although we haven't worried about this yet, you might wanna worry about something that would	no
9654	transcript	transcript_Bed004	go to the G_I_S	no
9655	transcript	transcript_Bed004	and use that to actually get	no
9656	transcript	transcript_Bed004	you know, detailed route planning. So, you know, where do you do take a picture of it and stuff like that.	no
9657	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Mm-hmm.	no
9658	transcript	transcript_Bed004	But that's	no
9659	transcript	transcript_Bed004	not - It's not the  immediate  problem.	no
9660	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Right.	no
9661	transcript	transcript_Bed004	But, presumably that - that - that functionality's there when - when we -	no
9662	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So the immediate problem is just deciding w-	no
9663	transcript	transcript_Bed004	which -	no
9664	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Aspects of the X_schema to add.	no
9665	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah, so the pro- The  immediate  problem is - is back t- t- to what you were - what you are doing with the belief-net. You know,	no
9666	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah.	no
9667	transcript	transcript_Bed004	uh what are we going to use to make this decision -	no
9668	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Right and then, once we've made the decision, how do we put that into the content?	no
9669	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah.	no
9670	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Right.	no
9671	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Right. Well,  that  -  that  actually is relatively  easy  in this  case.	no
9672	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K.	no
9673	transcript	transcript_Bed004	The  harder  problem is	no
9674	transcript	transcript_Bed004	we decide what we want to  use,  how are we gonna  get  it?	no
9675	transcript	transcript_Bed004	And  that  the - the -  that's  the hardest problem. So, the  hardest  problem is	no
9676	transcript	transcript_Bed004	how are you going to  get  this information	no
9677	transcript	transcript_Bed004	from some combination of the -	no
9678	transcript	transcript_Bed004	what the person says and the context and the ontology.	no
9679	transcript	transcript_Bed004	The h-	no
9680	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So, I think that's the hardest problem at the moment is - is	no
9681	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K.	no
9682	transcript	transcript_Bed004	where are you gonna - how are you gonna g-  get  this information.	no
9683	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Um, and that's - so, getting back to here, uh, we have a d- a technical problem with the belief-nets that we - we	no
9684	transcript	transcript_Bed004	don't want all the com-	no
9685	transcript	transcript_Bed004	There's just too many factors right now.	no
9686	transcript	transcript_Bed004	too many factors if we - if we allow them to just go combinatorially.	no
9687	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Right.	no
9688	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So we wanna think about which ones we really care about	no
9689	transcript	transcript_Bed004	and what they  really  most depend on, and can we c- you know, clean this - this up to the point where it -	no
9690	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So what we really wanna do i- cuz this is really just the three layer	no
9691	transcript	transcript_Bed004	net, we wanna b-	no
9692	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Right.	no
9693	transcript	transcript_Bed004	make it - expand it out into more layers basically?	no
9694	transcript	transcript_Bed004	We  might.	no
9695	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Uh,	no
9696	transcript	transcript_Bed004	I mean that - that's certainly one thing we can do. Uh, it's true that	no
9697	transcript	transcript_Bed004	the way you have this,	no
9698	transcript	transcript_Bed004	a lot of the times you have -	no
9699	transcript	transcript_Bed004	what you're having is the  values  rather than the  variable.	no
9700	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So uh -	no
9701	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Right.	no
9702	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K? So you -	no
9703	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"So instead of in- instead it should really be - just be ""intention"" as a node instead of ""intention business"" or ""intention tour""."	no
9704	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"Yeah, right, and then it would have values, uh, ""Tour"", ""Business"", or uh ""Hurried""."	no
9705	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Right.	no
9706	transcript	transcript_Bed004	But then - but i- it still some knowledge design to do, about i- how do you wanna break this up, what really matters.	no
9707	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Right.	no
9708	transcript	transcript_Bed004	I mean, it's fine.	no
9709	transcript	transcript_Bed004	You know, we have to - it's - it's iterative. We're gonna have to work with it some.	no
9710	transcript	transcript_Bed004	I think what was going through my mind when I did it was someone could both have	no
9711	transcript	transcript_Bed004	a business intention and a touring intention and	no
9712	transcript	transcript_Bed004	the probabilities of	no
9713	transcript	transcript_Bed004	both of them happening at the same time -	no
9714	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Well, you - you could  do  that. And it's perfectly O_K  to uh insist that - that, you know,  th-	no
9715	transcript	transcript_Bed004	um, they add up to  one,	no
9716	transcript	transcript_Bed004	but that there's uh - that - that it doesn't have to be one zero  zero.	no
9717	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Mmm. O_K.	no
9718	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K. So you could have the conditional p-	no
9719	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So the -	no
9720	transcript	transcript_Bed004	each  of these things is gonna be a - a - a  probability.	no
9721	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So whenever there's a choice,	no
9722	transcript	transcript_Bed004	uh -	no
9723	transcript	transcript_Bed004	so like  landmark-ness  and  usefulness,  O_K -	no
9724	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Well, see I don't think  those  would be mutually -	no
9725	transcript	transcript_Bed004	it seems like something could both be -	no
9726	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Absolutely right.	no
9727	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K.	no
9728	transcript	transcript_Bed004	And so that you might want to then have those b-	no
9729	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Th- Then they may have to be separate. They may not be able to be values of the same	no
9730	transcript	transcript_Bed004	variable.	no
9731	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Object type, mm-hmm.	no
9732	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So that's - but again, this is - this is the sort of knowledge design you have to go through.	no
9733	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah, this is just more	no
9734	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"me taking last - the last one, and saying ""how can I formalize this?""  @@"	no
9735	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Right.	no
9736	transcript	transcript_Bed004	It's - you know, it's great - is - is, you know, as one step toward uh -	no
9737	transcript	transcript_Bed004	toward where we wanna go.	no
9738	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Also it strikes me that we - we m- may want to approach the point where we can sort of try to find a -	no
9739	transcript	transcript_Bed004	uh, a specification for some interface, here that um	no
9740	transcript	transcript_Bed004	takes the normal M_-three-L_, looks at it. Then we discussed in our pre-edu - E_D_U meeting um how to ask the ontology, what to ask the ontology	no
9741	transcript	transcript_Bed004	um the fact that we can pretend we have one, make a dummy until we get the  real  one,	no
9742	transcript	transcript_Bed004	and so um we -	no
9743	transcript	transcript_Bed004	we  may  wanna decide we can do this from here, but we also could do it um	no
9744	transcript	transcript_Bed004	you know if we have a - a - a belief-net interface.	no
9745	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So the belief-net takes as input, a vector, right?	no
9746	transcript	transcript_Bed004	of stuff.	no
9747	transcript	transcript_Bed004	And it -	no
9748	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah.	no
9749	transcript	transcript_Bed004	And um it- Output is whatever,	no
9750	transcript	transcript_Bed004	as well.	no
9751	transcript	transcript_Bed004	But this information is just M_-three-L_,	no
9752	transcript	transcript_Bed004	and then we want to look up some more stuff in the ontology and we want to look up some more stuff	no
9753	transcript	transcript_Bed004	in the - maybe we want to ask the real world, maybe you want to look something up in the G_R_S, but also we definitely want to	no
9754	transcript	transcript_Bed004	look up in the dialogue history um some s- some stuff. Based on we - we have uh - I was just made some examples from the ontology	no
9755	transcript	transcript_Bed004	and so we have for example some information there that the town hall is both a - a - a building and it has doors and stuff like this, but it is also an institution, so it has a mayor and so forth and so forth	no
9756	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"and we get relations out of it and once we  have  them, we can use  that  information to look in the dialogue history, ""were any of  these  things that - that are part of the town hall as an  institution  mentioned?"", ""were any of these that make the town hall a  building  mentioned?"","	no
9757	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Mm-hmm.	no
9758	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Right.	no
9759	transcript	transcript_Bed004	and so forth, and maybe draw some inferences on that. So this may be a - a sort of a process of two to three steps before we get our vector, that we feed into the belief-net, and then -	no
9760	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah. I think that's - I think that's exactly right.	no
9761	transcript	transcript_Bed004	There  will  be  rules,  but they aren't rules that come to final  decisions,  they're rules that gather information for a decision process.	no
9762	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah.	no
9763	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah, no I think that's - that's just fine.	no
9764	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Uh,  yeah.  So they'll - they - presumably there'll be	no
9765	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"a thread or process or something that ""Agent"","	no
9766	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"yeah, ""Agent"", whatever you wan- wanna say, yeah,"	no
9767	transcript	transcript_Bed004	that uh is rule-driven, and can - can uh -	no
9768	transcript	transcript_Bed004	can do things like that. And um there's an issue about whether there will be - that'll be the  same  agent and the one that then goes off and uh carries  out  the decision, so it probably  will.	no
9769	transcript	transcript_Bed004	My guess is it'll be the same basic agent that um	no
9770	transcript	transcript_Bed004	can go off and get information,	no
9771	transcript	transcript_Bed004	run it through a - a c- this belief-net that -	no
9772	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Turn the crank, yeah.	no
9773	transcript	transcript_Bed004	turn a crank in the belief-net, that'll come out with s-	no
9774	transcript	transcript_Bed004	uh more - another vector,	no
9775	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K,	no
9776	transcript	transcript_Bed004	which can then be	no
9777	transcript	transcript_Bed004	uh applied	no
9778	transcript	transcript_Bed004	at what we would call the simulation or action end. So you now know what you're gonna do and	no
9779	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"that may actually involve getting  more  information. So on- once you pull that out, it could be that that says ""Ah! Now that we know that we gonna go ask the ontology something else."""	no
9780	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Mmm.	no
9781	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K? Now that we  know  that it's a  bus  trip,	no
9782	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K? we didn't - We didn't need to know beforehand, uh how long the bus trip takes or whatever, but - but now that	no
9783	transcript	transcript_Bed004	we  know  that's the way it's coming out then we gotta go find out more. So I think that's O_K.	no
9784	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Mm-hmm.	no
9785	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Mm-hmm.	no
9786	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So this is actually, s- if - if we  were  to build something that	no
9787	transcript	transcript_Bed004	is um,	no
9788	transcript	transcript_Bed004	and, uh, I had one more thing,	no
9789	transcript	transcript_Bed004	the -	no
9790	transcript	transcript_Bed004	it needs to do -	no
9791	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah.	no
9792	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"I think we - I - I can come up with a - a code for a module that we call the ""cognitive dispatcher"","	no
9793	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K.	no
9794	transcript	transcript_Bed004	which does nothing, but it looks  of complect  object trees and decides how - are there parts missing that need to be filled out, there's - this is maybe something that this module can do, something that this module can do and then collect	no
9795	transcript	transcript_Bed004	uh sub-objects and then	no
9796	transcript	transcript_Bed004	recombine them and put them together.	no
9797	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So maybe this is actually some - some useful tool that we can use to rewrite it,	no
9798	transcript	transcript_Bed004	and uh	no
9799	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Oh, O_K. Uh.	no
9800	transcript	transcript_Bed004	get this part, then. Yeah.	no
9801	transcript	transcript_Bed004	I confess, I'm still	no
9802	transcript	transcript_Bed004	not completely comfortable with the overall story. Um.	no
9803	transcript	transcript_Bed004	I-	no
9804	transcript	transcript_Bed004	i- This - this is not a complaint, this is a promise to do more work.	no
9805	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So I'm gonna hafta think about it some more. Um.	no
9806	transcript	transcript_Bed004	In particular -	no
9807	transcript	transcript_Bed004	see what we'd  like  to do,	no
9808	transcript	transcript_Bed004	and - and this has been implicit in the discussion,	no
9809	transcript	transcript_Bed004	is to	no
9810	transcript	transcript_Bed004	do  this in such a way that you get a lot of  re-use.	no
9811	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So. What you're trying to get out of this deep co- cognitive linguistics	no
9812	transcript	transcript_Bed004	is the fact that w- if you know about source - source,  paths   and goals, and nnn  all this sort of stuff,	no
9813	transcript	transcript_Bed004	that a  lot  of this is the  same,	no
9814	transcript	transcript_Bed004	for different tasks. And that -	no
9815	transcript	transcript_Bed004	uh there's - there's some - some important generalities that you're  getting,  so that you  don't  take each and every one of these tasks and hafta re- do  it.	no
9816	transcript	transcript_Bed004	And I don't  yet  see how that  goes.	no
9817	transcript	transcript_Bed004	There're no primitives upon which  uh yeah.	no
9818	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Alright.	no
9819	transcript	transcript_Bed004	u- u-	no
9820	transcript	transcript_Bed004	What are the primitives, and how do you break this -	no
9821	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So I y- I'm just -	no
9822	transcript	transcript_Bed004	just there saying eee  well you - I know how to do any  individual  case,	no
9823	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Right.	no
9824	transcript	transcript_Bed004	right? but I  don't  yet - see what's the  really  interesting question is can you use uh deep	no
9825	transcript	transcript_Bed004	uh cognitive  linguistics  to  get powerful generalizations.	no
9826	transcript	transcript_Bed004	And um	no
9827	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yep.	no
9828	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"Maybe we sho- should we a- add then the ""what's this?"""	no
9829	transcript	transcript_Bed004	domain?	no
9830	transcript	transcript_Bed004	N-	no
9831	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"I mean, we have to ""how do I get to X_""."	no
9832	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"Then we also have the ""what's this?"" domain,"	no
9833	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Right.	no
9834	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Could.  Uh.	no
9835	transcript	transcript_Bed004	where we get some slightly different -	no
9836	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"Um  Johno,  actually, does not allow us to call them ""intentions"" anymore. So he - he dislikes the term."	no
9837	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah.	no
9838	transcript	transcript_Bed004	I didn't  @@ .	no
9839	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Well, I -  I  don't like the term  either,  so I have n-  i-  uh	no
9840	transcript	transcript_Bed004	i- i- y- w- i- i-	no
9841	transcript	transcript_Bed004	It uh -	no
9842	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"But um, I'm sure the ""what's this?"" questions also create some interesting X_schema aspects."	no
9843	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Could be. I'm not a - I'm not op- particularly opposed to adding that or any other task, I mean, eventually we're gonna want a whole range of them.	no
9844	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So.	no
9845	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Mm-hmm.	no
9846	transcript	transcript_Bed004	That's right.	no
9847	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Uh,	no
9848	transcript	transcript_Bed004	I'm just saying that	no
9849	transcript	transcript_Bed004	I'm gonna hafta do some sort of first principles thinking about this. I just at the moment don't know. H-	no
9850	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Mm-hmm.	no
9851	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"Do you mean in the sense of ""is there a way we can generalize the Bayes-net"", or -"	no
9852	transcript	transcript_Bed004	No. Well, no the Bayes - the Bayes-nets -	no
9853	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Seems like it has to be specific.	no
9854	transcript	transcript_Bed004	The Bayes-nets will be dec- specific for each decision. But what I'd like to be able to do	no
9855	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K.	no
9856	transcript	transcript_Bed004	is to have the way that you extract properties,	no
9857	transcript	transcript_Bed004	that will go into different Bayes-nets, be	no
9858	transcript	transcript_Bed004	the - uh  general.	no
9859	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Mm-hmm.	no
9860	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So that if you have sources, you have trajectors and stuff like that, and there's a language for  talking  about trajectors,	no
9861	transcript	transcript_Bed004	you  shouldn't  have to do that  differently	no
9862	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Right. O_K.	no
9863	transcript	transcript_Bed004	for uh uh going to something, than for circling it, for uh telling someone else how to go there,  whatever  it is.	no
9864	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Getting out of -	no
9865	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So that - that, the -	no
9866	transcript	transcript_Bed004	the  decision  processes are gonna be different	no
9867	transcript	transcript_Bed004	What you'd  really  like of course is the same thing you'd  always  like which is that you have	no
9868	transcript	transcript_Bed004	um a kind of intermediate representation which looks the same o- over a bunch of inputs and a bunch of outputs.	no
9869	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So all sorts of different tasks	no
9870	transcript	transcript_Bed004	and all sorts of different ways of  expressing  them use a lot of the same mechanism for pulling out what are the fundamental things going  on.	no
9871	transcript	transcript_Bed004	And	no
9872	transcript	transcript_Bed004	that's - that would be the really  pretty  result.	no
9873	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Right.	no
9874	transcript	transcript_Bed004	And	no
9875	transcript	transcript_Bed004	pushing it one step further, when you get to construction grammar and stuff, what you'd like to be able to do is say you have this  parser  which is much fancier than the parser that comes with	no
9876	transcript	transcript_Bed004	uh SmartKom, i- that - that actually  uses  constructions and is able to tell  from  this  construction	no
9877	transcript	transcript_Bed004	The SmartKom.	no
9878	transcript	transcript_Bed004	that there's uh something about the intent - you know, the actual what people wanna do or what they're referring to and stuff,	no
9879	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Mm-hmm.	no
9880	transcript	transcript_Bed004	in- independent of	no
9881	transcript	transcript_Bed004	whether it - about - what is this or where is it or something,	no
9882	transcript	transcript_Bed004	that you could tell  from  the construction, you could pull out deep semantic information which you're gonna use in a general  way.	no
9883	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Somehow you'd know that you needed to find out whether there - something was a landmark or something like that?	no
9884	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So that's the -	no
9885	transcript	transcript_Bed004	You  might.	no
9886	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah.	no
9887	transcript	transcript_Bed004	You might.	no
9888	transcript	transcript_Bed004	You might be able to - to uh	no
9889	transcript	transcript_Bed004	say that this i- this is the  kind  of construction	no
9890	transcript	transcript_Bed004	in which the -	no
9891	transcript	transcript_Bed004	there's - Let's say there's a uh cont-	no
9892	transcript	transcript_Bed004	there - the - the land-	no
9893	transcript	transcript_Bed004	the construction  implies  the there's a con- this thing is being viewed as a  container.	no
9894	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Mmm.	no
9895	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K.	no
9896	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So just from this local construction	no
9897	transcript	transcript_Bed004	you know that you're gonna  hafta  treat it as a container you might as well go off and get that information. And that may effect the way you process everything else.	no
9898	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"So if you say ""how do I get  into  the castle"""	no
9899	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K,	no
9900	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Right.	no
9901	transcript	transcript_Bed004	then um -	no
9902	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"Or,  you know, ""what  is  there in the castle"" or - so there's all sorts of things you might ask"	no
9903	transcript	transcript_Bed004	that involve the castle as a  container	no
9904	transcript	transcript_Bed004	and you'd  like  to have this  orthogonal  so that  anytime  the castle's referred to as a container,	no
9905	transcript	transcript_Bed004	you crank up the appropriate stuff.	no
9906	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Right.	no
9907	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Independent of what the  goal  is, and independent of what the surrounding  language  is.	no
9908	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Mm-hmm.	no
9909	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Alright, so that's - that's the - that's the thesis level uh -	no
9910	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Mm-hmm.	no
9911	transcript	transcript_Bed004	It's unfortunate also that English has sort of got rid of most of its spatial adverbs	no
9912	transcript	transcript_Bed004	because they're really fancy then, in - in -	no
9913	transcript	transcript_Bed004	for these kinds of analysis.	no
9914	transcript	transcript_Bed004	But uh.	no
9915	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Well, you have prepositional phrases that -	no
9916	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah, but they're - they're easier for  parsers.  Parsers can pick those up but - but the - with the spatial adverbs,	no
9917	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Right.	no
9918	transcript	transcript_Bed004	they have a tough time. Because the -	no
9919	transcript	transcript_Bed004	mean- the semantics are very complex in that.	no
9920	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Right.	no
9921	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K, yeah?	no
9922	transcript	transcript_Bed004	I had one more  thing. I don't remember. I just forgot it again.	no
9923	transcript	transcript_Bed004	No .	no
9924	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Oh yeah, b- But an architecture like this would also enable us maybe to - to throw this away and - and replace it with something else, or whatever, so that we have - so that this is sort of the representational formats we're - we're - we're talking about that are independent of the problem,	no
9925	transcript	transcript_Bed004	that generalize over those problems, and are	no
9926	transcript	transcript_Bed004	oh, t- of a higher quality than an- any actual whatever um	no
9927	transcript	transcript_Bed004	belief-net, or	no
9928	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"""X_"" that we may use for the decision making,"	no
9929	transcript	transcript_Bed004	ultimately.	no
9930	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Should be decoupled, yeah.	no
9931	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K.	no
9932	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Right.	no
9933	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So, are we gonna be meeting  here  from now on? I'm - I'm happy to  do  that. We - we had  talked  about it, cuz you have th- th- the display and everything, that seems fine.	yes
9934	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So, are we gonna be meeting  here  from now on? I'm - I'm happy to  do  that. We - we had  talked  about it, cuz you have th- th- the display and everything, that seems fine.	no
9935	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah, um, Liz also asks whether we're gonna have presentations  every  time. I don't think we will  need  to do that but it's - so far I think it was nice as a visual aid for some things and - and -	no
9936	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Right.	no
9937	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Oh yeah. No I -	no
9938	transcript	transcript_Bed004	I think it's worth it	no
9939	transcript	transcript_Bed004	to ass- to meet here	no
9940	transcript	transcript_Bed004	to bring this, and assume that something may come  up  that we wanna look at.	no
9941	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah.	no
9942	transcript	transcript_Bed004	I mean. Why not.	no
9943	transcript	transcript_Bed004	And um.	no
9944	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah, that was my -	no
9945	transcript	transcript_Bed004	She was  good.  Litonya was  good.	yes
9946	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah, that was my -	no
9947	transcript	transcript_Bed004	She was  good.  Litonya was  good.	no
9948	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah? The uh - um, she w- she was  definitely  good in the sense that she - she showed us some of the weaknesses	no
9949	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Right.	no
9950	transcript	transcript_Bed004	and um	no
9951	transcript	transcript_Bed004	also the um -	no
9952	transcript	transcript_Bed004	the fact that she was a  real  subject you know, is - is -	no
9953	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Right.	no
9954	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah, and - and - and - yeah and - and she took it seriously and stuff l- No, it was great.	no
9955	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah.	no
9956	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah.	no
9957	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So  I  think that um - I mean, w- Looking - just  looking  at this data,  listening  to it, what can we get out of it in terms of  our  problem,	no
9958	transcript	transcript_Bed004	for example, is, you know,	no
9959	transcript	transcript_Bed004	she actually m- said - you know,	no
9960	transcript	transcript_Bed004	she never s- just spoke about entering, she just wanted to get someplace, and she said for buying stuff.	no
9961	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Nuh?	no
9962	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So this is definitely interesting, and -	no
9963	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah, right.	no
9964	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Um, and in the other case, where she wanted to look at the stuff at the graffiti,	no
9965	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"also,  of course, not in the sentence ""How do you  get  there?"" was pretty standard."	no
9966	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Nuh?	no
9967	transcript	transcript_Bed004	except that there was a nice anaphora,	no
9968	transcript	transcript_Bed004	you know,	no
9969	transcript	transcript_Bed004	for pointing at what she talked about  before,  and there she was talking about looking at  pictures  that are painted inside a  wall-  on walls, so	no
9970	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Right.	no
9971	transcript	transcript_Bed004	"Actually, you'd need a lot of world knowledge. This would have been a classical um uh ""Tango"", actually. Um,"	no
9972	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yeah.	no
9973	transcript	transcript_Bed004	because graffiti is usually found on the  outside  and not on the  inside,  but	no
9974	transcript	transcript_Bed004	O_K.	no
9975	transcript	transcript_Bed004	So the mistake  would have make a mistake - the system would have made a mistake here.	no
9976	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Yep.	no
9977	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Click?	no
9978	transcript	transcript_Bed004	Alright.	yes
9979	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	st-	no
9980	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
9981	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So we're on.	no
9982	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	That's better.	no
9983	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And,  somewhere is my agenda.	no
9984	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I think the most important thing is Morgan wanted to talk about, uh,	no
9985	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the ARPA  demo.	no
9986	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, so,	no
9987	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	here's the thing.	no
9988	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Um,	no
9989	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	why don't we s- again start off with - with, uh,	no
9990	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	-n-	no
9991	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah, I'll get it.	no
9992	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I'll get the door.	no
9993	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Um,	no
9994	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I think we want to start off with the  agenda.	no
9995	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And then, given that,	no
9996	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh, Liz and Andreas are gonna be  ten, fifteen minutes late,	no
9997	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	we can try to figure out what we can	no
9998	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	do most effectively without them here. So -	no
9999	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K. So, uh -	no
10000	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So - so, one thing is, yeah, talk about demo,	no
10001	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh, I_B_M transcription status,	no
10002	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I_B_M transcription.	no
10003	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Uh, what else?	no
10004	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	SmartKom.	no
10005	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	SmartKom.	no
10006	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	SmartKom.	no
10007	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	What's SmartKom?	no
10008	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Uh, we wanna talk about	no
10009	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	if w-  if  we wanna add the data to the mar- Meeting Recorder corpus.	no
10010	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	The data.	no
10011	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	The data which we are collecting here.	no
10012	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	What - what - what are we collecting here?	no
10013	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Data?	no
10014	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So why don't we have that on the agenda and we'll - we'll get to it and talk about it?	no
10015	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	The SmartKom data?	no
10016	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah, right.	no
10017	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10018	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Uh,	no
10019	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	right.	no
10020	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Uh.	no
10021	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Uh, reorganization status.	no
10022	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Reorganization	no
10023	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	status.	no
10024	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Oh.	no
10025	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Files and directories?	no
10026	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Files and directories.	no
10027	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yep.	no
10028	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Uh-huh.	no
10029	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Absinthe,	no
10030	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	which is the multiprocessor UNIX -	no
10031	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Linux.	no
10032	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I think it was  Andreas wanted to talk about segmentation and recognition,	no
10033	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and update on S_R_I recognition experiments.	no
10034	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Um -	no
10035	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And then if ti- if there's  time  I wanted to talk about digits, but it looked like we were pretty full, so I can wait till next week.	no
10036	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
10037	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K.	no
10038	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, let's see.	no
10039	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I think the a- certainly the segmentation and recognition we wanna maybe focus on when An- Andreas is here since that was particularly his	no
10040	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And also the SmartKom	no
10041	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	thing.	no
10042	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	thing	no
10043	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	SmartKom also,	no
10044	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	should	no
10045	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	b-	no
10046	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Andreas.	no
10047	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Absinthe, I think also he	no
10048	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	has sort of been involved in a lot of those things. Yeah.	no
10049	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	At least,  yeah , he'll t- he'll probably be interested.	no
10050	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But.	no
10051	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10052	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Um	no
10053	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So, I mean, I think they'll be inter- I'll be interested in all this, but -	no
10054	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	but, uh, probably,	no
10055	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	if we had to pick  something   that we would talk on for	no
10056	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	ten minutes or so while they're coming here. Or I guess it would be,	no
10057	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	you think, reorganization status, or - ?	yes
10058	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	you think, reorganization status, or - ?	no
10059	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah. I mean, I think,	no
10060	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Chuck was the one who	no
10061	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	added out the agenda item. I don't really have anything to  say  other than that we still haven't  done  it.	no
10062	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So.	no
10063	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, I mean, I uh -	no
10064	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	just basically that -	no
10065	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	maybe I said - maybe we said this before - just that we met and we talked about it and	no
10066	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	we	no
10067	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	sort of have a plan for	no
10068	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	getting things organized and -	no
10069	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And I - and I think a crucial part of that is the idea of - of not wanting to do it until right before the next level zero back-up	no
10070	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	so that there won't be huge number of -	no
10071	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
10072	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	of added, uh -	no
10073	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
10074	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	That - that was basically it. Not - not much  @@  -	no
10075	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Although Dave basically said	no
10076	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10077	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	that	no
10078	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	if we wanna  do  it,	no
10079	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Uh-huh.	no
10080	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	just  tell  him and he'll	no
10081	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	do a d- level zero then.	no
10082	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Oh, excellent.	no
10083	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So.	no
10084	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Oh, so maybe we  should   just go ahead and get everything ready, and -	no
10085	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Oh, good.	no
10086	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yep.	no
10087	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So, I think we  do  need to talk a little bit about -	no
10088	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, we don't need to do it during this meeting. We have a  little  more to discuss.	no
10089	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10090	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But, uh,	no
10091	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	we're - we're basically ready to do it.	no
10092	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And, uh, I have some web pages on	no
10093	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	ts-	no
10094	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	more of the background.	no
10095	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So, naming conventions and things like that, that I've been trying to keep actually up to date.	no
10096	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So.	no
10097	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And I've been  sharing   them with U_d- U_W folks also.	no
10098	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K.	no
10099	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I'm sorry, you've been what? Showing them?  Sharing  them. O_K.	no
10100	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Sharing  them with the U_W folks.	no
10101	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K.	no
10102	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K.	no
10103	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, maybe uh,	no
10104	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	since that - that was a pretty short one, maybe we should talk about the I_B_M transcription status. Someone can	no
10105	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	fill in Liz and Andreas later. Uh	no
10106	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K. So, we, uh -	yes
10107	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	fill in Liz and Andreas later. Uh	no
10108	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K. So, we, uh -	no
10109	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	we did another version of the beeps, where we separated each beeps with a spoken digit.	no
10110	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Chuck came up here and recorded some di- himself speaking some digits,	no
10111	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and so it just	no
10112	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	"goes ""beep one beep"" and then the phrase, and then ""beep two beep"" and then the phrase."	no
10113	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And that seems pretty good.	no
10114	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Um,	no
10115	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I think	no
10116	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	they'll have a b- easier time keeping track of where they are in the file.	no
10117	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And we have done that on the  automatic	no
10118	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	segmentations.	no
10119	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And we did it with the automatic segmentation, and I don't think - We ne- we didn't look at it in detail.	no
10120	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	We just sent it to I_B_M. We - we sorta  spot-checked  it.	no
10121	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I listened to  probably,	no
10122	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10123	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh, five or ten minutes of it from the beginning.	no
10124	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Oh, really? O_K.	no
10125	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10126	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And -	no
10127	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I sorta spot-checked here and there and it sounded pretty good.	no
10128	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So.	no
10129	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K.	no
10130	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I think it'll work.	no
10131	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And, uh, we'll just hafta	no
10132	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	see what we get back from them.	no
10133	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Uh -	no
10134	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And the main thing will be	no
10135	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	if we can	no
10136	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	align  what they give us	no
10137	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	with what we sent them.	no
10138	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I mean, that's the crucial	no
10139	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	part.	no
10140	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
10141	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And I think	no
10142	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	we'll be able to do that at - with this new	no
10143	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	beep	no
10144	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	format.	no
10145	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yep.	no
10146	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, I think	no
10147	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	it's also	no
10148	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	they are	no
10149	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	much less likely to d- have errors.	no
10150	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	no
10151	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I mean, so the problem wi- last time is that there were errors in the transcripts where they  put  beeps where there weren't any,	no
10152	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
10153	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	or - and they put in extraneous beeps.	no
10154	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10155	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And with the numbers there, it's much less likely.	no
10156	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah, one	no
10157	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	interesting note is -	no
10158	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh, or problem - I dunno if this was just	no
10159	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	because of how  I  play it back, I say, uh, S_N_D-play and then the file,	no
10160	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	every once in a while,	no
10161	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	@@   uh, like a beep sounds like it's  cut  into two beeps.	no
10162	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah. Into two pieces. Yeah.	no
10163	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah, and	no
10164	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yep.	no
10165	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I - I dunno if that's an, uh, artifact of playback -	no
10166	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	bu- uh, I don't think it's probably in the original file.	no
10167	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Um,	no
10168	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I recognize that, too.	no
10169	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10170	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	but, uh -	no
10171	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Ha. That's interesting. I didn't hear that.	no
10172	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10173	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But with this new format,	no
10174	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um,	no
10175	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	that	no
10176	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	hopefully  they're  not hearing that, and if they are, it shouldn't throw them.	no
10177	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yep.	no
10178	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So.	no
10179	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, maybe we better listen to it again, make sure, but,	no
10180	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I mean, certainly the software shouldn't	no
10181	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	do that, so.	no
10182	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah. That's what I thought. I- it's probably just,	no
10183	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	no
10184	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	you know,	no
10185	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	mmm, somehow the	no
10186	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	audio  device	no
10187	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	gets	no
10188	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah. Some latency or something. Yeah?	no
10189	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Hiccups.	no
10190	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	hung for a second, or -	no
10191	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10192	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	As long as they have one number,	no
10193	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and they know that there's only one beep maximum	no
10194	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10195	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10196	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	that goes with that number.	no
10197	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah. The only - the only part that might be confusing is when Chuck is reading digits.	no
10198	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
10199	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yep.	no
10200	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
10201	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So  th-	no
10202	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, you know,  actually,	no
10203	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	"""Seven four eight  beep  seven  beep   eight three two""."	no
10204	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	are we having them -	no
10205	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah, but are we having them do digits?	no
10206	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yes.	no
10207	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Because, uh, we don't -	no
10208	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	We - we didn't cut those out.	no
10209	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10210	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	we didn't -	no
10211	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	They are not transcribed yet. So. Yeah.	no
10212	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	In order to cut them out we'd have to listen to it.	no
10213	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10214	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And we wanted to avoid doing that, so we - they are transcribing the digits.	no
10215	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K.	no
10216	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K.	no
10217	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K.	no
10218	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Although we  could  tell them -	no
10219	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	We can - we can ignore it	no
10220	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	when we get it back, huh.	no
10221	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	we could tell them,	no
10222	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	if you hear someone reading a digits string just say	no
10223	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	"""bracket digit bracket"" and don't bother actually"	no
10224	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	computing the di-	no
10225	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	writing down the digits.	no
10226	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10227	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	That'd be great. That'd be what I'm having	no
10228	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the transcribers here do, cuz it can be	no
10229	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	extracted later.	no
10230	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yep.	yes
10231	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yep.	no
10232	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And then I wanted to  talk  about -	no
10233	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	but as I said I - we may not have  time  -	no
10234	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	what we should  do  about digits. We have a whole pile of digits that haven't been transcribed.	no
10235	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Le- let's talk about it, because	no
10236	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	that's - that's something that I - I know Andreas is less interested in than Liz is, so,	no
10237	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K.	no
10238	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	you know.	no
10239	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Do we have anything else to say about transcription?	no
10240	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	It's good -	no
10241	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	About I_B_M stuff?	no
10242	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Uh, Brian - I -	no
10243	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I  sent  bresset   -   sent  Brian  a  message  about   the meeting	no
10244	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and I haven't heard back yet.	no
10245	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So.	no
10246	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K.	no
10247	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I g- hope he got it and hopefully he's -	no
10248	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Hmm.	no
10249	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	maybe he's gone, I dunno. He didn't	no
10250	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	even reply to my message. So.	no
10251	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I should probably ping him just to make sure that	no
10252	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	he got it.	no
10253	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Alright.	no
10254	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	@@	no
10255	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So, we have a whole bunch of digits,	no
10256	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	if we wanna move on to digits.	no
10257	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Actually, maybe I - One - one relate- more related thing in transcription. So that's the I_B_M stuff. We've got that sorted out.	no
10258	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Um, how're we doing on the - on the rest of it?	no
10259	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	We're doing well.	no
10260	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I - I hire - I've hired  two  extra people already, expect to hire two more.	no
10261	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Hmm.	no
10262	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And, um,	no
10263	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I've prepared,	no
10264	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um,	no
10265	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh, a set of  five  which I'm - which I'm calling set two,	no
10266	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	which are now being edited by my head transcriber,	no
10267	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	in terms of spelling errors and all that. She's also checking through and mar- and -	no
10268	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and monitoring, um,	no
10269	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the transcription of	no
10270	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	another transcriber.	no
10271	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	You know, I mean, she's going through and doing these kinds of checks.	no
10272	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Uh-huh.	no
10273	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And,	no
10274	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I've moved on now to what I'm calling set three. I sort of thought if I do it in sets - groups of five,	no
10275	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	then I can have, like, sort of a -	no
10276	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	a parallel processing through - through the -	no
10277	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Uh-huh.	no
10278	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the current.	no
10279	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And -	no
10280	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and you indicated to me that we have a g- a  goal  now,	no
10281	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	for the -	no
10282	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	for the,	no
10283	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um,	no
10284	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the, uh, DARPA  demo,	no
10285	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	of twenty hours.	no
10286	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So, I'm gonna go up to twenty hours,	no
10287	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	be sure that everything gets processed,	no
10288	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and released,	no
10289	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and -	no
10290	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and that's -	no
10291	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	that's what my goal is. Package of twenty hours right now,	no
10292	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and then once that's done, move on to the next.	no
10293	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah, uh,	no
10294	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	so twenty hours. But I guess the other thing is that,	no
10295	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um,	no
10296	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	that - that's kinda twenty hours A_SAP because	no
10297	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the longer	no
10298	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	before  the demo we actually have the twenty hours, the more time it'll be for people to actually do	no
10299	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	cool things with it.	no
10300	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	no
10301	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So.	no
10302	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Good.	no
10303	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I'm - I'm hiring people who,	no
10304	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K.	no
10305	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh,  really  are -	no
10306	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	They would like to do it full-time, several of these people.	no
10307	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	no
10308	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And - and I don't think it's	no
10309	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	possible, really, to do this full-time, but,	no
10310	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	that - what it shows is motivation to do as many hours as possible.	no
10311	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	It'll keep your accuracy up.	no
10312	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yep.	no
10313	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10314	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10315	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And they're really excellent.	no
10316	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, that's good.	no
10317	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10318	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah, I mean, I guess the -	no
10319	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Got a good core group now.	no
10320	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So the difference if - if, um,	no
10321	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	if the I_B_M stuff works out,	no
10322	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Again.	no
10323	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the difference in the job would be that they p- primarily would be	no
10324	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	checking through things that were	no
10325	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	no
10326	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	already done by someone else? Is that most of what it - ?	no
10327	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And correcting.	no
10328	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I mean -	no
10329	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Correcting.	no
10330	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Correcting. We'll - we'll expect that they'll have to move some time bins and do some corrections.	no
10331	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And I - you know, I've also d- uh, discovered -	no
10332	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So with the new transcriber I'm -	no
10333	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um -	no
10334	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So -	no
10335	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Uh, lemme say that	no
10336	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	my,	no
10337	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh -	no
10338	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So,	no
10339	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um -	no
10340	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	At present, um, the people have been doing these transcriptions a channel at a time.	no
10341	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And, that sort of, um,  is useful, and t- you know, and then once in a while they'll have to refer to the other channels to clear something up.	no
10342	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K. Well,	no
10343	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I realize that, um,	no
10344	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	w- i- we- we're using the pre-segmented version,	no
10345	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and, um,	no
10346	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the pre-segmented version is extremely useful,	no
10347	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and wouldn't it be,	no
10348	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	useful also to have the  visual  representation of those segments?	no
10349	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And so I've -	no
10350	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh,  I,	no
10351	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh, uh, I've   trained  the new one -	no
10352	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh, the new- the newest one,	no
10353	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	to, um,	no
10354	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	use the	no
10355	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	visual from	no
10356	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the channel that is gonna be transcribed at any given time.	no
10357	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And that's just  amazingly  helpful.	no
10358	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Because what happens  then,  is you scan across the signal and once in a while you'll find a blip that didn't show up in the pre-segmentation.	no
10359	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Oh, right. I see what you mean.	no
10360	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And that'll be something like -	no
10361	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I- it's  ver-  - it's interesting.	no
10362	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	A backchannel, or -	no
10363	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Once in a while it's a backchannel. Sometimes it seems to be,	no
10364	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yep.	no
10365	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um,	no
10366	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	similar  to the ones that are being picked up.	no
10367	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	no
10368	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And they're rare events, but you can  really  go through a meeting  very  quickly. You just - you just,	no
10369	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	you know,	no
10370	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	yo- you s-	no
10371	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	you  scroll   from screen to screen, looking for blips.	no
10372	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And,	no
10373	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10374	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I think that we're gonna end up with, uh  better coverage of the backchannels,	no
10375	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	but at the same time we're benefitting	no
10376	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	tremendously from the pre-segmentation because	no
10377	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	there are  huge  places where there is just absolutely	no
10378	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	no	no
10379	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	activity at all.	no
10380	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	no
10381	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And, uh, the audio quality is  so  good -	no
10382	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So they can - they can, um,	no
10383	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	scroll through that pretty quick?	no
10384	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10385	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	no
10386	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	That's great.	no
10387	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10388	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So I think that that's gonna,	no
10389	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	also  eh,  you know, speed the efficiency of this	no
10390	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	part of the process.	no
10391	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Hmm. O_K.	no
10392	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Uh, yeah.	no
10393	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So, uh -	no
10394	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah. So let's talk about the digits, since they're not here yet.	yes
10395	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah. So let's talk about the digits, since they're not here yet.	no
10396	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Uh, so,	no
10397	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	we have a whole bunch of digits that we've read and we have the forms and so on,	no
10398	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um, but only a small number of that ha-	no
10399	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	well, not a  small  number -	no
10400	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	only	no
10401	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	a  subset  of that has been transcribed. And so we need to decide	no
10402	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	what we wanna  do.	no
10403	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And, uh,	no
10404	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Liz and Andreas - actually they're not here, but,	no
10405	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	they did say at one point that they thought they could do a pretty good job of just doing a forced alignment.	no
10406	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And,	no
10407	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	again, I don't think we'll be able to do with that  alone,	no
10408	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	because, um, sometimes people correct themselves and things like that.	no
10409	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But - so, I was just wondering what people thought about	no
10410	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	how automated can we make the  process  of finding where the people read the digits,	no
10411	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	doing a forced alignment, and doing the timing.	no
10412	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, forced alignment would be one thing. What about just actually doing recognition?	no
10413	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, we - we  know  what they read, because we have the forms.	no
10414	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	No, they make mistakes.	no
10415	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
10416	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But,	no
10417	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the  point  is that we wanna  get  a set of clean	no
10418	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	digits.	no
10419	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
10420	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	You're talking about as a  pre-processing  step. Right, Morgan?	no
10421	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Um -	no
10422	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Is that what you're - ?	no
10423	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah, I'm - I'm not quite sure what I'm talking about. I mean -	no
10424	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I -	no
10425	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I mean,	no
10426	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh, we're talking about digits now. And - and so,	no
10427	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um,	no
10428	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	there's a bunch of stuff that hasn't been	no
10429	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	marked yet.	no
10430	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Uh.	no
10431	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And,	no
10432	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um,	no
10433	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I mean, so one option i-	no
10434	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	there's the issue that -	no
10435	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	that they - we know what -	no
10436	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	what was said,	no
10437	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	but do we? Because people	no
10438	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	make mistakes and stuff.	no
10439	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I was just  asking,  just out of curiosity, if - if with, uh -	no
10440	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh, the S_R_I recognizer getting one percent word error,	no
10441	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh,	no
10442	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	would we -	no
10443	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	would we do   better  - ?	no
10444	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So, if you do a forced alignment but the force- but the - but the transcription you have is wrong because they actually made mistakes, uh, or	no
10445	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But that's pretty uncommon.	no
10446	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	false starts,	no
10447	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	it's - it's much less c-	no
10448	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	it's  much less common than one percent?	no
10449	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Um,	no
10450	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	if we could really get one percent on -	no
10451	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well,	no
10452	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	We should be able to. Right?	no
10453	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I guess - yeah, I guess if we  segmented  it,	no
10454	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10455	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	we could get one percent on digits.	no
10456	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10457	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So that's just my question. I'm not saying it should be one way or the other, but it's - If -	no
10458	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But,	no
10459	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, there - there're a couple different of doing it. We could	no
10460	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	use the tools I've already developed and transcribe it. Hire some people,	no
10461	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	or use the transcribers to do it. We could let I_B_M transcribe it.	no
10462	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	You know, they're doing it anyway, and unless we tell them  different,  they're gonna transcribe it.	no
10463	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Um, or we could try some automated methods.	no
10464	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And  my  - my tendency right  now  is, well, if I_B_M	no
10465	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well -	no
10466	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	comes back with this meeting and the transcript is  good,	no
10467	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	just let  them  do it.	no
10468	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah, it's - Y- you raised a point, kind of,	no
10469	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh, euphemistically - but, I mean, m- maybe it is a serious problem. Ho- what will they do when they go - hear	no
10470	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	"""beep  seven  beep  seven three five two"" - I mean,"	no
10471	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	you think they'll - we'll get - ?	no
10472	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	It's pretty distinct.	no
10473	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	The beeps are  pre-recorded.	no
10474	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah?	no
10475	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	It'll  only be a problem for m- for mine.	no
10476	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10477	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well it -	no
10478	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	"it - well, it'd be preceded by ""I'm reading transcript"	no
10479	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	"so-and-so""?"	no
10480	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10481	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yes.	no
10482	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So,	no
10483	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I	no
10484	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	think if they're processing it at -	no
10485	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I mean, it'll be - it will be in the midst of a digit string.	no
10486	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So -	no
10487	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10488	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I mean it - sure, there - there might be a place where it's	no
10489	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	"""beep seven  beep eight"	no
10490	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	beep	no
10491	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	"eight  beep""."	no
10492	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But, you know, they - they're - they're gonna macros for inserting the beep marks.	no
10493	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And so, I - I don't think it'll be a problem. We'll have to see, but I don't think it's gonna be a problem.	no
10494	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K.	no
10495	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, I - I - I dunno, I - I think that that's - if they are in fact going to transcribe these things,	no
10496	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh,	no
10497	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	certainly any process that we'd have to	no
10498	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	correct them, or whatever is - needs to be much less elaborate for digits than	no
10499	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
10500	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	for other stuff. So, why not?	no
10501	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Sure.	no
10502	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	That was it?	no
10503	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	That was it.	no
10504	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Just,	no
10505	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	what do we do with digits? We have so many of them,	no
10506	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K.	no
10507	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, we - we -	no
10508	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and it'd be nice to  actually do something with them.	no
10509	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	we wanna have  them.	no
10510	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	You mean there're more than ten?	no
10511	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah, I -	no
10512	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Anything else?	no
10513	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Your mike is a little low there.	no
10514	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I- in Berkeley, yeah.	no
10515	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So,	no
10516	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh	no
10517	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	You - you have to go a  little   early, right?	no
10518	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, I can stay till about, uh,	no
10519	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	At twenty -	no
10520	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	three forty.	no
10521	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Alright. So le- let's make sure we do the ones that -	no
10522	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10523	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	no
10524	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	that, uh,	yes
10525	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	no
10526	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	that, uh,	no
10527	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	saved you. So there was some -	no
10528	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Uh	no
10529	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	In -	no
10530	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	in -	no
10531	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Adam's agenda list, he had something from you about segmentation this last recognition?	no
10532	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, yeah. So this is just	no
10533	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	partly to inform everybody,	no
10534	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Oops.	no
10535	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um,	no
10536	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and - and of course to get,	no
10537	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um,	no
10538	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	input.	no
10539	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Um,	no
10540	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	so,	no
10541	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh, we had a discussion -	no
10542	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Don and	no
10543	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Liz and I had discussion last week about	no
10544	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	how to proceed with, uh,	no
10545	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Ch-	no
10546	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	you know, with  Don's  work, and -	no
10547	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and - and, uh, one of	no
10548	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the obvious	no
10549	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	things that	no
10550	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	occur to us was that	no
10551	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	we're - since we now have Thilo's	no
10552	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	segmenter and it works,	no
10553	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	you know, amazingly well,	no
10554	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um,	no
10555	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	we should actually	no
10556	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	basically re-evaluate the recognition,	no
10557	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um,	no
10558	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	results	no
10559	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	using - you know, without cheating on the segmentations.	no
10560	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And, that should be fairly -	no
10561	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So -	no
10562	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And how do we find the transcripts for  those   so that - ?	no
10563	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10564	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Oh, O_K.	no
10565	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	The references for - for  those segments?	no
10566	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So, there's actually -	no
10567	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	It's not that -	no
10568	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Why do you ask?	no
10569	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	No, actually, um,	no
10570	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I could -	no
10571	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well -	no
10572	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Hand ones.	no
10573	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	NIST	no
10574	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	has,	no
10575	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um	no
10576	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	m-	no
10577	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	a fairly sophisticated scoring program	no
10578	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K.	no
10579	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	that you can give a, um -	no
10580	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	a time,	no
10581	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh -	no
10582	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	You know, you basically just give two  time-marked sequences of words,	no
10583	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and it	no
10584	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	computes	no
10585	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the	no
10586	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um -	no
10587	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the,	no
10588	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh -	no
10589	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	you know,	no
10590	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	It does all the work for you.	no
10591	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the - the - th- it does all the work for you.	no
10592	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10593	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K.	no
10594	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So, it - we just - and we use that actually in Hub-five	no
10595	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	to do the scoring.	no
10596	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Um. So what we've been using so far was sort of a  simplified version of the scoring.	no
10597	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And we can -	no
10598	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	we can handle the -	no
10599	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the - the	no
10600	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	type of problem we have here.	no
10601	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So, we ha-	no
10602	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So, basically you give some time constraints for - for the references and for - for the hypothesis, and - Yeah, O_K.	no
10603	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10604	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
10605	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
10606	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah. Maybe the  start of your speech and the end of it, or stuff like that.	no
10607	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So do-	no
10608	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K.	no
10609	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
10610	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	It does time-constrained word-alignment.	no
10611	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K.	no
10612	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So.	no
10613	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So that	no
10614	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	should be possible.	no
10615	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I mean that shouldn't be a	no
10616	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	problem.	no
10617	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Uh, so that was the one thing, and the other was that, um -	no
10618	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	What was the other problem? Oh!	no
10619	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	That	no
10620	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Thilo wanted to use  the recognizer alignments to train up his, um, speech detector.	no
10621	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10622	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Um,	no
10623	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	so that	no
10624	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	we could use,	no
10625	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh - you know there wouldn't be so much hand	no
10626	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	labeling needed	no
10627	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	to, uh -	no
10628	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	to generate training data for - for the speech detector.	no
10629	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah. I'm just in progress of - of doing that. So.	no
10630	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And I think you're in the  process   of doing that. So,	no
10631	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10632	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	you can -	no
10633	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	It'll give you a lot more data, too. Won't it?	no
10634	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	you can -	no
10635	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10636	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So, it's basically -	no
10637	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	s-	no
10638	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I think, eight meetings or something which - which I'm using, and,	no
10639	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	no
10640	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	it's -	no
10641	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	before it was twenty minutes of one meeting. So -	no
10642	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
10643	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	should  be a little bit better.	no
10644	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	That won't be perfect - the alignments aren't perfect,	no
10645	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Great.	no
10646	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah. But -	no
10647	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	but,	no
10648	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um,	no
10649	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10650	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	it's probably still  better  to have all this extra data,	no
10651	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10652	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yep.	no
10653	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	than - Yeah.	no
10654	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	We'll see that.	no
10655	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10656	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K.	no
10657	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Actually, I had a question about that. If you find that you can	no
10658	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	lower the false alarms	no
10659	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	that you get	no
10660	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	where there's no speech, that would be	no
10661	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	useful  for us to know. So,	no
10662	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um -	no
10663	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	There were the false alarms.	no
10664	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah. So,	no
10665	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	r- right now you get f-	no
10666	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K.	no
10667	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	fal- you know, false - false, uh, speech regions when it's just like, um,	no
10668	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10669	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	breath or something like that, and I'd be interested to know the -	no
10670	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yep.	no
10671	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	wha- if you retrain	no
10672	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um,	no
10673	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10674	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	do those actually go down or not? Because   of  -	no
10675	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah. I'll - can make - an-	no
10676	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	can, like, make a c- comparison of - of the old system to the - to the new one, and  then - Yeah.	no
10677	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah, just to see if by doing nothing in the modeling of - just having that training data wh- what happens.	no
10678	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10679	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yep.	no
10680	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Um  another   one that we had on	no
10681	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Adam's agenda  that	no
10682	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	definitely involved you was s- something about SmartKom?	no
10683	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right. So,	yes
10684	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right. So,	no
10685	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Rob  Porzel   - eh,  Porzel?	no
10686	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and the, uh -	no
10687	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Porzel.	no
10688	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Porzel   -	no
10689	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Porzel.	no
10690	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and the, uh,	no
10691	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	SmartKom group are collecting some dialogues. Basically they have one person sitting in here,	no
10692	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	looking at a picture, and a wizard sitting in another room somewhere.	no
10693	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And, uh, they're doing a travel task.	no
10694	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And, uh,	no
10695	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	it involves starting - I believe starting with a -	no
10696	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	It's - it's always the wizard, but it starts where the wizard is pretending to be a computer and it goes through a, uh,	no
10697	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	speech generation system.	no
10698	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah. Actually, it's changed to a synthesis for - for the first part now. Yeah.	no
10699	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Synthesis system.	no
10700	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Um, and then,	no
10701	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	it goes to a real wizard and they're	no
10702	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	evaluating  that. And they wanted to use this equipment,	no
10703	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and so the w-  question  came up, is - well, here's some more data. Should this be part of the  corpus  or not?	no
10704	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And  my  attitude was  yes,  because there might be people	no
10705	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	who are using this corpus for  acoustics, as opposed to just for language.	no
10706	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Um, or also for  dialogue  of various sorts.	no
10707	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Um, so it's not	no
10708	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	a  meeting.  Right? Because it's	no
10709	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	two people and they're not face to face.	no
10710	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Wait a minute.  So,	no
10711	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10712	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I just wanted to understand it, cuz I -	no
10713	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I'm -	no
10714	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh, hadn't quite followed this	no
10715	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	process. Um.	no
10716	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So,	no
10717	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	it's wizard in the sen- usual sense that the person who is	no
10718	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	asking the questions doesn't know that it's, uh, a machi- not a machine?	no
10719	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
10720	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Actually - actually,	no
10721	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	At the beginning.	no
10722	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	w- w-	no
10723	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the - the - We do this - I dunno who came up with it, but I think it's a really clever idea.	no
10724	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	We simulate a computer breakdown	no
10725	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10726	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	halfway through the session,	no
10727	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and so then after that,	no
10728	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the person's told that they're now talking to a,	no
10729	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh -	no
10730	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	It's a human operator.	no
10731	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	to a human.	no
10732	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10733	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10734	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But of course they don't know that it's the same person both times.	no
10735	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So, we - we collect - we collect both human-computer and human-human data,	no
10736	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	essentially, in the same	no
10737	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	session.	no
10738	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	You   might wanna try	no
10739	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	collecting it the other way around sometime, saying that th- the computer isn't up yet and then - so then you can separate it out whether it's the beginning or end kind of effects. But, yeah.	no
10740	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Hmm.	no
10741	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	That's an idea.	no
10742	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yep.	no
10743	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10744	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	That's   a good idea.	no
10745	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	"""I have to go now. You can talk to the computer."""	no
10746	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	"""No!"""	no
10747	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	It's a lot more believable, too, if you tell  them   that they're -	no
10748	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the computer part is running on a Windows machine.	no
10749	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And the whole breakdown thing kinda makes sense.	no
10750	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O-	no
10751	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Just -	no
10752	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	just reboot it.	no
10753	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Abort -	no
10754	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	abort, retry, fail?	no
10755	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So did they actually save the far-field  data? Cuz at first they weren't -	no
10756	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	"Well, this was - this was the question. So - so they were saying they were not going to, and I said, ""well that's silly, if - if we're gonna try to do it for a corpus,"	no

10777	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Nnn.	no
10778	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	that if we  have  someone who is doing  acoustic  studies,	no
10779	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Hmm.	no
10780	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10781	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh, it's nice to have	no
10782	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the  same  for every recording.	no
10783	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So, what is the purpose of this recording?	no
10784	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	no
10785	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	This is to	no
10786	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	It's to be traini- to b- training data and development data for the SmartKom  system.	no
10787	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	The English system?	no

10789	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	acoustic   and language model	no
10790	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10791	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10792	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	training data for SmartKom.	no
10793	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
10794	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
10795	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K.	no
10796	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Where does this - ?	no
10797	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Maybe we can have him vary the microphones, too, or they're different s- speakers.	no
10798	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well,	no
10799	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	B-	no
10800	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right. So - so - so for  their  usage, they don't need anything.	no
10801	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	so why not - ?	no
10802	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah. But - but I'm not sure about the legal aspect of - of that. Is - is there some contract with SmartKom or something about the data? What	no
10803	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right?	no
10804	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10805	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	they - or, is - is that  our  data which we are collecting here, or - ?	no
10806	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	We've never signed anything that said that	no
10807	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K.	no
10808	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	we couldn't use anything that we did.	no
10809	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K.	no
10810	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	We weren't supposed to collect any data.	no
10811	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So.	no
10812	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K.	no
10813	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	This was all -	no
10814	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10815	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So. Yeah, th- th- that was the question. If - if - ? Yeah.	no
10816	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10817	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Basically.	no
10818	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	No  that's  not a problem. I - L- look, it seems to me that if we're doing it anyway and we're doing it for these - these purposes that we have,	no
10819	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	no
10820	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and we have these distant mikes, we definitely should re-	no
10821	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	should	no
10822	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	save it all as long as we've got disk space, and disk is pretty cheap. So should we  save  it?	no
10823	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K.	no
10824	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And then -	no
10825	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Now th- Yeah.	no
10826	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So we save it because it's - it - it's potentially useful.	no
10827	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
10828	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And now,	no
10829	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	what do we do with it is - is a s- separate question.	no
10830	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I mean, anybody who's training something up could	no
10831	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	choose	no
10832	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	to put it -	no
10833	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
10834	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	eh, to u- include this or not. I - I would not say it was part of the meetings corpus. It isn't.	no
10835	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But it's some other data we have, and if somebody	no
10836	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	doing experiment wants to train up including that then they can. Right?	no
10837	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	no
10838	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So it's -	no
10839	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	It -	no
10840	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	it -	no
10841	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I guess it - the -	no
10842	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	begs the question of what is the meeting corpus. So if,	no
10843	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	at U_W they start recording	no
10844	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	two-person	no
10845	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I think it's - I -	no
10846	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	hallway conversations is that	no
10847	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	part of the meeting corpus?	no
10848	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I think - I th- think the idea of two or more people conversing with one another is key.	no
10849	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, this has two or more people conversing with each other. They're just not face to face.	no
10850	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Nnn, well	no
10851	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10852	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	What if we just give it a -	no
10853	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well this -	no
10854	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	No, it doesn't. Right? It has -	no
10855	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	a name like we give these meetings a name?	no
10856	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I mean, that was my intention.	no
10857	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And then later on some people will consider it a meeting and some people won't, and -	no
10858	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10859	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	That was my intention. So - so - s-	no
10860	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well this -	no
10861	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Just give it a	no
10862	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	so  part  of the reason that I wanted to bring this up is,	no
10863	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	title.	no
10864	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	do we wanna  handle  it as a special case or do we wanna  fold  it in,	no
10865	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Oh.	no
10866	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I think it is a s-	no
10867	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	we- give everyone who's involved as	no
10868	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	their own user I_D, give it session I_Ds,	no
10869	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	let all the tools that handle Meeting Recorder handle it,	no
10870	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	or do we wanna special case it? And if we were gonna special case it,	no
10871	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well,	no
10872	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So. It - it - it -	no
10873	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	it -	no
10874	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	who's gonna do that?	no
10875	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	it makes sense to handle it	no
10876	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I think -	no
10877	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	with the same infrastructure, since we don't want to duplicate things unnecessarily. But as far as	no
10878	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	distributing it, we shouldn't label it as part of this	no
10879	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	meeting corpus. We should	no
10880	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10881	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	let it be its own corp-	no
10882	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I don't see why not. It's just a different topic.	no
10883	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well it's - it - well, because -	no
10884	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I ha- I have an extra point, which is the naturalness issue.	no
10885	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Because we have, like, meetings that have a reason. That's one of the reasons that we were	no
10886	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	talking about this. And - and those -	no
10887	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10888	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and this sounds like it's more of an experimental setup. It's got a different purpose.	no
10889	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	It's scenario-based, it's - it's human-computer interface -	no
10890	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	it's really	no
10891	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	pretty different. But I- I - I have no problem with somebody folding it in	no
10892	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10893	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	for some experiment they're gonna do, but I don't think	no
10894	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	i- it - it doesn't match anything that we've described about meetings.	no
10895	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	no
10896	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Whereas everything that we talked about them doing at - at U_W and so forth really  does.  They're actually talking -	no
10897	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K. So w- so what does that  mean  for how we are gonna organize things?	no
10898	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Hmm.	no
10899	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10900	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	You can - you can - Again, as - as I think Andreas was saying,	no
10901	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	if you wanna use the same	no
10902	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	tools  and the same conventions, there's no problem with that. It's just that it's, you know, different directory, it's called something different, it's - you know.	no
10903	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	It is  different.	no
10904	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	You can't just fold it in as if it's - I mean,  digits  are different, too. Right?	no
10905	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	It might also be potentially confusing.	no
10906	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah, but those are folded in, and it's just -	no
10907	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	you just mark the transcripts differently. So - so one option is you fold it in,	no
10908	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
10909	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and just simply in the file you mark somewhere that this is this type of	no
10910	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah, I th-	no
10911	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	interaction,  rather than  another  type of interaction.	no
10912	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, I don- I wouldn't call	no
10913	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	"reading digits ""meetings""."	no
10914	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right? I mean, we - we - we were doing -	no
10915	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, but -	no
10916	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	but,	no
10917	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	"I put it under the same directory tree. You know, it's in ""user doctor speech data M_R""."	no
10918	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well -	no
10919	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	"Can we just have a directory called, like, ""other stuff""?"	no
10920	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And -	no
10921	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Other.	no
10922	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well - or, I dunno.	no
10923	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I mean, I don't care what directory tree you have it under.  Right? I mean that's just a -	no
10924	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And -	no
10925	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and just,	no
10926	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um, store it there. I mean -	no
10927	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K. My preference	no
10928	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yes.	no
10929	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	is to have a single procedure so that I don't have to  think  too much about things.	no
10930	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And,	no
10931	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10932	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	just have a marking.	no
10933	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	If we do it any  other  way that means that we need a separate procedure,	no
10934	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_-	no
10935	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	You - you can use whatever procedure you want	no
10936	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and someone has to  do  that.	no
10937	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	that's p- convenient for you. All I'm saying is that there's no way that we're gonna tell people that reading digits is meetings.	no
10938	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
10939	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And similarly we're not gonna tell them that someone talking to a computer to get travel information is meetings.	no
10940	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Those aren't meetings.	no
10941	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But if it makes it easier for you to pu- fold them in the same procedures and have them under the same directory tree, knock yourself out. You know?	no
10942	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	There's a	no
10943	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	couple other questions that I have too, and -	no
10944	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and  one of  them   is, what about, uh,	no
10945	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	consent issues?	no
10946	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And the other one is, what about transcription?	no
10947	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Transcription is done in Munich.	no
10948	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Are - ?	no
10949	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K. So  we  don't have to worry about transcribing it?	no
10950	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10951	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Alright.	no
10952	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So, w- we will hafta worry about	no
10953	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	That's a - that's another argument to keep it separate, because it's gonna follow the SmartKom transcription conventions and not the	no
10954	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	format.	no
10955	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Oh, O_K.	no
10956	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10957	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	ICSI meeting transcription  conventions.	no
10958	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Ah.	no
10959	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K. Well, I didn't realize that. That's - that's a -	no
10960	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Good point.	no
10961	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Good point.	no
10962	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But I'm sure no one would have a problem with our folding it in for some acoustic modeling or - or some things.	no
10963	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Um.	no
10964	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Do we h- do we have, uh,	no
10965	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um,	no
10966	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	American-born folk, uh, reading German -	no
10967	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	German, uh, pla- uh,	no
10968	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	place names and so forth? Is that - ?	no
10969	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10970	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Exactly.	no
10971	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10972	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yep.	no
10973	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah, great.	no
10974	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10975	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	They - they even have a reading list. It's pretty funny.	no
10976	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I bet that sounds good, huh?	no
10977	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10978	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10979	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	You can do that if you want.	no
10980	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K.	no
10981	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10982	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I dunno if you want that.	no
10983	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10984	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
10985	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So -	no
10986	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Hmm.	no
10987	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Heidelberg	no
10988	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Exactly	no
10989	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Disk might eventually be an issue so we might -	no
10990	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Do you wanna be a subject?	yes
10991	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Disk might eventually be an issue so we might -	no
10992	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Do you wanna be a subject?	no
10993	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah, I be pretty good.	no
10994	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	we -	no
10995	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	we might need to, uh,	no
10996	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	get some more disk pretty soon. We're about -	no
10997	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	We -	no
10998	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
10999	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	That was one of our concerns.	no
11000	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
11001	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	we're about half -	no
11002	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	halfway through our disk right now.	no
11003	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Are we only half? I thought we were more than that.	no
11004	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	We're probably a little more than that because we're using up some space that we shouldn't be on.	no
11005	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So,	no
11006	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	once everything gets converted over to the disks we're  supposed  to be using we'll be probably,	no
11007	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh, seventy-five percent.	no
11008	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, when I was looking for space for Thilo, I found one disk that had,	no
11009	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh,	no
11010	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I think it was nine gigs and another one had seventeen.	no
11011	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yep.	no
11012	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And everything else was sorta committed.	no
11013	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Uh -	no
11014	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Were those	no
11015	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	backed-up or non-backed-up?	no
11016	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Those were  non-backed-up.	no
11017	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Non-back-up.	no
11018	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right. So that's different.	no
11019	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	S- oh, you're talking about backed-up.	no
11020	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I'm much more concerned about	no
11021	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the backed-up.	no
11022	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	@@	no
11023	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	The non-backed-up,  yeah, i-	no
11024	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I haven't looked to see how much of that we have.	no
11025	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	is cheap. I mean, if we need to we can	no
11026	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	buy a disk, hang it off a s- uh, workstation. If it's not backed-up the sysadmins don't care too much.	no
11027	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah. So, I mean,	no
11028	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	pretty much anytime we need a disk, we can get it at the rate that we're -	no
11029	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	You can -	no
11030	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I shouldn't be saying this, but,	no
11031	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	you can just -	no
11032	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	you know,	no
11033	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	since	no
11034	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the back-ups are every night,	no
11035	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	you can recycle the backed-up diskspace.	no
11036	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah. But that's - that's -  that's risky.	no
11037	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah. You really shouldn't be saying -	no
11038	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mmm. Mmm.  @@	no
11039	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I didn't say that. I didn't say that.	no
11040	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah, that's right. Beep that out.	no
11041	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Da- we had allowed Dave to listen to these -  these,	no
11042	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
11043	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh, recordings.  Um  -	no
11044	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah, I me- and	no
11045	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	there's been this	no
11046	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	conversation going on about getting another file server, and -	no
11047	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	no
11048	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and	no
11049	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	we  can   do that.	no
11050	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	We'll	no
11051	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	take the opportunity and get another big raft of -	no
11052	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
11053	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	of disk, I guess.	no
11054	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well,	no
11055	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	It's really the back-up issue rather than the file server issue.	no
11056	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I think -	no
11057	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I think there's an argument for having - you know, you could use our old file server for - for disks that have data that  is very	no
11058	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	rarely accessed, and then have a fast	no
11059	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	new file server	no
11060	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	for	no
11061	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	data that is, um,	no
11062	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
11063	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	heavily	no
11064	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	accessed.	no
11065	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	My understanding is, the issue isn't really the file server. We could  always  put more disks on. It's the back-up system.	no
11066	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
11067	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
11068	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	It's the back- it's the back-up capaci- Yeah.	no
11069	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So - which is near saturation,	no
11070	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	apparently.	no
11071	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So.	no
11072	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Soon.	no
11073	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I think - I think the file server  could  become an issue as	no
11074	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	we get	no
11075	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	a whole bunch more	no
11076	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	new compute machines. And we've got,	no
11077	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	you know,	no
11078	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	fifty	no
11079	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	machines trying to access	no
11080	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	data off of Abbott at once.	no
11081	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, we're alright for now because the network's so slow.	no
11082	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I mean, I think - I think we've raised this before and someone said this is not a reliable	no
11083	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	way to do it, but the -	no
11084	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	What about putting the stuff on,	no
11085	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	like, C_- C_D-ROM or D_V_D or something?	no
11086	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah. That was me.	no
11087	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I was the one who said it was not reliable. The- they -	no
11088	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K.	no
11089	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	they wear out.	no
11090	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Oh, O_K.	no
11091	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah. The - the - th-	no
11092	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But they wear out just from sitting on the shelf?	no
11093	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yep.	no
11094	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Absolutely.	no
11095	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Or from being   read   and  read?	no
11096	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	No.	no
11097	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Read and write don't hurt  them   too much unless you scratch  them.	no
11098	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Oh, O_K.	no
11099	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But the r-	no
11100	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the write once, and the read-writes, don't last.	no
11101	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So you don't wa- you don't wanna put ir-  un-	no
11102	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	reproduceable data  on them.	no
11103	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Uh-huh.	no
11104	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Wear out after what amount of time?	no
11105	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Year or two.	no
11106	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Would it be - ?	no
11107	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Year  or two?	no
11108	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yep.	no
11109	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Wow.	no
11110	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Hmm.	no
11111	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But if that -	no
11112	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	then you would	no
11113	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	think you'd  hear much more	no
11114	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	clamoring about	no
11115	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
11116	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	data loss and -	no
11117	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I mean, yeah, all the L_-	no
11118	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I - I don't know many people who do it on C_D.	no
11119	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I mean, they're - the most -	no
11120	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	L_D_C- all the L_D_C distributions are on C_D-ROM.	no
11121	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	fo-	no
11122	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
11123	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	They're on C_D, but they're not -	no
11124	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Like -	no
11125	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	tha- that's not the only source. They have  them   on disk.	no
11126	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And they burn new ones every once in a while. But if you go -	no
11127	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But, you know, we have -	no
11128	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But we have like thirty  you know, from  ten years ago? No.	no
11129	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	if you go k-	no
11130	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	We have all sorts of C_D-ROMs from a long time ago.	no
11131	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah! Ten years ago. Ninety-one, and they're still all fine.	no
11132	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
11133	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
11134	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, th-	no
11135	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	th-	no
11136	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Were they burned or were they pressed?	no
11137	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
11138	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Uh, both. I've burned them and they're still O_K. I mean,  usually  they're -	no
11139	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
11140	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K. The - the  pressed  ones last for- well, not forever, they've been finding even those degrade.	no
11141	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Oh, I see.	no
11142	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But, uh,	no
11143	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the  burned  ones - I mean,	no
11144	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	when I say two or three years what I'm saying is that	no
11145	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	That's what I -	no
11146	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I have had disks which are  gone  in a year.	no
11147	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	On the  average,  it'll probably be three or  four  years.	no
11148	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But, uh - I - I - you don't want to per-	no
11149	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	p- have your only copy on a media that	no
11150	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	fails.	no
11151	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mmm.	no
11152	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And they do.	no
11153	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So how  about   - ?	no
11154	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Um,	no
11155	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	if you have  them   professionally  pressed,	no
11156	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	y- you know, they're good for decades.	no
11157	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So -	no
11158	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	so how about putting them on that	no
11159	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	plus,	no
11160	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	like on a - on -	no
11161	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	on DAT or some other	no
11162	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	medium that isn't	no
11163	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I think th- um,	no
11164	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	risky ?	no
11165	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	we can already put them on tape.	no
11166	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K.	no
11167	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And the tape is hi- is  very  reliable.	no
11168	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	no
11169	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So the - the only issue is then  if we need access to them.	no
11170	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
11171	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So that's fine f- if we don't need access to  them.	no
11172	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, if - if - if you - if they last -	no
11173	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Say, they actually last, like, five years, huh,	no
11174	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	in - in the typical case,	no
11175	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and -	no
11176	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and occasionally you might need to recreate one,	no
11177	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and then you get your tape out, but otherwise you don't.	no
11178	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Can't you just - you just put them on - ?	no
11179	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So you just archive it on the	no
11180	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	tape, and then	no
11181	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
11182	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	put it on C_D as well?	no
11183	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
11184	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Oh. So you're just saying put  them   on C_Ds	no
11185	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	for normal access.	no
11186	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
11187	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
11188	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
11189	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I mean, you can do that but that's pretty annoying, because the C_Ds are so slow.	no
11190	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	What you -	no
11191	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	See -	no
11192	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
11193	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mmm.	no
11194	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
11195	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	What'd be nice is a system that re-burned the C_Ds every	no
11196	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	year.	no
11197	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	"H- everytime it was a ""gonna"" - ""gonna die""."	no
11198	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
11199	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, I mean, the C_Ds are -	no
11200	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well -	no
11201	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	It's like - like dynamic ra- D_RAM.	no
11202	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	are	no
11203	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	an op-	no
11204	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Just before.	no
11205	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Just before they- be- before it goes bad, it burns them in.	no
11206	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
11207	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	The -	no
11208	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the C_D is an  alternative  to tape. ICSI already has a perfectly good tape system and it's more reliable.	no
11209	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
11210	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	You know -	no
11211	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So for archiving, we'll just use tape.	no
11212	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	One - one thing I don't understand is, if you have the data -	no
11213	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I  would think -	no
11214	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	if - if you- if the meeting data	no
11215	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	is put on disk exactly once,	no
11216	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	then it's backed-up once and the back-up system should never have to	no
11217	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well,	no
11218	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	bother with it,  uh,   more than once.	no
11219	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	regardless - Well, first of all there was,	no
11220	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um, a problem with the	no
11221	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	archive in that I was every once in a while doing a chmod on all the directories an- or recursive chmod and chown, because	no
11222	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	no
11223	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	they weren't getting  set  correctly every once in a while, and I was just,	no
11224	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	doing a	no
11225	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	minus R_ star,	no
11226	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	no
11227	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	not realizing that that	no
11228	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Ah.	no
11229	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	caused  it to be re-backed-up.	no
11230	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But  normally  you're correct.	no
11231	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But even without that, the back-up system is becoming saturated.	no
11232	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But - but this back-up system is smart enough to figure out that something hasn't changed and doesn't need to be  backed-up again.	no
11233	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Sure, but we still have enough changed	no
11234	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	The b-	no
11235	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	that the nightly back-ups are starting to take too long.	no
11236	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I think th- the - at least the once tha- that you put it on, it would -	no
11237	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	it would	no
11238	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K. So - so then, if - So - so then, let's - Right.	no
11239	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	It has nothing to do with the meeting. It's just the general ICSI back-up system is becoming saturated.	no
11240	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	kill that. So.	no
11241	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K.	no
11242	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
11243	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So, what if we buy,	no
11244	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh -	no
11245	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh, what - what do they call these, um  high density - ?	no
11246	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, why don't you have this -	no
11247	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	have a -	no
11248	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	this conversation with Dave Johnson tha- rather than with me?	no
11249	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	No, no. Because this is  maybe something that we can do without involving Dave, and -	no
11250	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and,	no
11251	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	putting more burden on him.	no
11252	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	How  about   we buy,	no
11253	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh - uh - uh, one of these high density tape drives?	no
11254	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And we put the data actually on non-backed-up	no
11255	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	disks.	no
11256	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And we do our own back-up once and for  all   - all, and then - and we don't have to bother this  @@  up?	no
11257	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Actually, you know, we could do that just with the tape - with the current tape.	no
11258	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I dunno what the- these tapes - uh, at some point these -	no
11259	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I dunno. What kind of tape drive is it? Is it - is - ?	no
11260	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I dunno but it's an automatic robot so it's very convenient.	no
11261	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Wh-	no
11262	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
11263	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	You just run a program to restore them.	no
11264	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	The o-	no
11265	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the one that we have?	no
11266	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
11267	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But it might interfere with their back-up schedule, eh.	no
11268	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	The - I mean -	no
11269	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But -	no
11270	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	No, we have s- we - Don't we have our own? Something wi- th- that doesn't -	no
11271	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	that isn't used by the back-up gang?	no
11272	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Don't we have something	no
11273	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well they -	no
11274	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	downstairs?	no
11275	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	What   kinda tape drive?	no
11276	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Just in - ?	no
11277	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well -	no
11278	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
11279	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	but - no, but Andreas's point is a good one. And we don't  have  to do anything  ourselves  to do that. They're already right now on tape.	no
11280	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
11281	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right. So your - your  point  is, and I think it's a  good  one, that we could just get more disk and put it there.	no
11282	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mmm.	no
11283	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	On an X_H - uh, X_ - X_ whatever partition.  Yeah.	no
11284	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
11285	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	That's not a bad idea.	no
11286	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah, that's basically what I was gonna say, is that a disk is - is so cheap it's es- essentially, you know, close to free.	no
11287	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So once it's on tape -	no
11288	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
11289	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And the only thing that costs is the back-up  issue,	no
11290	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
11291	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	eh, to first order. And we can take care of that by putting it on non-back-  up drives and just	no
11292	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	no
11293	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	backing it up once onto this tape.	no
11294	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I think that's a good idea.	no
11295	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
11296	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Oh.   Yeah.	no
11297	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K.	no
11298	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Good.	no
11299	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	It's good.	no
11300	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So,	no
11301	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	who's gonna do these back-ups? The people that collect it?	no
11302	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Uh	no
11303	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, I'll talk to Dave,	no
11304	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and - and see what th- how -	no
11305	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	what the best way of doing that is.	no
11306	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	It's probably gonna n-	no
11307	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	There's a little utility	no
11308	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	that	no
11309	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	will manually burn a tape for you, and that's probably the right way to do it.	no
11310	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah, and we should probably make that part of the procedure for recording the meetings.	no
11311	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, s-	no
11312	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yep.	no
11313	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah. That's what I'm wondering, if -	no
11314	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well  we're g- we're gonna automate that. My intention is to  do a script that'll do everything.	no
11315	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K.	no
11316	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I mean, you don't have to physically	no
11317	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	put a tape in the drive? Or s- ?	no
11318	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	No.	no
11319	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Oh, O_K.	no
11320	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	It's all tape robot, so you just sit down at your computer and you type a command.	no
11321	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So it's just -	no
11322	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Oh, O_K.	no
11323	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah, but then you're effectively using the resources of the back-up system.	no
11324	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Or is that a different tape robot?	no
11325	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But not at the same time.	no
11326	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah. But y- but you would be anyway.	no
11327	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	No, no. See -	no
11328	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right? Because -	no
11329	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	No, no, no.  He's  saying get a  whole  different drive.	no
11330	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah, just give a dedi-	no
11331	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But there's no reason to do that.	no
11332	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, I'm saying is  @@	no
11333	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	It - we already have it there and it - it's -	no

11356	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And then	no
11357	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	you can tell it to then remove it from the disk or you can, you know, do it a-	no

11366	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And if you did that during the day it would never make it to the nightly back-ups.	no
11367	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
11368	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And then there wouldn't be this extra load.	no
11369	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, it - if he - you have to put the data on a - on a non-backed-up disk to begin with.	no

11371	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no

11383	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
11384	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
11385	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So, I think that's a good idea.	no
11386	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K.	no
11387	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	That's what we should do.	no
11388	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K.	no
11389	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So, that means we'll probably wanna convert all -	no
11390	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	all those files -	no
11391	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	filesystems to non-backed-up media.	no

11406	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	well,	no
11407	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	we have lots of them.	no

11414	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	That's good.	no
11415	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Oh.	no
11416	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mmm.	no
11417	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Lift the Herve approach.	no
11418	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
11419	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So, I mean I'm just playing with, um,	no
11420	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the number of Gaussians that we use in the - the recognizer, and -	no
11421	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, you have to sa- you have to  tell people that you're - you're doing - you're trying the  tandem  features.	no
11422	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yes, I'm using tandem features.	no
11423	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Oh you are? Cool.	no
11424	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	A- and I'm still	no
11425	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And -	no
11426	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	@@	no
11427	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	tinkering with the P_L_P features.	no
11428	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah, I got confused by the results. It sai- because - uh, the  meeting before,	no
11429	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	"you said ""O_K, we got it down to where they're - they're within a tenth of a percent""."	no
11430	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	That was on  males.	no
11431	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
11432	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	That was - that was before I tried it on the females.	no
11433	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Oh.	no
11434	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	See, women are nothi- are,	no
11435	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	It's the  women  are the problem. O_K.	no
11436	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	trouble. Right? As we all know. So.	no
11437	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, let's just say that men are simple.	no
11438	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So -	no
11439	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	so, when -	no
11440	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So I - I had -	no
11441	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	That was a quick response.	no
11442	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I ha-	no
11443	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So, we had reached the point where -	no
11444	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I'm well rehearsed.	no
11445	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
11446	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	we had reached the point where,	no
11447	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um,	no
11448	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	on the male portion of the  development set,	no
11449	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the,	no
11450	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um -	no
11451	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	or one of the development sets, I should say -	no
11452	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the, um -	no
11453	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the male error rate with, uh, ICSI P_L_P features	no
11454	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	was	no
11455	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	pretty much identical	no
11456	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	with, uh, S_R_I	no
11457	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	features.	no
11458	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	which are  M_F_C_C. So,	no
11459	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um,	no
11460	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	"then I thought, ""Oh, great."	no
11461	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I'll j- I'll -	no
11462	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	"just let's make sure everything works on the females."" And"	no
11463	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the error rate -	no
11464	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Oh.	no
11465	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	you know, there was a three percent difference.	no
11466	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Uh-huh.	no
11467	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So,	no
11468	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Is there less training data?	no
11469	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh -	no
11470	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	No, actually there's more training data.	no
11471	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I mean, we don-	no
11472	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	This is on just digits?	no
11473	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	No, no.	no
11474	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Oh, sorry. O_K. This is on - Oh, O_K.	no
11475	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	No.	no
11476	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	No. It's, uh, Swi-	no
11477	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Hub-five.	no
11478	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	This is Hub-five.	no
11479	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Hub-five. Yeah.	no
11480	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
11481	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Um, and the test data is CallHome and Switchboard.	no
11482	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So,	no
11483	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh - so then  um -	no
11484	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Oh, and plus the -	no
11485	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the vocal tract  length normalization	no
11486	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	didn't -	no
11487	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	actually made things  worse.	no
11488	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So something's really seriously wrong. So -	no
11489	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Um -	no
11490	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Aha!	no
11491	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Hhh.	no
11492	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So -	no
11493	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K.	no
11494	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So -	no
11495	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So - but you see, now, between - between the males	no
11496	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and the females, there's certainly a much bigger	no
11497	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	difference in the scaling	no
11498	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	range,	no
11499	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	than there is, say, just within the males.	no
11500	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And what you were using before was scaling factors that were just from the - the m- the  S_R_I front-end.	no
11501	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And that worked - that worked fine.	no
11502	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	That's true.	no
11503	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
11504	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Uh,	no
11505	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	but now you're looking over a larger range and it may not be so fine.	no
11506	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, um -	no
11507	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So -	no
11508	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I just -	no
11509	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	d- so the one thing that I then tried was to	no
11510	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	put in the low-pass filter,	no
11511	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	which we have in the -	no
11512	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So, most -	no
11513	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	most	no
11514	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Hub-five systems actually	no
11515	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	band-limit the -	no
11516	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh, at about,	no
11517	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh, thirty-seven hundred,	no
11518	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Uh-huh.	no
11519	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um,	no
11520	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	hertz.	no
11521	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Although, you know, normally, I mean, the channel goes to	no
11522	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	four -	no
11523	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	four thousand. Right? So,	no
11524	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um -	no
11525	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And that actually helped,	no
11526	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh -	no
11527	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Uh-huh.	no
11528	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh,	no
11529	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	a little bit.	no
11530	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Um  and it didn't hurt on the males either. So,	no
11531	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um -	no
11532	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And I'm now,	no
11533	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh,	no
11534	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	trying	no
11535	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the -	no
11536	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Oh, and suddenly, also the v- the vocal tract length normalization only in the  test  se- on the  test  data.	no
11537	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So, you can do vocal tract length normalization	no
11538	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
11539	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	on the test data only or on both the training and the test.	no
11540	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And	no
11541	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	you expect it to help a  little  bit if you do it only on the  test,  and s- more if you do it on both training and test.	no
11542	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
11543	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And	no
11544	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	so the -	no
11545	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	It now helps,	no
11546	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	if you do it only on the test, and	no
11547	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I'm currently retraining  another  set of models where it's both in the training and the test, and then	no
11548	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	we'll -	no
11549	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	we'll have,	no
11550	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	hopefully, even better results. So -	no
11551	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But there's -	no
11552	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	It looks like there will still be some difference,	no
11553	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	maybe	no
11554	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	between one and two percent,	no
11555	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um,	no
11556	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Huh.	no
11557	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	for the females. And so,	no
11558	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um,	no
11559	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	you know, I'm open to suggestions.	no
11560	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And it  is  true that the, uh - that the -	no
11561	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	no
11562	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	you know, we  are  using the -	no
11563	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But -	no
11564	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	it  can't  be just the	no
11565	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	V_T_L,	no
11566	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Uh-huh.	no
11567	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	because	no
11568	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	if you  don't  do V_T_L in both systems,	no
11569	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	No - no. I - I  remember   that.	no
11570	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	It's much worse.	no
11571	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh, you know, the -	no
11572	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
11573	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the females are considerably worse	no
11574	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	in the -	no
11575	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	with the P_L_P features.	no
11576	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So there must be some -	no
11577	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	something else going on.	no
11578	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, what's the standard - ?	no
11579	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah,   so I thought the performance was actually a little  better  on females than males.	no
11580	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	That's what I thought, too.	no
11581	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Um,	no
11582	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	that  ye-  overall, yes, but on this particular development test set,	no
11583	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	they're actually a little worse.	no
11584	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But that's beside the point. We're looking at the discrepancy between	no
11585	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the S_R_I	no
11586	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	system and the	no
11587	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	S_R_I system when trained with ICSI features.	no
11588	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right. I'm just wondering if that -	no
11589	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	What's - Are the freq- ?	no
11590	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	if - if you have any indication of your standard features, you know, if that's also different  or in the same direction or not.	no
11591	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	You're -	no
11592	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	This is - lemme ask a q-	no
11593	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Cuz -	no
11594	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	more basic que- I mean, is this, uh - uh,	no
11595	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	no
11596	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	iterative,	no
11597	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Baum-Welch training? Or is it Viterbi training? Or - ?	no
11598	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	It's Baum-Welch training.	no
11599	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Baum-Welch training.	no
11600	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And how do you determine when to - to stop iterating?	no
11601	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Um -	no
11602	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, actually,	no
11603	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	we - we just basically do a s-	no
11604	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	a fixed number of iterations.	no
11605	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Hmm.	no
11606	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Uh, in this case four.	no
11607	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Um,	no
11608	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	which -	no
11609	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Eh, we used to do only three, and then we	no
11610	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	found out we can squeeze -	no
11611	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And it was	no
11612	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	basically,	no
11613	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	we're s- we're keeping it on the safe side. But you're d- Right. It might be that one more iteration	no
11614	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	would - would help, but it's sort of  you know.	no
11615	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Or maybe - or maybe you're doing one too  many.  I mean it's - it's -	no
11616	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	No, but with Baum-Welch,	no
11617	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	there shouldn't be an over-fitting issue, really.	no
11618	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	@@	no
11619	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Uh.  Well, there can be. Sure.	no
11620	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Um.	no
11621	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, you can try each one on a cross-validation set, can't you?	no
11622	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	It d- if you - if you remember some years ago Bill Byrne did a thing where he was - he was looking at that, and he showed that you  could  get it. So.	no
11623	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
11624	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But -	no
11625	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, yeah. We can -	no
11626	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	but -	no
11627	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	but, um -	no
11628	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, that's - that's the easy one to check, because	no
11629	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
11630	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Do you - ?	no
11631	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	we save all the intermediate models and we can -	no
11632	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And in each case, ho-	no
11633	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	What - ?	no
11634	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um, I'm sorry - in each case how do you determine,	no
11635	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	you know, the - the usual  fudge factors? The, uh -	no
11636	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the, uh, language, uh, scaling, acoustic scaling, uh,	no
11637	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Um  I uh -	no
11638	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh -	no
11639	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I'm actually re-optimizing them.	no
11640	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Although that hasn't shown to make  a big difference.	no
11641	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K. And the pru- the question he was asking at one point about pruning,	no
11642	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh -	no
11643	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Pruning - ?	no
11644	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Remember that one?	no
11645	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Pruning in the - ?	no
11646	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, he was - he's - it looked like the probabil- at one point he was looking at the probabilities he was getting out - at the likelihoods he was getting out of P_L_P versus mel cepstrum, and they looked pretty different,	no
11647	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah, the likelihoods were  lower	no
11648	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	as I recall.	no
11649	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Oh.	no
11650	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And so, uh, there's the question -	no
11651	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	for the P_L_P.	no
11652	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I- you mean -	no
11653	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	did you see this in the S_R_I system?	no
11654	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	no
11655	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Um.	no
11656	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Was just looking through the log files, and -	no
11657	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, the likelihoods are -	no
11658	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	You can't directly compare them,	no
11659	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	because, for every set of models you compute a new normalization.	no
11660	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And so these	no
11661	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	log probabilities, they aren't	no
11662	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	directly  comparable   because you have a different normalization constants for each model you train. So -	no
11663	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Oh.	no
11664	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Hmm.	no
11665	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But, still it's a question - if you have some threshold somewhere in terms of beam search or something, or - ?	no
11666	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, yeah. That's what I was wondering.	no
11667	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	W- yeah. I mean -	no
11668	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Uh -	no
11669	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I mean, if you have one threshold that works well	no
11670	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	because	no
11671	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the range of your likelihoods is in	no
11672	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	this area -	no
11673	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	We prune very conservatively. I mean,	no
11674	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	as we saw with the meeting data,	no
11675	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um  we could probably	no
11676	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	tighten the pruning without really -	no
11677	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So we- we basically we have a very open beam.	no
11678	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But, you're only talking about a percent or two. Right? Here we're- we're saying that we- there - gee, there's this b- eh, there's this difference here.	no
11679	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
11680	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And  it -	no
11681	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	See cuz, i- i-	no
11682	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	there could be lots of things. Right? But - but - but - but,	no
11683	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
11684	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Course.	no
11685	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um,	no
11686	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	let's suppose just for a second that, uh, we've sort of	no
11687	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	taken out a lot of the - the major differences, uh, between the two. I mean, we're already sort of using the mel scale and we're using the same style filter integration, and	no
11688	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	no
11689	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
11690	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and, well, we're making sure that low and high -	no
11691	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Actually, there is - the difference in that. So, for the P_L_P features we use the triangular	no
11692	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	filter shapes. And for the -	no
11693	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	in the S_R_I front-end we use the trapezoidal one.	no
11694	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And what's the top frequency of each?	no
11695	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, now it's the same.	no
11696	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	It's thirty -	no
11697	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	thirty to seven hundred and sixty hertz.	no
11698	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah. Exp- one's triangular, one's trapezoidal. So -	no
11699	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	No, no. But -	no
11700	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Before we - i- i- th- with straight P_L_P, it's trapezoidal also. But then we had a slight difference in the - in the scale.	no
11701	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well -	no
11702	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But -	no
11703	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Uh, so.	no
11704	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Since	no
11705	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	currently the Feacalc program doesn't allow me to change  the filter shape independently of the scale.	no
11706	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Uh-huh.	no
11707	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And,	no
11708	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I did the experiment on the  S_R_I  front-end where I tried the -	no
11709	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	y- where the standard used to be	no
11710	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	to use trapezoidal filters.	no
11711	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	You can actually continuously vary it between the two. And so I	no
11712	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	wen-	no
11713	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I swi- I tried the trap- eh, triangular ones.	no
11714	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And it did  slightly  worse, but it's really a small difference.	no
11715	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Hmm.	no
11716	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So -	no
11717	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Coup-	no
11718	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Couple tenths of a percent or something.  Right.	no
11719	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K. So it's  not  just	no
11720	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah, exactly. So, it's not - I don't think the filter shape by itself will make	no
11721	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	losing some	no
11722	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	frequency range.	no
11723	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
11724	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	a huge	no
11725	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right. So the oth-	no
11726	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	difference.	no
11727	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
11728	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the other	no
11729	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	thing that - So, f-	no
11730	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	i-	no
11731	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	We've always viewed it, anyway, as the  major  difference between the two,	no
11732	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	is actually in the smoothing,	no
11733	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	no
11734	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	that the - that the, um,	no
11735	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	P_L_P, and -	no
11736	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and the reason P_L_P has been	no
11737	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	advantageous in, uh, slightly noisy situations is because,	no
11738	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	no
11739	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	P_L_P does the smoothing at the end by an auto-regressive model,	no
11740	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and mel cepstrum does it by just computing the lower	no
11741	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	cepstral coefficients.	no
11742	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	no
11743	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Um.	no
11744	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So,	no
11745	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um -	no
11746	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K. So  one thing I haven't done yet is to actually do all of this with	no
11747	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	a much larger -	no
11748	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	with our full training set.	no
11749	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So right now, we're using a -	no
11750	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I don't know, forty?	no
11751	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I- i- it's - it's -  eh	no
11752	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	it's a f- training set that's about,	no
11753	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um,	no
11754	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	you know, by a factor of four smaller than what we use when we train the full system. So,	no
11755	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	no
11756	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	some of these smoothing issues are over-fitting for that matter. And the Baum-Welch	no
11757	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	no
11758	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	should	no
11759	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	be much less of a factor, if you go	no
11760	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	full -	no
11761	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Could be. Yeah.	no
11762	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	whole hog. And so,	no
11763	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	w- so, just um -	no
11764	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	so the strategy is to first sort of treat things  with fast turn-around on a smaller training set and then,	no
11765	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	when you've sort of,	no
11766	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	narrowed it down, you try it on a	no
11767	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
11768	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	larger training set. And so, we haven't done that yet.	no
11769	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Now the other que- related question, though, is - is,	no
11770	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh, what's the boot models	no
11771	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	for these things?	no
11772	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Th- th- the boot models  are  trained from scratch. So we compute, um -	no
11773	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So, we start with a,	no
11774	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um,	no
11775	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	alil- alignment	no
11776	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	that we computed with the b- sort of the best system we have.	no
11777	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And -	no
11778	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and then we train from scratch. So we com- we do a,	no
11779	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	you know, w- um -	no
11780	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	We collect the -	no
11781	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh,	no
11782	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the observations	no
11783	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	from those alignments under each of the feature	no
11784	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	sets that - that we  train.	no
11785	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And then,	no
11786	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	from there we do,	no
11787	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um -	no
11788	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	There's a lot of, actually -	no
11789	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	The way it works, you first train a phonetically-tied	no
11790	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	mixture model.	no
11791	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Um.	no
11792	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	You do a total of -	no
11793	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	First you do a context-independent	no
11794	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	P_T_M model. Then you switch to a context -	no
11795	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	You do two iterations of that.	no
11796	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Then you do two iterations of - of - of context- dependent	no
11797	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	phonetically-tied mixtures.	no
11798	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And then from that you - you do the -	no
11799	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	you - you go to a state-clustered model,	no
11800	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
11801	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and you do four iterations of that. So there's a  lot  of iterations overall between your	no
11802	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	original boot models and the final models. I don't think that -	no
11803	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Hmm.	no
11804	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	We have never seen big	no
11805	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	"differences. Once I thought ""oh, I can -"	no
11806	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	"Now I have these  much  better models. I'll re-generate my initial alignments. Then I'll get much better models at the end."""	no
11807	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Made no difference whatsoever. It's -	no
11808	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
11809	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I think it's - eh, i-	no
11810	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the boot models are  recur-	no
11811	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well, mis- for making things  better.  Yeah. But,	no
11812	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	this for making things  worse.  This it migh-  Th- the thought is - is - is  possible  - another possible  partial cause is if the boot models	no
11813	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	no
11814	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	used a comple- used a different feature set,	no
11815	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	no
11816	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	that -	no
11817	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But there  are  no boot models, in fact.	no
11818	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	You - you're not booting from initial models. You're booting from initial alignments.	no
11819	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Which you got from a different feature set.	no
11820	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	@@	no
11821	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	That's correct.	no
11822	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So, those features  look  at the data differently, actually.	no
11823	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah, but -	no
11824	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I mean, you know, they - they will find boundaries a little differently, though - You know, all th- all that sort of thing is actually slightly different.	no
11825	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I'd expect it to be a minor effect, but -	no
11826	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But - but - but, what I'm - what I'm saying is -	no
11827	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So,	no
11828	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	we e-	no
11829	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	w- f- w-	no
11830	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	For a long time we had used boot alignments	no
11831	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	that	no
11832	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	had been trained with a -	no
11833	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	with the same  front-end  but with acoustic models that were,	no
11834	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	like, fifteen percent worse than what we use now.	no
11835	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	no
11836	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And with a dict- different dictionary - with a  considerably  different dictionary, which was much less detailed and much less well-suited.	no
11837	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	no
11838	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
11839	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And so,	no
11840	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	then we switched to new boot alignments, which - which now had the benefit of all these	no
11841	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	improvements that we've made over two years in the system.	no
11842	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
11843	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And,	no
11844	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the result in the end was no different.	no
11845	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
11846	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So, what I'm saying is, the exact nature of these boot alignments is	no
11847	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	probably not  a big factor in the quality of the final models.	no
11848	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah, maybe not.	no
11849	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But  it - it - I st- still see it as - I mean,	no
11850	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
11851	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	there's - there's a history to this, too, but I - uh, I don't wanna go into, but -	no
11852	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	no
11853	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	but I - I - I th- I think it  could  be	no
11854	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
11855	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the things  that it -	no
11856	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the  data  is being viewed in a certain way,	no
11857	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
11858	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh, that	no
11859	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	a beginning	no
11860	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	is  here  rather than  there  and so forth, because the actual signal-processing you're doing is slightly different.	no
11861	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
11862	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But,	no
11863	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
11864	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	it's - it's - that's probably not it.	no
11865	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Anyway, I - I - I should really reserve,	no
11866	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh,	no
11867	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	any conclusions until we've done it on the	no
11868	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	large training set,	no
11869	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um, and until we've seen the results with the - with the V_T_L in training.	no
11870	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So.	no
11871	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah. At  some  point you also might wanna  take  the same thing and try it on,	no
11872	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
11873	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh, some Broadcast News data or something else that actually has - has some noisy -	no
11874	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	noisy components, so we can see	no
11875	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	if any conclusions we come to holds	no
11876	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	across  different data.	no
11877	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Right.	no
11878	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Uh -	no
11879	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And, uh, with  this,  I have to leave.	no
11880	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Hmm!	no
11881	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K.	no
11882	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	With this said.	no
11883	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So, is there something quick about Absinthe  that you - ?	no
11884	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Uh. Just what we were talking about before, which is that I	no
11885	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	ported a  Blass  library to Absinthe,	no
11886	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and then got -	no
11887	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	got it working with fast-forward,	no
11888	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and got	no
11889	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Oh.	no
11890	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	a speedup roughly proportional to the number of processors times the clock cycle. So, that's pretty good.	no
11891	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Oh!	no
11892	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Cool.	no
11893	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Um, I'm in the process of doing it for Quicknet, but there's something going wrong and it's about half the speed that	no
11894	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I was estimating it  should  be, and I'm not sure why.	no
11895	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	no
11896	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But I'll keep working on it. But the -	no
11897	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	what it means is that it's likely that for net training and forward passes,	no
11898	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	we'll -	no
11899	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Absinthe will be a good machine.	no
11900	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Especially if we get a few more processors and upgrade the processors.	no
11901	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	A few more processors? How many are you shooting for?	no
11902	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	There're five now. It can hold eight.	no
11903	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Oh, O_K.	no
11904	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah, we'll just go buy  them,    I guess .	no
11905	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And it's also five-fifty megahertz and you can get a  gigahertz.	no
11906	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
11907	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So.	no
11908	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Can you mix  t- uh, processors of different	no
11909	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I  don't  think so. I think we'd have to do all -	no
11910	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	speed?	no
11911	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K.	no
11912	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Probably just throw away the old ones, and -	no
11913	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yep.	no
11914	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Thank you  for the box, and -	no
11915	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Oh, O_K.	no
11916	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I'll just go buy their process.	no
11917	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Hmm!	no
11918	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Maybe we can stick them in another system. I dunno.	no
11919	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	We'd have to get a -	no
11920	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	almost certainly have to get a, uh, Netfinity server.	no
11921	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I see.	no
11922	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	They're	no
11923	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	pretty -	no
11924	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	pretty specialized.	no
11925	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
11926	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K.	no
11927	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K.	no
11928	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Is - is Liz coming back, do you know, or - ?	no
11929	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I don't know.	no
11930	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I dunno.	no
11931	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah. Oh, you don't. O_K.	no
11932	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Uh, I - I will.	no
11933	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Alright.	no
11934	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I - I actually have to run this stuff.	no
11935	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Alright.	no
11936	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K.	yes
11937	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K.	no
11938	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	See you.	no
11939	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Um.	no
11940	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Alright. So -	no
11941	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Uh, they're having tea out there. So I guess the other thing that we were gonna talk about is - is, uh, demo.	no
11942	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And, um, so, these are the demos for the  uh, July,	no
11943	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh, meeting  and,	no
11944	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	um -	no
11945	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	July what?	no
11946	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	DARPA mee-	no
11947	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Early July? Late July?	no
11948	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Oh, I think it's July fifteenth. Is that it?	no
11949	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Sixteen to eighteen, I think.	no
11950	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah, sixteenth, eighteenth.	no
11951	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Roughly.	no
11952	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah. So, we talked about getting something together for that, but maybe, uh -	no
11953	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	maybe we'll just put that off for now, given that -	no
11954	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	But I think maybe we should have a -	no
11955	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	a sub-meeting,	no
11956	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I think,	no
11957	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh,	no
11958	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	probably, uh,	no
11959	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Adam and -	no
11960	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and, uh, Chuck and me	no
11961	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	should talk about -	no
11962	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	should get together and talk about that sometime soon.	no
11963	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Over a cappuccino tomorrow?	no
11964	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah  something like that. Um,	no
11965	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh, you know, maybe -	no
11966	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	maybe we'll involve Dan Ellis at some -	no
11967	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Mm-hmm.	no
11968	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	some level as well.	no
11969	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Um.	no
11970	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K. The -	no
11971	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the tea is - is going, so, uh, I suggest we do, uh -	no
11972	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	uh, a unison.	no
11973	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	A unison digits?	yes
11974	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	A unison digits?	no
11975	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K.	no
11976	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Yeah.	no
11977	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Which is gonna be a little hard for a couple people because we have different digits forms.	no
11978	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Gets  our  -	no
11979	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Oops.	no
11980	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	We have a -	no
11981	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I found a couple of old ones.	no
11982	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Hmm.	no
11983	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Oh.	no
11984	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Well,	no
11985	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	that'll be interesting. So, uh -	no
11986	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Have you done digits before?	no
11987	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	No.	no
11988	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	I haven't done it.	no
11989	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K. So, uh,	no
11990	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	the idea is just to read each line  with a short pause	no
11991	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Alright.	no
11992	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	between lines, not between -	no
11993	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	And, uh, since we're in a hurry, we were just gonna read everyone all at once. So, if you sorta plug your ears and read -	no
11994	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K.	no
11995	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	So first read the transcript number,	no
11996	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	and then start reading the  digits.	no
11997	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	Sure.	no
11998	transcript	transcript_Bmr024	O_K?	no

12108	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Um.	no
12109	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So.	no
12110	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Agenda is - according to this, is transcription status, DARPA demos	yes

12116	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K.	no
12117	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Should we just go in order? Transcription status? Who's - that's probably you.	no
12118	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I can do that quickly. Um I hired several more transcribers, They're making great progress. Seve-  several,   several.	no
12119	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Seven?	no
12120	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Oh.	no
12121	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	And uh -	no
12122	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	and uh,	no
12123	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	uh I've been uh finishing up the uh double checking.	no
12124	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I hoped to have had that done by today but it's gonna take one more week.	no
12125	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Um	no
12126	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I g-	no
12127	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	as a  somewhat  segue into the next topic, um	no
12128	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	could I get a hold of uh	no
12129	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	the data even if it's not really corrected yet just so I can get the data formats	no
12130	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	and make sure the information retrieval stuff is working?	no
12131	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Certainly. Yeah I mean, it's in the same place it's been.	no
12132	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So can you just -	no
12133	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	"Oh,  it  is.  O_K. Just - So, ""transcripts"""	no
12134	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Uh-huh. No change.	no
12135	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Uh -	no
12136	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	is the sub-directory?	no
12137	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yes. Uh-huh.	no
12138	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K.	no
12139	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So I'll - I'll probably just make some copies of those rather than use the ones that are there.	no
12140	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K.	no
12141	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Um and then	no
12142	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	just - we'll have to remember to	no
12143	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	delete them once the corrections are made.	no
12144	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K.	no
12145	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K, wh-	no
12146	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I also got anot- a short remark to the transcription. I've uh just processed the first five E_D_U meetings and they are chunked up so they would - they probably can be sent to I_B_M	no
12147	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	whenever they want them.	no
12148	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Well the second one of those	no
12149	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Cool.	no
12150	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yep. It's already at I_B_M, but the other ones - Yeah.	no
12151	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	is already at I_B_M.	no
12152	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	That's the one that  we're waiting to hear from them on.	no
12153	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
12154	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
12155	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K.	no
12156	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	These are  separate  from the ones that - I mean, these are -	no
12157	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	As soon as -	no
12158	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	They're the I_B_M set.	no
12159	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	It's  this  one.	no
12160	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yep.	no
12161	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Excellent. Good.	no
12162	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
12163	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Is my mike on? Yeah.	no
12164	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	And so as soon as we hear	no
12165	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	from Brian	no
12166	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	that	no
12167	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	this one is O_K and we get the transcript back and we find out that	no
12168	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	hopefully there are no problems matching up the transcript	no
12169	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	with what we  gave	no
12170	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	them,	no
12171	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	then uh we'll be ready to go and we'll just send them the next four as a big batch,	no
12172	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Excellent.	no
12173	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	and let them work on that.	no
12174	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	And so we're doing those as disjoint from the ones we're transcribing here?	no
12175	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yes, exactly. We're sort of doing things in parallel, that way we can get as much done a- at once. Yeah.	no
12176	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K, good.	no
12177	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah, I think that's the right way to do it, especially for the information retrieval stuff.	no
12178	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Anything else on transcription status?	no
12179	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Hm-mmm.	no
12180	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K.	no
12181	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	DARPA demos, we had the submeeting the other day.	yes
12182	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	DARPA demos, we had the submeeting the other day.	no
12183	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Right, which uh -	no
12184	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So I've been working on using the THISL tools to do information retrieval on meeting data	no
12185	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	and the THISL tools are -	no
12186	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	there're two sets, there's a back-end and a front-end, so the front-end is the user interface and the back-end is the indexing tool and the querying tool.	no
12187	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	And so I've written some tools to convert everything into the right for- file formats.	no
12188	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	And the	no
12189	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	command line version of the indexing and the querying is now working.	no
12190	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So at least on the  one  meeting that I had the  transcript  for	no
12191	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	uh  conveniently  you can now do information retrieval on it, do - type in a - a string and get back a list of start-end times for the meeting,	no
12192	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	uh of hits.	no
12193	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	What - what kind of uh - what does that look like? The string that you type in. What are you - are you - are they keywords, or are they - ? O_K.	no
12194	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Keywords.	no
12195	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I see.	no
12196	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Right? And so - and then it munges it to pass it to the THISL I_R which uses an S_G_M_L-like	no
12197	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	format for everything.	no
12198	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I  see.	no
12199	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	And then	no
12200	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	does it play something back or that's something you're having to program?	no
12201	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Um, right now, I have a tool that will  do  that on a command line using our standard tools,	no
12202	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
12203	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	but my intention is to do a prettier user interface based  either  -	no
12204	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So - so that's the other thing I wanted to  discuss,  is well what should we  do  for the user interface? We have	no
12205	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	two  tools that have already been written. Um the  SoftSound  guys did a  web-based  one,	no
12206	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Mm-hmm.	no
12207	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	um, which I haven't used, haven't looked at. Dan says it's pretty good	no
12208	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Mm-hmm.	no
12209	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	but it  does  mean you need to be running a web server.	no
12210	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Mm-hmm.	no
12211	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	And so it - it's pretty big and complex.	no
12212	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Uh and it would be difficult to port to Windows because it means porting the  web  server to Windows.	no
12213	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Mm-hmm.	no
12214	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Uh the other option is Dan did the Tcl-T_K THISL GUI front-end	no
12215	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
12216	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	for Broadcast News which I think looks great. I think that's a nice demo.	no
12217	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Um and that would be much easier to port to Windows.	no
12218	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	And so I think  that's  the way we should  go.	no
12219	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I - Can I ask a question? So um	no
12220	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Mm-hmm.	no
12221	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	as it stands within the - the Channeltrans interface, it's  possible  to do a find and a play.	no
12222	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	You can find a searched string and play. So e- Are you - So you're adding like um,	no
12223	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I don't know, uh are they fuzzy matches or are they  uh - ?	no
12224	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	It's a sort of standard,	no
12225	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	text-retrieval-based -	no
12226	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So it's uh term frequency, inverse document frequency scoring.	no
12227	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K.	no
12228	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Um	no
12229	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	and then there are all sorts of metrics for spacing how far apart they have to be and things like that.	no
12230	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So it - it's	no
12231	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	It's a lot more sophisticated than the uh	no
12232	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	i-	no
12233	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	it's like doing a Google query or anyth- anything else like that.	no
12234	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	the basically Windows-based -	no
12235	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So i- it uses - So it pr- produces an index ahead of time so you don't - you're not doing a linear search through all the documents.	no
12236	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K.	no
12237	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Cuz you can imagine if - with - if we have the sixty hours' worth you do - wouldn't wanna do a search.	no
12238	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Hm-mmm.	no
12239	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Um you have to do preindexing and so that - these tools do all that.	no
12240	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Good.	no
12241	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	And so the work to get the  front-end  to work would be porting it -	no
12242	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	well -	no
12243	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	uh to get it to work on the  UNIX  systems,  our  side is just	no
12244	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	rewriting them and modifying them	no
12245	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	to work for  meetings.  So that it understands that they're different speakers and that it's one big audio file instead of a bunch of little ones and just	no
12246	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Mm-hmm.	no
12247	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Mm-hmm.	no
12248	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	sorta things like that.	no
12249	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Mm-hmm.	no
12250	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So what does the user see as the result of the query?	no
12251	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	On  which  tool?	no
12252	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	THISL.	no
12253	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	The THISL GUI tool which is the one that Dan wrote, Tcl-T_K	no
12254	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
12255	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	um you type in a query and then you get back a list	no
12256	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	of hits	no
12257	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	and you can type on them and listen to them.	no
12258	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Click  on them rather  with a mouse.	no
12259	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Ah.	no
12260	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	"So if you typed in ""small heads"" or something you could"	no
12261	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Mmm	no
12262	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Right, you'd get -	no
12263	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	get back a uh uh	no
12264	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	something -	no
12265	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	something that would let you click and listen to some audio where that phrase had occurred or some-	no
12266	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	"You - you'd get to listen to ""beep""."	no
12267	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	That was a really good look.  It's too bad that that couldn't  come into the -	no
12268	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	You couldn't get a video.	no
12269	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Guess who I practice on?	no
12270	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	At  some  point we're gonna have to say what that private joke  is,  that keeps coming up.	no
12271	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
12272	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	And then again, maybe not. So,  uh -	no
12273	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah, that soun- that sounds reasonable. Yeah, it loo- it - my - my recollection of it is it's - it's a pretty reasonable	no
12274	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Right.	no
12275	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	uh demo sort of format.	no
12276	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah that sounds good. That sounds really neat.	no
12277	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	And so I think	no
12278	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	there'd be minimal effort to get it to work,  minimally  and then we'd  wanna   add things like query by speaker and by meeting and all that sort of stuff.	no
12279	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Um Dave Gelbart expressed some interest in working on that so I'll work with him on it.	no
12280	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	And it - it's looking pretty good, you know, the fact that I got the query system working.	no
12281	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So if we wanna just do a video-based one I think that'll be easy.	no
12282	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Mm-hmm.	no
12283	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	If we wanna get it to Windows it's gonna be a little more work because the	no
12284	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	THISL	no
12285	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I_R, the information retrieval tool's - um, I had difficulty just compiling them on Solaris.	no
12286	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Mm-hmm.	no
12287	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So getting them to compile on	no
12288	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Windows might be challenging.	no
12289	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Mm-hmm.	no
12290	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	But you were saying that - that the uh -	no
12291	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So.	no
12292	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	that there's that set of tools, uh,  Cygnus  tools, that -	no
12293	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	It certainly helps. Um, I mean  without  those I wouldn't even  attempt  it.	no
12294	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Uh-huh.	no
12295	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
12296	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Mm-hmm.	no
12297	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	But what those - they - what those do is provide sort of a B_S_D compatibility layer,	no
12298	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	so that the normal UNIX function calls all work.	no
12299	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Mm-hmm.	no
12300	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Mm-hmm.	no
12301	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Um,	no
12302	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	And you have to have all the o-	no
12303	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	But the  problem  is that - that the THISL tools didn't use anything like Autoconf	no
12304	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	and so you have the normal porting problems of	no
12305	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	different header files and th- some things are defined and some things aren't	no
12306	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	and uh	no
12307	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	different compiler work-arounds and so on. So the fact that	no
12308	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	um it took me a day to get it c- to compile under  Solaris  means it's probably gonna take me	no
12309	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	s- significantly  more  than that to get it to compile under Windows.	no
12310	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	How about having it run under  free   B_S_D?	no
12311	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Well what you need -	no
12312	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Free B_S_D would probably be easier.	no
12313	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	All you need to do is say to Dan	no
12314	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	"""gee it would be nice if this worked under  Autoconf "" and it'll be done in a day."	no
12315	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	That's  true.	no
12316	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Right?	no
12317	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Uh -	no
12318	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Actually you know I should  check  because he did port it to  SPRACHcore	no
12319	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	so he might have  done  that  already.	no
12320	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Right.	no
12321	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I - I - I wouldn't be surprised.	no
12322	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So -	no
12323	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I'll check at that -	no
12324	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	How does it play?	no
12325	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	What I -	no
12326	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	But it would - what would serve - would serve both purposes, is if you contact him and ask him if he's already done it.	no
12327	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah, right.	no
12328	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	If he has then you learn, if he hasn't then he'll  do  it.	no
12329	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Right.	no
12330	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Wow.	no
12331	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I hope he never listens to these meetings.	no
12332	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	That's right.	no
12333	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So, and I've been corresponding with Dan and also with uh	no
12334	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	It's amazing.	no
12335	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
12336	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	uh,	no
12337	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	SoftSound  guy, uh -	no
12338	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Blanking on his name.	no
12339	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Tony Robinson?	no
12340	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Tony Robinson?	no
12341	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Do I mean Tony? I guess I  do.	no
12342	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
12343	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Or S- or Steve Renals.	no
12344	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	James Christie.	no
12345	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Which one do I mean?	no
12346	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Steve Renal- Steve Renals.	no
12347	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Steve Renals is not SoftSound, is he?	no
12348	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	No.	no
12349	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	My brain is not working, I don't remember who I've been corresponding with.	no
12350	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K.	no
12351	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Steve wro- i- it's Ste- Steve Renals wrote	no
12352	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	THISL I_R.	no
12353	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Then it's Steve Renals.	no
12354	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K.	no
12355	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Oh, O_K.	no
12356	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So uh just getting documentation and uh and f- and formats, so that's all going pretty well, I think we'll be O_K with that.	no
12357	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
12358	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Right.	no
12359	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Assuming we're -	no
12360	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	What about issues of playing  sound  files  @@  between the two platforms?	no
12361	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Um	no
12362	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	we have -	no
12363	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Well,  that's  a good point too.	no
12364	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Here's a - here's a crazy idea  actually.	no
12365	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I don't know.	no
12366	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Why don't you try and merge  Transcriber  and THISL I_R?	no
12367	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Well this is one of the reasons -	no
12368	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	They're both Tcl interfaces.	no
12369	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	This is the - one of the reasons that I'm gonna have uh Dave Gelbart - Gelbart -	no
12370	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Having him volunteer to work on it is a really good thing	no
12371	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	because he's worked on the Transcriber stuff	no
12372	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Right.	no
12373	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	and he's more familiar with Tcl-T_K than I am.	no
12374	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	And then you get - they - then you get the Windows media playing for free.	no
12375	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Well that's  Snack,  not - not Transcriber.	no
12376	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Right.  But the point is that the Transcriber uses Snack and then you can - but you can use a - a lot of the same functionality and it's -	no
12377	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah, yeah, I mean, I - I think THISL - THISL GUI  probably  uses Snack.	no
12378	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	And so my intention was just to base it on that.	no
12379	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
12380	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Well my thought was is that it would be nice - it would be nice to have the running transcripts	no
12381	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	And if it  doesn't  -	no
12382	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	um eh you know, from speaker to speaker.	no
12383	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Right? Do you have - you have, you know, a speaker mark here and a speaker mark here?	no
12384	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Right, we'll have to figure out a user interface for that, so.	no
12385	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Right.	no
12386	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Well that - eh my thought was if you had like Multitrans or whatever	no
12387	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	do  it.	no
12388	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Or whatever.	no
12389	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
12390	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	It might be  fairly  difficult to get that to work in	no
12391	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	the little short segments we'd be talking about and having	no
12392	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	the search tools and so on. We - we can look into it, but -	no
12393	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
12394	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	The thing I was asking about with, um, free B_S_D is that it might be easier to	no
12395	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	get PowerPoint shows	no
12396	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	running in free B_S_D than to get this other package running in -	no
12397	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah, I mean we have to - I have to sit down and  try  it before I make too many judgments, so uh	no
12398	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
12399	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Um	no
12400	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	My experience with the Gnu compatibility library is  really	no
12401	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	it's just as hard and just as easy to port to any system.	no
12402	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Right? The Windows system isn't any harder because it - it looks like a B_S_D system.	no
12403	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Mm-hmm.	no
12404	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	"It's just, you know, just like all of them, the ""include"" files are a little different and the function calls are a little different."	no
12405	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Right.	no
12406	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So I - it  might  be a little easier but it's not gonna be a lot easier.	no
12407	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K.	no
12408	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So there was  that  demo, which was one of the main ones, then we talked about	no
12409	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	um some  other  stuff which would basically be	no
12410	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	um showing off the - the Transcriber interface  itself  and as you say,  maybe  we could even  merge  those in some sense, but - but um,	no
12411	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	uh - and part of that was showing off what the speech-non- uh nonspeech  stuff that Thilo has done   s-   looks like.	no
12412	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
12413	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Can I ask one more thing about THISL?	no
12414	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Mm-hmm.	no
12415	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So with the I_R stuff then you end up with a somewhat prioritized um - ?	no
12416	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Mm-hmm, ranked.	no
12417	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Excellent. Excellent.	no
12418	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
12419	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So  another  idea I w- t- had	no
12420	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	just now actually for the  demo  was	no
12421	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	whether it might be of interest to sh- to show some of the prosody uh	no
12422	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	work that  Don's  been doing.	no
12423	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Mm-hmm.	no
12424	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Um actually show some of the  features  and then show for instance a task like finding sentence boundaries or finding turn boundaries.	no
12425	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Um,	no
12426	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	you know, you can show that  graphically,  sort of what the features are doing. It, you know, it doesn't work  great  but it's definitely giving us  something.	no
12427	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Well I think at -	no
12428	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I don't know if that would be of interest or not.	no
12429	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	at the very least we're gonna want something  illustrative  with that cuz I'm gonna want to  talk  about it and so i- if there's something that shows it  graphically	no
12430	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
12431	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	it's much better than me just having a bullet point	no
12432	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	pointing at something I don't  know  much about, so.	no
12433	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I mean, you're looking at this now - Are you looking at Waves or Matlab?	no
12434	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Um yeah I'm  starting  to and	no
12435	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	um -	no
12436	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah we can  probably  find some examples	no
12437	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	of different type of prosodic	no
12438	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah def-	no
12439	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	events going on.	no
12440	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	S- so when we here were having this demo meeting, what we're  sort  of coming up with is that we wanna have all these pieces together, to first order, by the end of the month	no
12441	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I-	no
12442	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	and then that'll give us a week or so.	no
12443	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Oh, the end of  this  month or next month?	no
12444	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Ooo. The end of -	no
12445	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	This  month.	no
12446	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Oh, you mean like  today?	no
12447	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Ju-	no
12448	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Oh.	no
12449	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Oh sorry,  next  month.  Today isn't  June first, is it.	no
12450	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	June. June. June.	no
12451	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Next  month. Sorry.  O_K.	no
12452	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
12453	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	There's another one.	no
12454	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Exactly.	no
12455	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Uh -	no
12456	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	that'll - that'll give us -	no
12457	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Sorry.	no
12458	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	that'll give us a week or so to uh - to port things over to my laptop and make sure  that  works, yeah.	no
12459	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I think, I mean eh where -	no
12460	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah, I mean  I'll  be here.	no
12461	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah if d- if Don can sort of talk to whoever's - cuz we're doing this anyway as part of our -	no
12462	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
12463	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	you know, the  research,  visualizing what these features are doing and so either -	no
12464	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
12465	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	it might not be integrated but it -	no
12466	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	it could potentially be in it.	no
12467	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Could find some.	no
12468	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah. Well, this is to an audience of researchers so I mean, you know,	no
12469	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	to let s- the goal is to let them know what it is we're doing. So that's -	no
12470	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I mean it's  different.	no
12471	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I don't think anyone has  done  this on meeting data so it might be neat, you know.	no
12472	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	yes
12473	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I don't think anyone has  done  this on meeting data so it might be neat, you know.	no
12474	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
12475	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Good.	no
12476	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Done with that.	no
12477	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	X_M_L tools?	no
12478	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Um.	no
12479	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So I've been doing a bunch of X_M_L tools where you - we're sort of moving to X_M_L as the	no
12480	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	general format for everything and I think that's definitely the right way to go because there are a lot of tools	no
12481	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	that let you do extraction and reformatting of X_M_L tools.	no
12482	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Um.	no
12483	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So yet again we should probably meet to talk about  transcription  formats in X_M_L because I'm not particularly  happy  with what we have now.	no
12484	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I mean it works with  Transcriber  but it - it's a  pain  to use it in other tools	no
12485	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	uh because it doesn't mark start and end.	no
12486	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Start and end of each - ?	no
12487	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Uh -	no
12488	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
12489	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Utterance.	no
12490	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Utterance. Just marks - ?	no
12491	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So it's  implicit  in -  in  there but you have to do a lot of processing to get it.	no
12492	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
12493	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Right.  Right.	no
12494	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	And so - and also I'd like to do the indirect time line business.	no
12495	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Um but  regardless,  I mean, w- that's something that you, me, and Jane can talk about later. Um,	no
12496	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	but I've installed X_M_L tools of various sorts in various languages and so if people are interested in doing -	no
12497	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	extracting any information from  any  of these files, either uh information on	no
12498	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	users  because the user database is that way -	no
12499	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I'm converting the Key files to X_M_L so that you can extract m- uh	no
12500	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Cool.	no
12501	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	various inf- uh sorted information on individual  meetings	no
12502	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
12503	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	and then also the  transcripts.  And so l- just let me know there - it's mostly Java and Perl	no
12504	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	but we can get other languages too if - if that's desirable.	no
12505	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Oh, quick  question  on that. Is - do we have the -  the seat information?	no
12506	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	In - in the Key files now?	no
12507	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Mm-hmm.	no
12508	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	The seat information is on the Key files for the ones which	no
12509	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Ah.	no
12510	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Oh in -	no
12511	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	it's been recorded, yeah.	no
12512	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	For the new one- O_K. Great.	no
12513	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Seat?	no
12514	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Sea- yeah.	no
12515	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Where - where you're sitting.	no
12516	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Oh! Not - not the  quality  or anything. No. O_K.  I see.	no
12517	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	n-	no
12518	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	"Right.  ""It's pretty soft and squishy."""	no
12519	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
12520	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Alright .	no
12521	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
12522	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K.	no
12523	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Oh, but  that  might just be  me.	no
12524	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K.	no
12525	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Um.	no
12526	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Alright.	no
12527	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	That's more seat information than we wanted.	no
12528	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Never mind.	no
12529	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Hmm.	no
12530	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I'm just trying to figure out, you know, when Morgan's voice appears on someone's microphone are they  next  to him or are they  across  from him?	no
12531	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Maybe we should bleep that out.	no
12532	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
12533	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Mmm, yeah.	no
12534	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Wait a minute, how - how w- eh  where  is it in the Key file?	no
12535	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Right.	no
12536	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
12537	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	The square bracket.	no
12538	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Cuz	no
12539	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I mean  I  haven't been putting it in and -  in by  -	no
12540	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	You  haven't  been putting it in.	no
12541	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Right.  I have not. And -	no
12542	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Well bu-	no
12543	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Oh, O_K.	no
12544	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Isn't it always on the  digits?	no
12545	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Some  of these are  missing.   Aren't  they?	no
12546	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Isn't it always on the digits forms?	no
12547	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Some fall out of -	no
12548	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Well  it-	no
12549	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah so we can go back and fill  them   in for the ones we have.	no
12550	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Ooo.	no
12551	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I mean they're on th- right,  these,  but I just hadn't ever been putting it in the  Key  files. And I don't think  Chuck  was either cuz -	no
12552	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah I - I never -	no
12553	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I never knew we were supposed to put it in the Key file.	no
12554	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I  had  told you guys about it but -	no
12555	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Oh, so we're both sorry. So -	no
12556	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Oh really?	no
12557	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I mean this is why I wanna use a g- a tool to do it rather than the plain text because with the plain text it's very easy to skip those things.	no
12558	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K.	no
12559	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K.	no
12560	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K.	no
12561	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So.	no
12562	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Um if you use the Edit-key,	no
12563	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	or Key-edit - I think it's Edit-key,	no
12564	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Edit-key.	no
12565	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	command -	no
12566	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Did I show you guys that?	no
12567	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yep.	no
12568	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	"I  did  show it to you, but I think you both said ""no, you'll just use"	no
12569	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	You  mentioned  it, yeah. Yeah.	no
12570	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	"text file"". Um it has it in there, a place to fill it in."	no
12571	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Text.	no
12572	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K.	no
12573	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K.	no
12574	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah, and so if you don't fill it in, you're not gonna get it in the meetings. So.	no
12575	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So if -	no
12576	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Right. Well I - I just realized I hadn't been doing it and probably - So -	no
12577	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yep.	no
12578	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	u-	no
12579	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah and then the other thing also that Thilo noticed is, on the microphone,	no
12580	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	on channel zero it says hand-held mike  or  Crown mike,	no
12581	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
12582	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Right.	no
12583	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	you actually have to  say  which  one.  So.	no
12584	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I know - Yeah, I usually delete the -	no
12585	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I don't, maybe I forgot to d-	no
12586	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Oh! O_K. I didn't do that  either.	no
12587	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
12588	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Takes me no time at all to edit these.	no
12589	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	But it's almost -	no
12590	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
12591	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah that's cuz you kn- I - I know  why.	no
12592	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I'm not  doing  anything.	no
12593	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	"And I was - I was looking at  Chuck's,  like, ""oh what did  Chuck  do, O_K I'll do  that "". So."	no
12594	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	"And then uh also in a couple of places instead of filling the participants under ""participants"" they were filled in under ""description""."	no
12595	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Ah, O_K.	no
12596	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Uh -	no
12597	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	And so that's also a problem.	no
12598	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So  anyway.	no
12599	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	We will do better.	no
12600	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	That's it.	no
12601	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Oh uh also I'm working on another version of this tool,	no
12602	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	the - the one that shows up here,	no
12603	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	that will flash yellow if the mike isn't connected.	no
12604	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	And it's not quite ready to go yet because um	no
12605	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	it's hard to  tell  whether the mike's connected or not because	no
12606	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	the best quality ones, the Crown ones,	no
12607	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	are about the same level if they're off	no
12608	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	and no one's o- off or if they're on and no one's talking.	no
12609	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Huh.	no
12610	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Um these -  these  ones, they	no
12611	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	are much easier, there's a bigger difference.	no
12612	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So I'm working on that and it - it sorta works and so eventually we will change to that and then you'll be able to see graphically if your mike is dropping in or out.	no
12613	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Will that also include like batteries dying?	no
12614	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yep.	no
12615	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Just a- any time the mike's putting out zeros basically.	no
12616	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yep.	no
12617	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yep.	no
12618	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	But with the  screensaver  kicking in, it -	no
12619	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Now -	no
12620	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	But y- yeah.	no
12621	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Well I'll turn off the screensaver  too.	no
12622	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
12623	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
12624	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Oops.  Speaking of which.	no
12625	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Um the  other  thing is as I've said before, it is actually  on	no
12626	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	the  thing.  There's a little level meter	no
12627	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	but of course no one ever pays  attention  to it. So I think having it on the screen	no
12628	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	is more easy to notice.	no
12629	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	It would be nice if - if these had little  light  indicators, little L_E_Ds for -	no
12630	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	"Uh buzzer.  ""Bamp, bamp!"""	no
12631	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah, a buzzer.	no
12632	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Small shocks	no
12633	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	administered to the -	no
12634	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
12635	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Actually -	no
12636	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K.	no
12637	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Oh -	no
12638	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K, disk backup, et cetera?	yes
12639	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Oh -	no
12640	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K, disk backup, et cetera?	no
12641	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Um I spoke with Dave Johnson about putting all the Meeting Recorder stuff on non-backed-up disk to save the overhead of backup	no
12642	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	"and he pretty much said ""yeah, you could do that if you want"""	no
12643	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	but he thought it was a bad idea.	no
12644	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	In fact what  he  said is	no
12645	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	doing the manual one,	no
12646	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	doing uh N_W archive to copy it	no
12647	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	is a good idea	no
12648	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	and we should do that  and  have it backed up.	no
12649	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	He w- he's a firm believer in - in lots of different modalities of backup.	no
12650	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I mean, his point was well taken. This data cannot be recovered.	no
12651	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
12652	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	And so if a mistake is made and we lose the backup	no
12653	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	we should have the  archive  and if then a mistake is made and we lose the  archive  we should have the  backup.	no
12654	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Well I guess it  is  true that even with something that's backed  up  it's	no
12655	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	not gonna -	no
12656	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	if it's stationary it's not going to go through the increment- it's not gonna burden things in the incremental backups.	no
12657	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Just - just the monthly full.	no
12658	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Hmm.	no
12659	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah, so the monthly full will be a bear but -	no
12660	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah. But he said	no
12661	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	that -	no
12662	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	that we sh-	no
12663	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	shouldn't  worry  too  much about that,	no
12664	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	that we're getting a new backup system and we're far enough away from saturation on full backups that it's w-	no
12665	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Really?	no
12666	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	probably  O_K.	no
12667	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	And uh, so the only issue here is the timing between	no
12668	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	getting more disks and	no
12669	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	uh	no
12670	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	recording meetings.	no
12671	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So I guess the idea is that we would be reserving the	no
12672	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	non-backed-up space for things	no
12673	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	that took less than twenty-four hours to recreate or something like that, right?	no
12674	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Things that are recreatable easily and also - Yeah, basically things that are  recreatable.	no
12675	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
12676	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
12677	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	The expanded files and things like that.	no
12678	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K .	no
12679	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	They take up a lot more room anyway.	no
12680	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
12681	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Uh but we do need more disk.	no
12682	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So we can get more disk. Yeah. So.	no
12683	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
12684	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	And I - I think I agree with him.  I mean  his point was well taken that	no
12685	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	if we lose one of these we cannot get it back.	no
12686	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K.	no
12687	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I don't think there was any other et  cetera  there.	no
12688	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Well I was allowing someone else to come up with something related that they had uh -	no
12689	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I  thought  you guys were gonna burn C_Ds?	no
12690	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Um  unfortunately  - we could  burn  C_Ds but first of all it's a  pain.	no
12691	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
12692	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Because you have to copy it down to the P_C and then	no
12693	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	burn it and that's a multi-step procedure.	no
12694	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	And second of all the - the write-once burners as opposed to a professional press don't last.	no
12695	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
12696	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So I think burning them for  distribution  is fine	no
12697	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	but burning them for  backup  is not a good idea.	no
12698	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I see.	no
12699	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Cuz th- they - they	no
12700	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K.	no
12701	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	fail  after a couple years.	no
12702	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Alright.	no
12703	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I  do  have uh uh - It's a different topic. Can I add one top- topic? We have time?	no
12704	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I wanted to ask, I know that uh that Thilo you were, um,	no
12705	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	bringing the Channeltrans interface onto the Windows machine?	no
12706	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah it's - it - Basically it's done, yeah.	no
12707	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	And I wanted to know is th-	no
12708	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	It's all done? That's g- wonderful. Great.	no
12709	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
12710	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yes, since Tcl-T_K  runs  on it, basically	no
12711	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah it -	no
12712	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	things'll just work.	no
12713	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah, it was just a problem with the Snack version and the Transcriber version but	no
12714	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	it's solved. So.	no
12715	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Does - and that - does that mean, I -	no
12716	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	maybe I should know this but I don't. Does this mean that the - that this could be por- uh ported to a Think-Pad note- or some other type of uh -	no
12717	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah, basically uh I	no
12718	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	did install it on my laptop and yeah	no
12719	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Wonderful.	no
12720	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	it worked.	no
12721	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Hmm!	no
12722	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Wonderful.	yes
12723	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Hmm!	no
12724	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Wonderful.	no
12725	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Good.	no
12726	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	CrossPads?	no
12727	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Uh got an email from uh	no
12728	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	"James Landay who basically said ""if you're not using them,"	no
12729	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	"could you return them?"""	no
12730	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So he said he doesn't need them, he just	no
12731	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	periodically w- at the end of each term sends out email to everyone who was recorded as having them	no
12732	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	and asks them if they're still using them.	no
12733	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So we've  never  used them.	no
12734	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	We used them once.	no
12735	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	We - we used them a couple times, but -	no
12736	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Once?	no
12737	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Mm-hmm.	no
12738	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Them? There's more than one?	no
12739	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Couple times.	no
12740	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah, we have two.	no
12741	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
12742	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	i-	no
12743	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Um.	no
12744	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	But -	no
12745	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	My  opinion on it is, first, I never take notes anyway	no
12746	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	so  I'm  not gonna use it,	no
12747	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	um and  second,  it's  another  level of infrastructure that we have to deal with.	no
12748	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	And I have - uh so my - my feeling on it is that I think in  principle  it's a really nice idea, and you have the  time  tags which makes it  better  tha- than just taking ra-  raw  notes. On the  other  hand,	no
12749	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I - the  down  side for  me  was that	no
12750	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I think the  pen  is really noisy.	no
12751	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So you have ka- kaplunk, kaplunk, kaplunk.	no
12752	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	And I - and I don't know if it's audible on the -	no
12753	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	but I - I sort of thought that was a disadvantage. I  do  take notes, I mean, I could be taking notes on these things and I guess the  plus  with the CrossPads would be the  time  markings but -	no
12754	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I don't know.	no
12755	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Uh, what  is  a CrossPad?	no
12756	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So it's - it's um - it's a regular pad, just a regular pad of paper but there's this  pen	no
12757	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Thank you.	no
12758	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	which indicates  position.	no
12759	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	And so you have time and position	no
12760	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K.	no
12761	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	stuff  stored  so that you can - you have a record of whatever it is you've  written.	no
12762	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K.	no
12763	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	And then you can download it and they have O_C_R and searching and all sorts of things.	no
12764	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K.	no
12765	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K.	no
12766	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So i- if you take notes it's a great little device.	no
12767	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Could - Mm-hmm.	no
12768	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	But I don't take notes, so.	no
12769	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	And one of the reasons that it was brought  up  originally was because uh we were interested in - in higher-level things, not just the, you know, microphone stuff but also summarization and	no
12770	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	so forth and the question is if you were going to go to some gold  standard  of what wa- what  was  it that happened in the meeting	no
12771	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	you know, where would it  come  from? And um I  think  that was one of the	no
12772	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
12773	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yep.	no
12774	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
12775	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	things, right? And so the - it seemed like a neat  idea.  We'll have a - you know, have a scribe,	no
12776	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	have somebody uh take good notes and then that's part of the record of the meeting.	no
12777	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	And then we did it once or twice and we sort of -	no
12778	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yep, and then just sort of died out.	no
12779	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	probably chose the wrong  scribe  but  it was  -  It's uh -	no
12780	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I mean -	no
12781	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah that's right.	no
12782	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Well I  did  it  one  time but um -	no
12783	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yep.	no
12784	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
12785	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	u-	no
12786	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	but I guess the - the  other	no
12787	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	thing I'm thinking is if we wanted that kind of thing I wonder if we'd	no
12788	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	lose  that much by having someone be a scribe by listening to the tape, to the recording  afterwards  and	no
12789	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	taking notes in some other interface.	no
12790	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I mean we're  transcribing  it  anyways,  why do we need  notes?	no
12791	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Oh it's la- it's  useful,  have a  summary  and  high  points.	no
12792	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Because that's  summary.	no
12793	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I think -	no
12794	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Summary.	no
12795	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	there's also -	no
12796	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	there's this use that -	no
12797	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Summarize it from the  transcription.	no
12798	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	the -	no
12799	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Well, what if you're sitting there and you just wanna make an X_ and you  don't  wanna take notes and you're - you just wanna	no
12800	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Doodle.	no
12801	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	get  the summary of the transcript from this  time  location like -	no
12802	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	you know, and - and then while you're  bored  you don't do anything and once in a while, maybe there's a  joke  and you put a X_  and -	no
12803	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	But -	no
12804	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	in - in other words you can use that just to  highlight   times	no
12805	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	in a very simple way. Also with - I was thinking and I know Morgan disagrees with me on this but	no
12806	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	suppose you have a group in here and you wanna let them note whenever they think there  might  be something later that they  might  not wanna distribute in terms of content,	no
12807	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	they could just sort of	no
12808	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	make an X_ near that point or a question mark that	no
12809	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	sort of alerts  them  that when they get the  transcript  back they c-	no
12810	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	could get some red flags in that  transcript  region and they can then  look  at it. So.	no
12811	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I know we haven't been using it but	no
12812	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I  w-	no
12813	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I can  imagine  it being useful just for sort of marking  time  periods which you then	no
12814	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Right.	no
12815	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	get back in a  transcript  so.	no
12816	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Well.	no
12817	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I guess -	no
12818	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	so, you know, what - what  makes  one think i- is  maybe  we should actually schedule some periods where people go over something later and - and -	no
12819	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	and put some kind of summary or something uh you know, some - there'd be some scribe	no
12820	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	who would actually listen, w- who'd agreed to actually listen to the whole thing,	no
12821	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	not   transcribe  it, but just sort of write down things that struck them as  important.	no
12822	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	But -	no
12823	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	then you don't - you  don't  have	no
12824	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	the  time  reference	no
12825	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Right.	no
12826	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	uh that you'd have if you had it live.	no
12827	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	And you don't have a lot of other  cues  that  might  be useful, so.	no
12828	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
12829	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	How do you synchronize the time in the  CrossPad  and the time of the  recording?	no
12830	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I mean that was one of the issues we  talked  about  originally  and that- that's w-	no
12831	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	part of the  difficulty  is that we need an  infrastructure  for using the time - the CrossPads and so that means synchronizing the time -	no
12832	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Uh.	no
12833	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Mm-hmm.	no
12834	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	You know you want it pretty  close  and there's a fair amount of  skew  because it's a hand-held unit with a  battery	no
12835	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Well when - when I d-	no
12836	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	and so you -	no
12837	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K.	no
12838	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	so you have to synchronize at the beginning of each meeting all the pads that are being  used,	no
12839	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	so that it's synchronized with the time on  that  and then you have to	no
12840	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	download to an  application,  and then you have to	no
12841	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	figure out what the  data  formats are and convert it  over  if you wanna  do  anything with this information.	no
12842	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	w- Mm-hmm.	no
12843	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	And so there's a lot of  infrastructure  which	no
12844	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Why -	no
12845	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	There  is  an  alternative.	no
12846	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	unless someone -	no
12847	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	There  is  an alternative, I mean, it's  still,  there's uh - you know, your point stands about there be - needing to be an infrastructure, but	no
12848	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	it  doesn't  have to be  synchronized  with the little  clock's  timer on it. You c-	no
12849	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	"I mean, I - when I - when  I  did it I synchronized it  by  voice, by whispering ""one, two, three, four"" onto the microphone  and uh, you know."	no
12850	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Hmm.	no
12851	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Well, but then there's the infrastructure at the other  end  which someone has to  listen  to that and find that  point,	no
12852	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Right.	no
12853	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah, it's transcribed. It's in the transcript.	no
12854	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	and then  mark  it.	no
12855	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So.	no
12856	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
12857	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Well it's in the transcript.	no
12858	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Well, could we keep  one  of these things for another year? Would h- I mean is there a big cau-	no
12859	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	We can keep all -  both  of them for the whole whole year. I mean, it's just -	no
12860	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	just - just in case we -	no
12861	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	even maybe some of the transcribers who might be wanting to  annotate	no
12862	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	uh f- just there's a bunch of things that might be neat to do but I -	no
12863	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	it  might  not be the case that we can actually	no
12864	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	synchronize them and then do all the infrastructure but we could at least try it  out.	no
12865	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Well -	no
12866	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	one thing that we might try	no
12867	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	um	no
12868	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	is on some set of meetings, some collection of meetings, maybe E_D_U is the right one or maybe something else,	no
12869	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	we - we get somebody to buy into the idea of doing this as part of the task. I mean,	no
12870	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Right.	no
12871	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	uh part of the reason - I think part of the reason that Adam was so interested in uh the SpeechCorder sort of f- idea from the beginning is he said from the beginning he hated taking notes and -	no
12872	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yep.	no
12873	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	and so forth so and - and Jane  is  more into it but eh uh	no
12874	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	you know I don't know if you wanna really do -  do  this all the time so I think the thing is to -	no
12875	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	to get someone to actually buy  into  it and have at least  some  series of meetings where we  do  it.	no
12876	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Um -	no
12877	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	and if  so,  it's probably worth having  one.	no
12878	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	The p- the - the problem with the - the more extended view, all these other you know with uh quibbling about particular	no
12879	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	applications of it is that it looks like it's hard to get people to	no
12880	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	um	no
12881	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	uh routinely use it, I mean it just hasn't happened anyway.	no
12882	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	But maybe if we can get a person to -	no
12883	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah I don't think it has to be part of a- what everybody does in a meeting but it might be	no
12884	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	a useful, neat	no
12885	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	part of the project that we can, you know, show off as	no
12886	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	a mechanism for synchronizing events in time	no
12887	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	that happen that you just wanna make a note  of,  like what Jane was talking about	no
12888	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	with some later browsing, just - just as a convenience, even if it's not a full-blown note taking	no
12889	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	substitute.	no
12890	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Well if you wanted to do that maybe the right architecture for it is to get a P_D_A with a wireless card.	no
12891	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	And - and that way you can synchronize very easily with the -	no
12892	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	the - the meeting because you'll be synchroni- you can synchronize with the - the Linux server	no
12893	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	and uh -	no
12894	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So what kind of input would you be - ?	no
12895	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	so - so, I mean, if you're not worried about -	no
12896	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Buttons.	no
12897	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	You'd just be pressing like a - a -	no
12898	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Well - well you have a P_D_A and may- and you could have the same sort of X_ interface or whatever, I mean, you'd have to do a little eh a little bit of coding to do it.	no
12899	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Mm-hmm.	no
12900	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	But you could imagine, I mean, if - if  all  you really  wanted  was - you didn't want this	no
12901	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah, that be good.	no
12902	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	secondary note-taking  channel  but just sort of being able to use m-  markers  of some sort,	no
12903	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	a P_D_A with a l- a wireless card would be the -  probably  the right way to go.	no
12904	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I mean even  buttons  you could do,  sort  of, I mean, as you said.	no
12905	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I mean for what - what  you've  been describing buttons would be even more convenient than anything  else,  right? You have the -	no
12906	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	M- right.	no
12907	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	That would be fine too. I mean, I don't have, you know, grandiose  ideas  in mind but I'm just sort of thinking	no
12908	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Right.	no
12909	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	well we've - we're getting into the next year now and we have a lot of these things worked out at - in terms of the  speech  maybe  somebody  will be  interested  in this and -	no
12910	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I like this P_D_A idea. Yeah.	no
12911	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	"Yeah, I  do  like the idea of having a couple buttons where like one - one button was ""uh-oh"""	no
12912	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Well I'm  sure  there would -	no
12913	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
12914	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
12915	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	"and then another button was ""that's great"" and another button ""that's f-"""	no
12916	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	"Or like this is my ""I'm supposed to do this"" kind of button, like ""I better remember to -"""	no
12917	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
12918	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Action item.	no
12919	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah something like that or -	no
12920	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I mean I think the  CrossPad  idea is a good one.	no
12921	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	And then -	no
12922	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Uh-huh.	no
12923	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	It's just a question of getting people to use it and getting the infrastructure set up in such a way that it's not a lot of extra work.	no
12924	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I mean that's part of the reason why it hasn't happened is that	no
12925	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
12926	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	it's been a lot of extra work for  me	no
12927	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Right.	no
12928	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	and -	no
12929	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Well, and not just for you. But it's also, it has this problem of having to	no
12930	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	W-	no
12931	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	go from an analog to a d-	no
12932	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	a digital record too, doesn't it? I mean -	no
12933	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Well it's  digital  but it's in a format that	no
12934	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	But I mean, say, if i- if -	no
12935	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	is not particularly  standard.	no
12936	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	if you're writing - if you're writing notes in it does - it - it can't  do  handwriting recognition, right?	no
12937	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	No, no, but it's just - it's just storing the pixel	no
12938	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K.	no
12939	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	informa- position information, it's all digital.	no
12940	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I - I guess what I'm thinking is that the P_D_A solution you h- you have it already without needing to go from the pixelization to a -	no
12941	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	to a -	no
12942	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I mean -	no
12943	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Right.	no
12944	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	You don't have to -	no
12945	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	The transfer function is less errorful, yes.	no
12946	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah, yeah.	no
12947	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
12948	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Oh, nicely put.	no
12949	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah. Yeah.	no
12950	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Well it also - it's  maybe  realistic cuz people are supposed to be  bringing  their P_D_As to the meeting eventually, right? That's why we have this little -	no
12951	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I don't know what - I don't wanna cause more work for anyone but I can imagine some interesting	no
12952	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	things that you could  do  with it and so if we don't  have  to return it	no
12953	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	and we can	no
12954	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	keep it for a year -   I don't know.	no
12955	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Well -	no
12956	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	w- we don't - we  certainly  don't have to return it, as I said. All - all  he  said is that if you're not using it could you return it, if you  are  using it feel free to  keep  it.	no
12957	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	The  point  is that we haven't used it at  all  and  are  we  going  to?	no
12958	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So we have no but - uh by I - I would suggest you return one.	no
12959	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K.	no
12960	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
12961	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Because we - we you know, we - we  haven't  used it at all.	no
12962	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	We c-	no
12963	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	We have some  aspirations  of using them and -	no
12964	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	One would probably be fine.	no
12965	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Maybe we could do like a  student  project, you know, maybe someone who wants to do this as their main like	no
12966	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
12967	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	s- project for something would be cool.	no
12968	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yep.	no
12969	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I mean if we had them out and sitting on the table people might use them a little more	no
12970	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Maybe Jeremy could sit in some meetings and press a button when there - when - when somebody laughed.	no
12971	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	although there is a little -	no
12972	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Well, I'm -  yeah,  that's  not  a bad -	no
12973	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah, yeah.	no
12974	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
12975	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Jeremy's gonna be	no
12976	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	an - he's a new student starting on modeling brea- breath and laughter, actually, which	no
12977	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	sounds  funny but I think it should be cool, so.	no
12978	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
12979	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Sounds  breathy  to me.	no
12980	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K.	no
12981	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	"Breath and lau- ""ha-ha-ha-ha""."	no
12982	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	"""Ha-ha-ha."""	no
12983	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	"""Ha-ha-ha-ha."""	no
12984	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Well  dear.	no
12985	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Um.	no
12986	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Hmm.	no
12987	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	That reminded me of something. Oh well, too late.	no
12988	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	It slipped out.	no
12989	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K.	no
12990	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Oh,  equipment.	no
12991	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	You're - you're gonna  tease  me? O_K.	no
12992	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Ordered - Uh, well I'm  always  gonna do  that.  W- uh -	no
12993	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	We ordered uh more	no
12994	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	wireless,  and so they should be coming in at some point.	no
12995	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Great.	no
12996	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	And then at the same time I'll probably rewire the room as per Jane's suggestion so that	no
12997	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	uh the first N_ channels are wireless, eh are the m- the close-talking and the next N_ are far-field.	no
12998	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	"You know what he means but isn't that funny sounding? ""We ordered more  wireless. "" It's like  wires  are the  things  so you're  wiring   - you're - you're -  you  - we're - we ordered more  absence  of the thing."	no
12999	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	That's a very philosophical	no
13000	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	statement from Morgan. I just - it's sort of a anachronism, I mean it's like -	no
13001	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	wired less , wired more.	no
13002	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Anyway.	no
13003	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	It's great.	no
13004	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Should we do digits? Do we have anything else?	yes
13005	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Anyway.	no
13006	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Should we do digits? Do we have anything else?	no
13007	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
13008	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K.	no
13009	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I mean there's - there's all this stuff going on uh between uh	no
13010	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Andreas and - and - and Dave and Chuck and others with various kinds of runs uh um -	no
13011	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	recognition  runs, trying to figure things out about the features but it's -	no
13012	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	it's all sort of in process, so there's not much to say	no
13013	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	right now.	no
13014	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Uh why don't we start with our - our esteemed guest.	no
13015	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K.	no
13016	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Alright.	no
13017	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	So just the transcript number and then the - then the -	no
13018	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	This is -	no
13019	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yes, this is number two for me today.	no
13020	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	See all you have to do is go away to move way up in the -	no
13021	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Oh.	no
13022	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	We could do  simultaneous.	no
13023	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Initiate  him.	no
13024	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	We - we  could.	no
13025	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Should we  do  simultaneous?	no
13026	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Well, I'm just thinking, are you gonna try to  save  the data before this next group comes  in?	no
13027	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah.	no
13028	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah, absolutely.	no
13029	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Yeah, so we might wanna do it simultaneous.	no
13030	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	I mean you hav- sorta  have  to.	no
13031	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Right, so -	no
13032	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Well O_K, so let's do one of those simultaneous ones. That sounds good.	no
13033	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	so we might n-	no
13034	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	we might need to do that actually.	no
13035	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K.	no
13036	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K.	no
13037	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Everybody ready?	no

13039	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	A one.	no
13040	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	You have to plug your ears, by the way uh Eric, or -	no
13041	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	Well  I  have to, I don't know about  other  people.	no
13042	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	O_K, alright.	no
13043	transcript	transcript_Bmr025	You don't  have  to.	no

13137	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Well, I'm - I sent a couple of items. They're - they're sort of  practical.  I don't know if you're -	no
13138	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I thought  somebody had. Yeah, that's right.	no
13139	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	if - if that's too  practical  for what we're  focused on.	no
13140	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah, we only want th-  useless  things. Yeah.  No, why don't we talk about  practical  things? Sure.	no
13141	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I mean, we don't want anything too practical.  Yeah, that would be -	no
13142	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K.	no
13143	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Well, um, I can  give you an update on the  transcription effort.	no
13144	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Great.	no
13145	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Uh, maybe  raise the issue of microphone, uh,  um  procedures	no
13146	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	b-	no
13147	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	with reference to the  cleanliness of the recordings.	no
13148	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K,  transcription,  uh, microphone issues -	no
13149	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And  then  maybe  ask, th- uh,  these  guys. The - we have great - great, uh, p- steps forward in terms of the nonspeech-speech pre-segmenting of the signal.	no
13150	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K.	no
13151	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Well, we have  steps  forward.	no
13152	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Well, it's a - it's a big improvement.	no
13153	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13154	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yes.	no
13155	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I would prefer this.	no
13156	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah, well. O_K.	no
13157	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Uh -	no
13158	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	We talk about the -  the results of	no
13159	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	You have some -	no
13160	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13161	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K.	no
13162	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I have a little bit of I_RAM stuff but  I'm not sure if that's of general interest or not.	no
13163	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	use -	no
13164	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Uh, bigram?	no
13165	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I_RAM .	no
13166	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I_RAM .	no
13167	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I_RAM.	no
13168	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Well, m- maybe.	no
13169	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I_RAM, bigram, you know.	no
13170	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Bi- Bigram.	no
13171	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah, let's - let's see where we are at three-thirty. Um -	no
13172	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Hmm.	no
13173	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Since, uh - since I have to leave as usual at three-thirty, can we do the interesting stuff first?	no
13174	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I beg your pardon?	no
13175	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Well -	no
13176	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13177	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	What's the interesting stuff?	no
13178	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Which  is  - ?	no
13179	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I beg your pardon?	no
13180	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. Th- now you get to tell us what's the interesting part. But - Yeah.	no
13181	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Please specify.	no
13182	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13183	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Well, uh, I guess the	no
13184	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	work that's been  done on segmentation would be most - Yeah.	no
13185	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I think that would be a good thing to start with.	no
13186	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K.	no
13187	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Um, and, um,  the  other  thing, uh, which  I'll  just say very briefly that maybe relates to that a little bit, which is that, um,	no
13188	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	uh, one of the suggestions that came up in a brief meeting I had the other day when I was in  Spain	no
13189	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	with, uh, Manolo Pardo and	no
13190	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Javier, uh, Ferreiros, who was  here  before,	no
13191	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13192	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	was, um,	no
13193	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	why not  start  with	no
13194	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	what they had  before  but add in	no
13195	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	the non-silence boundaries.	no
13196	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	So, in what Javier did before when they were doing, um -	no
13197	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	h- he was looking for, uh, speaker  change   points.	no
13198	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
13199	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Um.	no
13200	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	As a simplification, he originally did this only using   silence	no
13201	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	as, uh, a  putative, uh, speaker  change  point.	no
13202	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13203	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And, uh, he did not, say, look at points where you were changing broad sp- uh, phonetic class, for instance.	no
13204	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And for Broadcast News, that was fine.	no
13205	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Here  obviously it's  not.	no
13206	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13207	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And, um, so one of the things that  they  were pushing in d- in discussing with me is, um,	no
13208	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	w- why are you spending so much time,	no
13209	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	uh, on the, uh,  feature  issue,	no
13210	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	uh, when perhaps if you sort of  deal  with what you were using  before	no
13211	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Uh-huh.	no
13212	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	and then just  broadened  it a bit, instead of just ta- using silence as putative change point also - ?	no
13213	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	So then you've got - you already have the super-structure with Gaussians and H_- you know, simple H_M_Ms and so forth.	no
13214	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Nnn, yeah.	no
13215	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And you - you might -	no
13216	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	So there was a - there was a little bit of a - a -	no
13217	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	a - a difference of  opinion  because I - I thought that it was - it's  interesting  to look at what features are useful.	no
13218	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13219	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	But, uh, on the other hand I saw that the - they had a good point that, uh,	no
13220	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	if we had something that worked for many cases before, maybe starting from there a little bit - Because  ultimately  we're gonna end up	no
13221	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	with some s- su- kind of structure  like  that, where you have some kind of simple H_M_M and you're testing the hypothesis that,	no
13222	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13223	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13224	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	uh, there is a  change.  So -	no
13225	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13226	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	so anyway, I just -  reporting  that. But, uh, uh -	no
13227	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K.	no
13228	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	So. Yeah, why don't we do the speech-nonspeech discussion?	yes
13229	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	So. Yeah, why don't we do the speech-nonspeech discussion?	no
13230	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13231	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Do - I - I hear - you - you didn't -	no
13232	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Speech-nonspeech? O_K.	no
13233	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Uh-huh. Yeah.	no
13234	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Um, so, uh, what we basically did so far was using the mixed file to - to detect s- speech or nonspeech  portions in that.	no
13235	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
13236	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And	no
13237	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	what I did so far is I just used our old Munich system, which is an H_M_M-ba- based system with Gaussian mixtures for s- speech and nonspeech.	no
13238	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And it  was  a system which used only one Gaussian for silence and one Gaussian for speech. And now I added, uh, multi-mixture possibility for -	no
13239	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
13240	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
13241	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	for speech and nonspeech. And I did some	no
13242	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	training on - on one dialogue, which was transcribed	no
13243	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	by -	no
13244	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Jose.	no
13245	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. We - we did a nons- s- speech-nonspeech transcription. Adam, Dave, and I, we did,	no
13246	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	for that dialogue and I trained it on that.	no
13247	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And I did some pre-segmentations for - for Jane. And I'm not sure how good they are or what - what the transcribers say. They -	no
13248	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	they can use it or - ?	no
13249	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Uh, they - they think it's a terrific improvement. And, um, it real- it just makes a - a world of difference.	no
13250	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Hmm.	no
13251	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And, um, y- you also did some- something in  addition  which was, um, for those in which there  was, uh,  quiet  speakers in the mix.	no
13252	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. Uh, yeah. That - that was one - one - one thing,	no
13253	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	uh,	no
13254	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	why I added more mixtures for - for the speech. So I saw that there were	no
13255	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
13256	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	loud - loudly speaking speakers and quietly speaking speakers. And so I did two mixtures, one for the loud speakers and one for the quiet speakers.	no
13257	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And did you  hand-label  who was loud and who was quiet, or did you just - ?	no
13258	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I did that for - for five minutes of one dialogue and that was enough to - to train the system. And so it - it adapts, uh, on -	no
13259	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Right.	no
13260	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13261	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	W-	no
13262	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	What - ?	no
13263	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	while running. So.	no
13264	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Hopefully.	no
13265	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	What kind of, uh, front-end processing did you do?	no
13266	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K.	no
13267	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	It's just our -	no
13268	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	our old Munich, uh, loudness-based spectrum	no
13269	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	on mel scale twenty - twenty critical bands and then loudness.	no
13270	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
13271	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And four additional features, which is energy, loudness, modified loudness, and zero crossing rate.	no
13272	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	So it's twenty-four - twenty-four features.	no
13273	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
13274	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mmm.	no
13275	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And you also provided me with  several  different versions, which I compared.	no
13276	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. Yeah.	no
13277	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And so you change  parameters. What - do you wanna say something about the parameters  that you change?	no
13278	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13279	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	You  can  specify	no
13280	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	the  minimum  length of speech or - and silence portions which you want. And so I did some - some modifications in those parameters, basically changing the minimum -	no
13281	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	minimum  length for s- for silence	no
13282	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	to have, er- to have, um - yeah -	no
13283	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	to have more or less, uh, silence portions in- inserted. So.	no
13284	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Right. So this would work well for,	no
13285	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13286	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	uh,  pauses  and  utterance  boundaries and things like that. But for  overlap  I imagine that doesn't work at all, that you'll have plenty of s- sections that are -	no
13287	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13288	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13289	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13290	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13291	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13292	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13293	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	That's  it. Yeah.	no
13294	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  That's true. But  it - it saves  so  much time - the - the  transcribers just enormous, enormous savings. Fantastic.	no
13295	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13296	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Um -	no
13297	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	But -	no
13298	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yep.	no
13299	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	That's great.	no
13300	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Um, just qu- one quickly, uh, still on the features. So	no
13301	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	you have these twenty-four features. Uh, a lot of  them   are  spectral  features. Is there a - a transformation, uh, like principal components transformation or something? Just -	no
13302	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13303	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	No.	no
13304	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	No. W- w- we - originally we did that	no
13305	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. It was I_S two.	no
13306	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	but we saw, uh, when we used it, uh, f- for our close-talking microphone, which -	no
13307	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	yeah, for our - for our recognizer in Munich -	no
13308	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	we saw that w- it's - it's not - it's not so necessary. It - it works as well f-	no
13309	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K.	no
13310	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	with - with - without, uh, a L_D_A or something.	no
13311	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K. No, I was j-  curious. Yeah, I don't think it's a big deal for this application, but - but - Yeah, it's a -	no
13312	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13313	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
13314	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13315	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Right.	no
13316	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
13317	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K. But then there's  another  thing that also Thilo's involved with, which is, um -	yes
13318	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K. But then there's  another  thing that also Thilo's involved with, which is, um -	no
13319	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K, and - and also Da- Dave  Gelbart.  So there's this - this problem	no
13320	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	of - and w- and - so we had this meeting. Th- the  - also Adam, before the - the - before you went away.	no
13321	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Uh  we, um - regarding the representation  of overlaps, because at  present,	no
13322	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	um, because  of the limitations of	no
13323	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	th- the  interface  we're using, overlaps are, uh, not being  encoded by  the transcribers in as complete  and, uh,	no
13324	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	detailed  a way as it  might  be,  and as might be  desired  -  I  think would be desired in the corpus ultimately.	no
13325	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
13326	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	So we don't have start and end points  at each point where there's an overlap. We just have the - the  overlaps  encoded in a simple bin.	no
13327	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Well, O_K. So   @@  the limits of the  over- of - of the interface are	no
13328	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	such that we were - at this meeting we were entertaining how we might either expand  the - the	no
13329	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	interface or find other tools which already   do  what would be  useful.  Because what would ultimately be,	no
13330	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	um, ideal in my - my view and I think - I mean, I had the sense that it was consensus, is that, um,	no
13331	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	a thorough-going musical score notation would be  the best way to go.	no
13332	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Because  you can have multiple  channels,  there's a single  time-line,  it's very clear, flexible, and all those nice things.	no
13333	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
13334	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K. So, um,	no
13335	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	um, I spoke - I had a meeting with Dave Gelbart on - on - and he had,	no
13336	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	uh, excellent ideas on how  the interface could be  modified to - to  do  this kind of representation.	no
13337	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	But, um, he - in the meantime you were checking into the existence of already,	no
13338	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	um, existing interfaces which might already  have  these properties.  So, do you wanna  say  something about that?	no
13339	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yes. Um,  I	no
13340	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	talked with, uh,	no
13341	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Munich guys from - from Ludwi- Ludwig Maximilians University, who do a lot of transcribing and transliterations.	no
13342	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
13343	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And they basically said they have -	no
13344	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	they have, uh, a tool they developed  themselves	no
13345	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	and they can't give away, uh, f- it's too error-prone, and had - it's not supported, a- a- a- and -	no
13346	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13347	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	But,  um,	no
13348	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Susanne   Bur- Burger, who is at se- C_M_U, he wa- who  was  formally at - in Munich and w- and is now at - with C_M_U,	no
13349	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	she said she has something	no
13350	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	which she uses to do eight channels, uh, trans- transliterations, eight channels simultaneously,	no
13351	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Excuse me.	no
13352	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	but  it's running under Windows.	no
13353	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Under Windows. Mm-hmm.	no
13354	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	So I'm not sure if - if - if we can use it. She said she would give it to us. It wouldn't be a problem.	no
13355	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
13356	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And I've got some - some kind of manual  down in my office.	no
13357	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Well, maybe we should  get  it and if it's good  enough	no
13358	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13359	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	we'll arrange Windows machines to be available.	no
13360	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm. We could - uh, potentially  so. I also wanted to be sure -	no
13361	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	So.	no
13362	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I mean, I've - I've  seen  the - this - this is called Praat, P_R_A_A_T,  which I guess means spee- speech in Dutch or something.	no
13363	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yep.	no
13364	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah, but then I'm not sure  that's the right thing for us.	no
13365	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	But -	no
13366	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	In terms  of it being  Windows  versus - But I'm just wondering, is - ?	no
13367	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13368	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	No, no.  Praat  isn't - Praat's multi-platform.	no
13369	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	No. No, Praat -	no
13370	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. Yeah.	no
13371	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Oh! I  see.  Oh,  I  see. So Praat may not be -	no
13372	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13373	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	"That's not Praat. It's called ""trans- transedit""  I think. The - the, uh - the tool from - from  Susanne."	no
13374	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	It's a different one.	no
13375	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I  see. Oh, I  see.	no
13376	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K. O_K. Alright.	no
13377	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	The other thing, uh, to keep in mind, uh - I mean,	no
13378	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	we've been very concerned to get all this rolling so that we would actually have data,	no
13379	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mmm, yeah.	no
13380	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	but, um, I think our outside sponsor  is   actually  gonna kick in and ultimately that path will be smoothed out. So I don't know	no
13381	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
13382	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	if we have a long-term need to do lots and lots of transcribing. I think we had a very quick need to get something out	no
13383	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	and we'd like to be able to do  some  later because just it's inter- it's interesting.	no
13384	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	But as far a- you know, uh, with - with any luck we'll be able to wind down the larger project.	no
13385	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Oh.	no
13386	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	But you s-	no
13387	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	What our  decision  was is that  we'll go ahead with what we have with a  not  very fine time scale on the overlaps.	no
13388	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13389	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Right.	no
13390	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13391	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And - and do what we can later  to clean that up if we need to.	no
13392	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
13393	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Right.	no
13394	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And - and I was just thinking that, um,	no
13395	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	if it were  possible  to bring that in, like,	no
13396	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	you know, this week,  then  when they're encoding the overlaps	no
13397	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Uh-huh.	no
13398	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	it would be nice for them to be able to specify	no
13399	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	when - you know, the start points and end points of overlaps.	no
13400	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	uh  Th- they're  making really quick progress.	no
13401	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13402	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	That's great.	no
13403	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And, um, so my -  my  goal was - w- m-  my  charge was to get eleven hours by the end of the month. And it'll be - I'm - I'm - I'm clear that we'll be able to do that.	no
13404	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	That's great. Yeah.	no
13405	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And did you, uh,	no
13406	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	forward Morgan Brian's  thing?	no
13407	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I sent  it to,  um - who did I send that to? I sent it to a list and I thought  I sent it to  the  -	no
13408	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	e- to the local list. You saw that?	no
13409	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Meeting Recorder.	no
13410	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Oh, you did? O_K. So you probably did get that.	no
13411	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	So Brian  did  tell  me that  in fact what  you  said, that,  uh - that  our -	no
13412	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	that they are  making progress and that he's going - that  they're  going - he's gonna  check  the f- the output of the  first  transcription and -	no
13413	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I mean, basically it's - it's all the difference in the world. I mean, basically he's - he's  on  it now.	no
13414	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	and -	no
13415	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13416	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Oh, that's - this is a new development.  O_K.	no
13417	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	So - so - so this is - so i- it'll happen.	no
13418	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Super. Super. O_K. Great.	no
13419	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. I mean, basically it's just saying that one of our - one of our best people is on it,	no
13420	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	you know, who just doesn't happen to be  here  anymore. Someone else pays him. So -  So.	no
13421	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13422	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Isn't that great?	no
13423	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	But about the need for transcription, I mean, don't we - didn't we previously	no
13424	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13425	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	decide that the  I_B_M  transcripts would have to be  checked anyway and possibly augmented?	no
13426	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yes. That's true.	no
13427	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
13428	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	So, I think having a good  tool  is worth something no matter  what.	no
13429	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. S- O_K. That's - that's a good point.	no
13430	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah, and Dave Gelbart did volunteer, and since he's not here, I'll repeat it -	no
13431	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Good.	no
13432	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	to at least modify Transcriber, which, if we don't have something else that works, I think that's a pretty good way of going.	no
13433	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mmm.	no
13434	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
13435	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And we discussed on some methods to do it. My approach originally, and I've already hacked on it a little  bit  -	no
13436	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	it was too slow because I was trying to display all the waveforms. But he pointed out that you don't really  have  to. I think that's a good point.	no
13437	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
13438	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
13439	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Hmm.	no
13440	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	That if you just display the  mix  waveform	no
13441	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	and then have a user interface for editing the different channels, that's perfectly sufficient.	no
13442	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah,  exactly.  And just keep those  things separate. And - and, um, Dan Ellis's hack already allows them to be   able  to display	no
13443	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	different  waveforms to clarify overlaps and things, so that's already -	no
13444	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	No. They can only display one, but they can listen to different ones.	no
13445	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Oh, yes,  but  -	no
13446	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Well,  uh, yes, but  what I mean is  that, uh, from the  transcriber's   perspective, uh,	no
13447	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	those  two functions are separate. And Dan Ellis's hack handles the,	no
13448	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	um, choice  - the ability to choose different waveforms	no
13449	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	from moment to moment.	no
13450	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	But only to  listen  to, not to  look  at.	no
13451	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Um -	no
13452	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13453	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	The waveform you're looking at doesn't change.	no
13454	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13455	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	That's true. Yeah, but  that's - that's O_K, cuz they're - they're,	no
13456	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13457	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	you know, they're focused on the ear anyway. And then - and then	no
13458	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Right.	no
13459	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Hmm.	no
13460	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	the hack to	no
13461	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	preserve the  overlaps   better would be one which creates different  output  files for each channel,	no
13462	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	which  then   would  also  serve Liz's request  of having,	no
13463	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Right.	no
13464	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	you know, a single channel, separable, uh, cleanly,	no
13465	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
13466	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	easily separable, uh, transcript tied to a single channel, uh, audio.	no
13467	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
13468	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Have, uh, folks from NIST been in contact with you?	no
13469	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Not directly. I'm trying to think if - if I could have gotten it over a list.  I don't - I don't  think  so.	no
13470	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K.	no
13471	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K. Well, holidays may have interrupted things, cuz in - in - in - They	no
13472	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	seem to want to  get absolutely clear on standards for - transcription standards and so forth with - with us.	no
13473	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Oh! This was from before  December.  Yeah.	no
13474	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Right. Because they're - they're presumably going to start recording next month.	no
13475	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K. O_K.	no
13476	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Oh, we should definitely get  with  them then, and	no
13477	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	So.	no
13478	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	agree upon a  format.	no
13479	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Though I don't remember  email  on that. So was I not in the loop on that?	no
13480	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Um. Yeah, I don't think I  mailed  anybody. I just think I told them to contact Jane - that, uh, if they had a -	no
13481	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Oh, O_K.	no
13482	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	That's right.	no
13483	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	if, uh - that - that, uh, as the point person on it. But -	no
13484	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah, I think that's right. Just, uh -	no
13485	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	So, yeah. Maybe I'll, uh,	no
13486	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	ping them a little bit about it to	no
13487	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K.	no
13488	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I'm keeping the conventions  absolutely  as simple  as possible.	no
13489	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	get that straight.	no
13490	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. So is it - cuz with any luck there'll actually be a - a - there'll be collections at Columbia, collections at - at U_W -	no
13491	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I mean Dan - Dan is very interested in doing some other things,	no
13492	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Right.	no
13493	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. Yeah.	no
13494	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Well, I think it's important both	no
13495	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	and collections at NIST. So -	no
13496	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	for the notation and the machine representation to be the same.	no
13497	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13498	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	So.	no
13499	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	N- there was also this,  uh, email from Dan regarding the  speech-non- nonspeech segmentation thing.	no
13500	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yep.	no
13501	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13502	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13503	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I don't know if, uh,	no
13504	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	uh, we wanna, uh - and Dan Gel- and Dave Gelbart is interested in  pursuing  the aspect  of using amplitude  as a -	no
13505	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	a - a - as a basis for the separation.	no
13506	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Oh, yeah. He was talking - he was talking - I mean, uh, we - he had -	no
13507	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	@@   Cross-correlation.	no
13508	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Cross-	no
13509	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah, cross-correlation. I had mentioned this a couple times before, the c- the commercial devices that do, uh,	no
13510	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Cross-	no
13511	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Uh-huh.	no
13512	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	uh, voice, uh - you know, active miking,	no
13513	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	basically  look  at the amp- at the energy at each of the mikes. And - and you basically compare the energy here to	no
13514	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	some function of  all  of the mikes. So,	no
13515	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13516	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K.	no
13517	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13518	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	by doing that, you know, rather than setting any, uh, absolute threshold, you actually can do pretty good, uh, selection of who - who's talking.	no
13519	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Uh -	no
13520	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K.	no
13521	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And those - those systems work very  well,  by the way, I mean, so people use them in	no
13522	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	panel discussions and so forth with sound reinforcement differing in - in sort of, uh -	no
13523	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Uh-huh.	no
13524	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	and, uh, those - if -	no
13525	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Boy, the guy I knew who built  them,   built  them   like twenty -	no
13526	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	twenty years ago, so they're -  it's - the - the techniques work pretty well.	no
13527	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Hmm.	no
13528	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Fantastic.	no
13529	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	So.	no
13530	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Cuz there is one thing that we don't have right now and that is the automatic, um,	no
13531	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	channel  identifier.	no
13532	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
13533	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	That - that, you know, that would g- help in terms of encoding of  overlaps.   The - the transcribers would have less,	no
13534	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	uh, disentangling to do  if that were available.	no
13535	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. So I think, you know, basically you can	no
13536	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	But.	no
13537	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	look at some - p- you have to play around a little bit, uh, to figure out what the right statistic is, but you compare each microphone to some statistic based on the -	no
13538	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
13539	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
13540	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	on the overall -	no
13541	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13542	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
13543	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K.	no
13544	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Uh, and we also have these - we have the advantage of having  distant mikes too. So that, you cou- yo-	no
13545	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah, although the - the -	no
13546	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	using the close-talking I think would be much better. Wouldn't it?	no
13547	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Um.	no
13548	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13549	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I - I don't know. I just - it'd be -	no
13550	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13551	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	If I was actually working on it, I'd sit there and - and play around with it, and - and get a feeling for it. I mean, the - the - the, uh - But,	no
13552	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	uh, you certainly wanna use the close-talking, as a - at  least.	no
13553	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Right.	no
13554	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I don't know if the other would - would add some other helpful dimension or not.	no
13555	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
13556	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
13557	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K. What - what are the different, uh, classes to - to code, uh, the - the overlap, you will use?	no
13558	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Um, to code d- so  types  of overlap?	no
13559	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	What you - you - Yeah.	no
13560	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Um, so  at a meeting that  wasn't  transcribed, we worked up a - a typology.	no
13561	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And, um -	no
13562	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13563	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Look like, uh, you t- you explaining in the blackboard? The - ? Yeah? Yeah.	no
13564	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yes, exactly. That hasn't changed. So it  i- the - it's basically a two-tiered structure	no
13565	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	where the first one is  whether   the person who's interrupted  continues  or not. And then	no
13566	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	below that there're  subcategories, uh, that have more to do with,  you know, is it,	no
13567	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
13568	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	uh, simply  backchannel  or is  it, um, someone	no
13569	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	completing someone else's thought,  or is it someone in- introducing a new thought.	no
13570	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Right.	no
13571	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Huh.	no
13572	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And I  hope	no
13573	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	that if we do a forced alignment with the close-talking mike, that will be enough to recover	no
13574	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13575	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	at least  some  of the time	no
13576	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	the time information of when the overlap occurred.	no
13577	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm. Well,  one  would  -	no
13578	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13579	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	We hope.	no
13580	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. Who knows?	no
13581	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	That'd be - that'd be  nice.  I mean,	no
13582	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I - I - I - I've -	no
13583	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	So who's gonna do that? Who's gonna do forced alignment?	no
13584	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Well, u- uh, I_B_M was  going  to. Um -	no
13585	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Oh, O_K.	no
13586	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Oh.	no
13587	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	and I  imagine  they still plan to but - but, you know, I haven't spoken with them about that recently.	no
13588	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K.	no
13589	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Uh-huh.	no
13590	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Well, uh, my suggestion now is - is on all of these things to, uh, contact Brian.	no
13591	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	This is  wonderful   to have a direct contact like that.	no
13592	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K. I'll do that.	no
13593	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13594	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13595	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	uh  Well, th- lemme ask  you  this.  It occurs to me -	no
13596	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13597	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	one of my transcribers t-  told  me today that she'll  be finished with  one  meeting,	no
13598	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
13599	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	um, by - well, she said tomorrow  but then she said  - you know, but  - the, you know - let's - let's just, uh, say	no
13600	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
13601	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	maybe the day after just to be s- on the safe side.	no
13602	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I could send Brian the,  um -	no
13603	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	the   transcript.  I know these  are -	no
13604	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	er, uh, I could send him that  if  it would be possible,  or a good idea or not, to  try  to do a s- forced alignment on what we're -	no
13605	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	on the way we're encoding overlaps now.	no
13606	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Well, just talk to him about it.	no
13607	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yep.	no
13608	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Good.	no
13609	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I mean, you know, basically he's - he just studies, he's a colleague, a friend, and,	no
13610	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah! Super. Super.	no
13611	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	uh, they - and - and, you know, the - the organization always  did  wanna help us. It was just a question of getting, you know, the right people connected in, who had the time. So,	no
13612	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah, yeah.	no
13613	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Right.	no
13614	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	um, eh -	no
13615	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Is he on the mailing list?	no
13616	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	The Meeting Recorder mailing li- ? We should add him.	no
13617	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Oh!	no
13618	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13619	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. I - I - I don't  know  for sure.	no
13620	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Did something  happen,  Morgan, that he got put  on  this, or was he  already  on it, or - ?	no
13621	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Add him.	no
13622	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	No, I, eh, eh, p-	no
13623	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	It - it oc- I - h- it's -	no
13624	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah, something happened. I don't know what. But he's on it now.	no
13625	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	He asked for more work.	no
13626	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Huh.	no
13627	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	That would be  like - that'd be like him. He's great.	no
13628	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Right.	yes
13629	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Right.	no
13630	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	So, uh,	no
13631	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	where are we? Maybe, uh, uh,	no
13632	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	brief -	no
13633	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Well, let's - why don't we talk about microphone issues? That was - that was a -	no
13634	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. That'd be  great.	no
13635	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Um,	no
13636	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	so  one  thing is that I  did  look on  Sony's  for a  replacement  for the  mikes  -	no
13637	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	for the head m- head-worn ones cuz they're so uncomfortable.	no
13638	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	@@	no
13639	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	But I think I need someone who knows more about mikes than  I  do, because I couldn't find a single other model that	no
13640	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	seemed like it would fit the connector,	no
13641	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	which seems  really   unlikely  to me.	no
13642	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Does anyone, like,	no
13643	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	know stores or	no
13644	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	know about mikes who - who would know the right questions to ask?	no
13645	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Oh, I  probably  would. I mean, my knowledge is twenty years out of date but some of it's still the same. So -	no
13646	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
13647	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Uh, so maybe we c- we can take a look at that.	no
13648	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	You couldn't - you couldn't find the right connector to go into  these  things?	no
13649	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yep.	no
13650	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Huh!	no
13651	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	When I  looked,  i- they listed  one  microphone and that's  it	no
13652	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	as having that type of connector. But my  guess	no
13653	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	is that Sony maybe uses a different  number  for their connector than everyone else does.	no
13654	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And - and so -	no
13655	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
13656	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Well, let's look at it together and -	no
13657	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	it seems - it seems really unlikely to me that there's only one.	no
13658	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And there's no  adaptor  for it?	no
13659	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Seems like there'd be a - O_K.	no
13660	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13661	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	As I said, who knows?	no
13662	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
13663	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Who - who are we buying these from? That'd be a -	no
13664	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Um,	no
13665	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I have it downstairs. I don't remember off the top of my head.	no
13666	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. O_K.	no
13667	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. We - we can try and look at that together.	no
13668	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And then, uh -	no
13669	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	just in terms of  how  you wear them -	no
13670	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I mean, I had thought about this before. I mean, when - when - when you use a product like DragonDictate, they have a very extensive description about how to wear the microphone and so on.	no
13671	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Oh.	no
13672	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	But  I  felt that	no
13673	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	in a  real  situation we were very  seldom  gonna get people to really do it and maybe it wasn't worth concentrating on.	no
13674	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	But -	no
13675	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Well, I think that that's - that's a good	no
13676	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	back-off position. That's what I was saying  earlier, th- that, you know, we  are  gonna get some	no
13677	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	recordings that are  imperfect  and, hey, that's  life.  But I - I think that it - it doesn't  hurt,	no
13678	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	uh, the naturalness of the situation	no
13679	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	to try to have people  wear the microphones properly, if possible, because,	no
13680	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
13681	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	um, the  natural  situation is  really  what we have with the microphones on the  table.  I mean, I think,	no
13682	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Oh. That's true.	no
13683	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	you know, in the target applications that we're talking about, people aren't gonna be wearing head-mounted mikes anyway. So this is just for u- these head-mounted mikes are just for use with research.	no
13684	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13685	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13686	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
13687	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And, uh, it's gonna make -	no
13688	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.  @@	no
13689	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	You know, if - if An- Andreas plays around with language modeling, he's  not  gonna be m- wanna be messed up by people breathing into the microphone. So it's - it's, uh, uh -	no
13690	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Right.	no
13691	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Well, I'll dig through the documentation to DragonDictate and ste- s- see if they still have the little  form.	no
13692	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	But it does  happen.  Right? I mean, and any -	no
13693	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13694	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	It's interesting, uh,	no
13695	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I talked to some I_B_M guys, uh, last January, I think, I was there. And -	no
13696	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	so people who were working on the - on their ViaVoice	no
13697	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13698	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	dictation product.	no
13699	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And they said,	no
13700	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	uh, the breathing is really a - a terrible problem  for them,	no
13701	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	to - to not recognize breathing as speech.	no
13702	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Wow.	no
13703	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	So, anything to reduce breathing is -	no
13704	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13705	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Well, that's the -	no
13706	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	is - is a good thing.	no
13707	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	It seemed to me when I was using Dragon	no
13708	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
13709	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	that it was really microphone placement helped an - in, uh - an enormous amount. So you want it	no
13710	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Right.	no
13711	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	enough to the side so that when you exhale through your  nose,  it doesn't - the wind doesn't hit the mike.	no
13712	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
13713	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And then, uh -	no
13714	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Everyone's adjusting their microphones, of course.	no
13715	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And then just  close  enough so that you get good volume. So you know, wearing it right about here	no
13716	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13717	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13718	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	seems to be about the right way to do it.	no
13719	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Is  -  Uh-huh.	no
13720	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I remember when I was - when I - I - I - I used, uh,	no
13721	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	um,	no
13722	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	a prominent laboratory's, uh, uh, speech recognizer about,  uh -	no
13723	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	This was,  boy,  this was a  while  ago, this was about twelve -	no
13724	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	twelve years ago or something.	no
13725	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And, um,	no
13726	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	they were - they were  perturbed  with me because I was breathing  in  instead of breathing  out.  And they had  models  for - they -	no
13727	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	they had Markov models for br- breathing  out  but they didn't have  them   for breathing  in.	no
13728	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Uh -	no
13729	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13730	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	That's interesting.	no
13731	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Well, what  I  wondered is whether it's possible to have -	no
13732	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	to maybe use the  display  at the  beginning  to be able to - to  judge  how - how correctly - I mean, have someone do some routine  whatever,	no
13733	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13734	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	and - and then see if when they're breathing it's  showing.  I don't know if the - if it's -	no
13735	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I -	no
13736	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I mean, when - when it's  on,  you can see it. You can definitely see it. Absolutely. Absolutely.	no
13737	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Can you see the breathing? Cuz I -	no
13738	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Oh.	no
13739	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13740	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I-	no
13741	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And so, you know, I've - I've sat here and  watched	no
13742	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	sometimes the breathing,  and the bar going up and down, and I'm thinking,	no
13743	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I could  say  something, but	no
13744	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I mean, I think -	no
13745	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I don't want to make people self-conscious. Stop breathing!	no
13746	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	It - it's going to be imperfect. You're not gonna get it perfect.	no
13747	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.  Uh-huh.	no
13748	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And  you can do some, uh, you know, first-order thing about it, which is to have people move it,	no
13749	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	uh, uh, a- away from being just directly in front of the middle	no
13750	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13751	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Good.	no
13752	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	but not too far away.	no
13753	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah, i-	no
13754	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And then, you know, I think there's not much - Because you can't al- you know, interfere w-	no
13755	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	you can't fine tune the meeting  that  much, I think. It's sort of -	no
13756	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Right.	no
13757	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13758	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	That's true. It just seems like i- if something l- simple like that can be tweaked	no
13759	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	and the quality goes, you know, uh, dramatically	no
13760	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yep.	no
13761	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	up, then it might be worth  doing.	no
13762	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And then also - the position of the mike also. If it's more directly, you'll get better volume.	no
13763	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13764	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	So - so, like, yours is pretty far  down   below your mouth. Yeah.	no
13765	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	But - Mm-hmm.	no
13766	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13767	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	My - my feedback from the transcribers is he is  always  close to crystal clear and - and just fan- fantastic to -	no
13768	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13769	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mmm, yeah.	no
13770	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
13771	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I don't know why  that  is.	no
13772	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Well, I mean, you - Yeah, of course. You're - you're also -	no
13773	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	uh, your  volume  is - is greater. But - but  still,  I mean, they - they say -	no
13774	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I've been eating a lot.	no
13775	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Uh.	no
13776	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I- it makes their - their job extremely easy. Yeah.	no
13777	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And then there's mass.	no
13778	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Anyway.	no
13779	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
13780	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I could say something about - about the - Well, I don't know what you wanna do. Yeah.	no
13781	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	About what?	no
13782	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	About the transcribers or anything or - ? I don't know.	no
13783	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Well, the other - why don't we do that?	yes
13784	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	About the transcribers or anything or - ? I don't know.	no
13785	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Well, the other - why don't we do that?	no
13786	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	But, uh, just to - to, um -	no
13787	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	One more remark, uh, concerning the S_R_I recognizer. Um.	no
13788	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	It is useful to transcribe and then ultimately train models for things like breath, and also laughter is very, very frequent and important to -	no
13789	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
13790	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	to model.	no
13791	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	So,	no
13792	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	So,	no
13793	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	if you can in your transcripts mark -	no
13794	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	mark  them?	no
13795	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	mark very audible breaths and laughter especially, um - O_K.	no
13796	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mmm.	no
13797	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	"They  are.  They're putting - Eh, so in curly brackets they put ""inhale"" or ""breath""."	no
13798	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
13799	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	"It - they - and then in curly brackets they say ""laughter"". Now they're -"	no
13800	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Oh, great.	no
13801	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	they're not being  awfully  precise,  uh, m- So they're two types of laughter that are not being distinguished. One is	no
13802	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
13803	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	when sometimes s- someone will start laughing when they're in the middle of a sentence.	no
13804	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
13805	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And - and then the other one is when they finish the sentence and then they laugh.	no
13806	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	So, um, I - I did s- I did some double checking to look through - I mean,  you'd need to have extra	no
13807	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	hhh	no
13808	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	e- extra complications, like time tags indicating the beginning and ending of -	no
13809	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	"of the  laughing  through the  utterance.  And that - and what they're doing is in both cases just saying ""curly brackets  laughing""   a- after the unit."	no
13810	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	It's not so - I don't think it's, um -	no
13811	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	As - as long as there  is  an indication that there  was  laughter somewhere between  two words	no
13812	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13813	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Good.	no
13814	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Oh!	no
13815	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K.	no
13816	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I think that's  sufficient,  because	no
13817	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Against - they could do forced alignment.	no
13818	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	actually the recognition of laughter once you kn- um -	no
13819	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13820	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	you know, is pretty  good.  So as long as you can stick a -	no
13821	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Oh, I didn't know that.	no
13822	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	you know, a t- a  tag  in there that -	no
13823	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	that indicates that there  was  laughter,	no
13824	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K.	no
13825	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	that would probably be, uh, sufficient to train models.	no
13826	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Then -	no
13827	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	That would be a  really  interesting  prosodic feature, when -	no
13828	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And let me ask y- and I gotta ask you one thing about that. So, um,	no
13829	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13830	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Hmm.	no
13831	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	if they laugh between two words, you - you'd get it	no
13832	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
13833	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	in between the two words. But if they laugh across three or  four  words you - you get it after those four words. Does that matter?	no
13834	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Right.	no
13835	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13836	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Well, the thing that you - is hard to deal with is whe-	no
13837	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	when they speak while laughing.	no
13838	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13839	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Um, and that's, uh - I don't	no
13840	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	think that we can do very well with that. So -	no
13841	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Right.	no
13842	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13843	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	But, um, that's not as frequent as just laughing between	no
13844	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K.	no
13845	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	speaking, so -	no
13846	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Uh  is it?	no
13847	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	So are - do you treat breath and laughter as	no
13848	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I think he's right. Yeah.	no
13849	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Huh.	no
13850	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I - I think it's frequent in - in the meeting.	no
13851	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	phonetically,  or as  word  models, or what?	no
13852	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	We tried both. Uh, currently,	no
13853	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	um, we use special words.	no
13854	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	There was a -	no
13855	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	there's actually a word for -	no
13856	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	uh, it's not just breathing but all kinds of mouth - uh, mouth - mouth stuff.	no
13857	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm. Mouth stuff?	no
13858	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And then laughter is a - is a special word.	no
13859	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	How would we do that with the hybrid system?	no
13860	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	@@	no
13861	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Same thing.	no
13862	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Same thing?	no
13863	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	So train a phone  in the neural net?	no
13864	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13865	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. You ha- Oh. And each of these words has a dedicated phone.	no
13866	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	No -	no
13867	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Oh, it does?	no
13868	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	So the - so the - the mouth noise, uh,  word  has just a single phone,	no
13869	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	um, that is for  that.	no
13870	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Right. So in the hybrid system we could train the net with	no
13871	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13872	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	a laughter phone and a breath sound phone.	no
13873	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. Yeah.	no
13874	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I mean, it's - it's - it's always the same thing. Right? I mean, you could - you could say well, let -	no
13875	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
13876	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	@@	no
13877	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	we  now  think that laughter should have three sub- sub-	no
13878	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	sub-units in the - the three states, uh - different states. And then you would have three -  I mean, you know, eh, eh, it's u-	no
13879	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13880	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And the - the pronun- the pronunciations - the pronunciations are l- are somewhat non-standard. They actually are -	no
13881	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Do whatever you want.  Yeah.	no
13882	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13883	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah, yeah.	no
13884	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	No.	no
13885	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	uh, it's just a single,	no
13886	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	s- uh, you know, a single  phone  in the pronunciation, but it has a self-loop on it, so it can -	no
13887	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	To  go on forever?	no
13888	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	r- can go on forever.	no
13889	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And how do you handle it in the language model?	no
13890	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	It's just a - it's just a word. We train it like any other word. Yeah.	no
13891	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	It's just a word in the language model. Cool.	no
13892	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	We also tried,	no
13893	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	um, absorbing these - uh, both laughter and -	no
13894	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	and actually also noise, and, um -	no
13895	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Sorry to interrupt.	no
13896	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13897	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Is -	no
13898	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	If you want, I got it.	no
13899	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Andreas.	no
13900	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yes.	no
13901	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	The  copies  are ready .	no
13902	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K.	no
13903	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Anyway.  We  also  tried absorbing that into the  pause  model - I mean, the - the - the model that -	no
13904	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
13905	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	that matches the stuff between words.	no
13906	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And, um,	no
13907	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	it didn't work as well. So.	no
13908	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Huh. O_K.	no
13909	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
13910	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Can you hand me your digit form?	no
13911	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Sorry.	no
13912	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I just wanna mark that you did  not  read digits.	no
13913	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K.	no
13914	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Say hi for me.	no
13915	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Good.	no
13916	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	You - you did get me to thinking about - I - I'm not really sure  which  is more frequent, whether	no
13917	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	f- f- laughing - I think it may be an individual thing. Some people are more prone to laughing when they're speaking.	no
13918	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13919	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. I think -	no
13920	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I was noticing that with Dan in the one that we, uh -	no
13921	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	But I can't -	no
13922	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13923	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	we hand tran- hand-segmented, that - th- he has these little  chuckles  as he talks.	no
13924	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I'm sure it's very individual. And - and -	no
13925	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. O_K.	no
13926	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	one thing that c- that we're  not  doing, of course, is we're not claiming to, uh, get - be getting a representation of mankind	no
13927	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	in these recordings. We have  this very, very tiny sample of - of -	no
13928	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13929	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13930	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13931	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Speech researchers?	no
13932	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Uh, yeah. And -  Yeah, r- right.  So, uh, who knows.	no
13933	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Speech research.	no
13934	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Uh -	no
13935	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. Why don- why don't we just - since we're on this vein, why don't we just continue with, uh, what you were gonna say about the transcriptions and - ?	yes
13936	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. Why don- why don't we just - since we're on this vein, why don't we just continue with, uh, what you were gonna say about the transcriptions and - ?	no
13937	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K.	no
13938	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Um, um, the - I - I'm really very for- I'm  extremely  fortunate with the people who, uh, applied and who are  transcribing  for us. They	no
13939	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	are, um, um,  uh   really  perceptive and very, um - and I'm not just saying that cuz they might be hearing this.	no
13940	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Cuz they're gonna be transcribing it in a few days.	no
13941	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	No, they're super. They're - the- they - very quick.	no
13942	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K. Turn the mikes off and let's talk.	no
13943	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah, I know. I am - I'm serious.  They're just super.	no
13944	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	So I, um,	no
13945	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	e- you know, I - I brought  them   in and, um, trained  them   in pairs because I think people can	no
13946	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	raise questions - you know, i- i- the- they think about different things and they think of different -  and um,	no
13947	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	That's a good idea.	no
13948	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I trained them to, uh,	no
13949	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	f- on about a minute or two of the one that was already  transcribed.  This also gives me a sense of -	no
13950	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	You know, I can - I can use that  later,  with reference to inter-coder reliability kind of issues.	no
13951	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	But the main thing was to get them  used  to the  conventions  and,	no
13952	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	you know, the idea of the - th- th- the size of the unit versus how long it takes to play it back so these - th- sort of calibration issues.	no
13953	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And then, um, I just set  them   loose and they're -	no
13954	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	they all have e- a- already  background  in using computers. They're, um - they're  trained  in linguistics. They got -	no
13955	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Good.	no
13956	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Uh-huh.	no
13957	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Oh, no. Is that good or bad?	no
13958	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	"Well, they- they're very perce- they'll - So one of them said ""well, you know, he really said "" n "", not really "" and "","	no
13959	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. Yeah.	no
13960	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	"so what  - what should I do with that?"" And I said, ""well for our purposes,"	no
13961	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13962	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13963	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	"I  do  have a  convention.  If it's an - a noncanonical p-""  That  one, I think we - you know, with Eric's work, I sort of figure we - we can just treat that as a variant."	no
13964	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K.	no
13965	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	But I told them if - if there's an obvious  speech  error,	no
13966	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yes.	no
13967	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	"uh, like I said in one thing, and I gave my - my example,  like  I said, ""microfon""  in- instead of ""microphone""."	no
13968	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	"Didn't bother - I knew it when I said it. I remember s- thinking ""oh, that's not"	no
13969	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	"correctly pronounced"".  But it - but I thought  it's not worth  fixing  cuz often when you're  speaking  everybody knows what - what you mean."	no
13970	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	You'll self-repair.  Yeah.	no
13971	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13972	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	But I have a convention that if it's obviously a noncanonical pronunciation - a speech error with - you know, wi-	no
13973	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	within the realm of resolution that you can tell in this native English -	no
13974	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	"American English speaker, you know that I didn't mean to say ""microfon."""	no
13975	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	"Then you'd put a little tick at the beginning of the word, and that just signals that, um, this is not standard, and then in curly brackets ""pron  error""."	no
13976	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
13977	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And, um, and other than  that,  it's w- word level. But, you know, the fact that they  noticed,	no
13978	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	"you know, the "" nnn "". ""He said "" nnn "", not "" and "". What shall I  do  with that?"" I mean, they're very perceptive."	no
13979	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And - and s- several of them are trained in I_P_A.  C- they really  could  do phonetic transcription if - if we wanted  them   to.	no
13980	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
13981	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Right. Well -	no
13982	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	But -	no
13983	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Hmm. Where were they when  we needed them?	no
13984	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Well, you know, it might be something we'd wanna do with some, uh, s- small subset  of the whole thing.	no
13985	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I think -	no
13986	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	We certainly wouldn't wanna do it with everything.	no
13987	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And I'm also thinking these people are a  terrific  pool. I mean, if, uh - so I - I told them that, um, we don't know if this will continue past the end of the month and I also -	no
13988	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Uh-huh.	no
13989	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	m- I	no
13990	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	think they know that the data p- source is  limited  and I may not be able to keep  them   employed till the end of the month even, although I  hope  to.	no
13991	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	The other thing we could do, actually, uh, is,	no
13992	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And -	no
13993	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	uh, use them for	no
13994	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	a more detailed analysis of the  overlaps.	no
13995	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Oh, that'd be so super. They would be so - s- so terrific.	no
13996	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Right?	no
13997	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I mean, this was something	no
13998	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	that we were talking about. We  could  get a very detailed overlap if they were willing to transcribe each meeting four or five times.	no
13999	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Right? One for each participant.	no
14000	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	So they could by  hand  -	no
14001	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Well, that's one way to do it. But I've been saying the other thing is  just  go through it for the overlaps. Right?	no
14002	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
14003	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
14004	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm, that's right. And with the right in- interface -	no
14005	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Given that y- and - and do - so instead of doing phonetic, uh, uh, transcription for the whole thing, which	no
14006	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
14007	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	we know from the - Steve's experience with the Switchboard transcription is, you know,  very,  very time-consuming. And -	no
14008	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	and you know, it took them I don't know how many months to do - to get four  hours.  And so	no
14009	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	that hasn't been  really  our focus.	no
14010	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Uh, we can  consider  it. But, I mean, the other thing is since we've been spending so much time thinking about overlaps is - is maybe get a much more detailed	no
14011	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	analysis of the overlaps.	no
14012	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
14013	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
14014	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	But anyway, I'm - I'm open to c- our consideration.	no
14015	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	That'd be great.	no
14016	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I - I don't wanna say that by fiat. I'm open to every consideration of	no
14017	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Hmm.	no
14018	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
14019	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	what are some other kinds of detailed analysis that would be most useful. And, uh, uh,	no
14020	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
14021	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Hmm.	no
14022	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I - I - I think	no
14023	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	this   year  we - we actually, uh, can do it.	no
14024	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Oh, wonderful.	no
14025	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	It's a - we have - we have - due to	no
14026	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	@@	no
14027	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	variations  in funding we have - we seem to be doing, uh,  very  well on m- money for this - this year, and	no
14028	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	next year we may have - have much less. So I don't wanna  hire  a -	no
14029	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Is - you mean two thousand one?	no
14030	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Calendar year or - ?	no
14031	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Uh, I mean, calendar year two thousand one.	no
14032	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K.	no
14033	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. So it's - uh, it's - we don't wanna  hire  a bunch of people, a long-term staff, because	no
14034	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Full-time. Yeah.	no
14035	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm. Yeah.	no
14036	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	the - the funding that we've gotten is sort of a big chunk for this  year.  But	no
14037	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	having  temporary people doing some specific thing that we need is actually a perfect match to that kind of, uh, funding. So.	no
14038	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Wonderful.	no
14039	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And then school will start in - in the sixt- on the sixteenth. Some of them will have to cut back their hours at that point.  But -	no
14040	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
14041	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
14042	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Are they working full-time now, or - ?	no
14043	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Some of them  are.  Yeah.	no
14044	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Wow.	no
14045	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Well, why do- I wouldn't say forty-hour weeks. No. But what I mean is -	no
14046	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Oh, I shouldn't say it that way because  that does sound like forty-hour weeks. No.	no
14047	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I th- I - I would say they're probably  - they don't have o- they don't have other things that are taking away their  time.	no
14048	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I don't see  how  someone could do forty hours a week on transcription.	no
14049	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Hmm.	no
14050	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	But  it's - you can't.	no
14051	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. Yeah.	no
14052	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	No. You're right. It's - i- it would be too taxing. But, um, they're putting  in a lot of -	no
14053	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
14054	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And - and I checked  them   over. I - I - I haven't checked  them   all, but  just spot-checking. They're fantastic.	no
14055	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I -	no
14056	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I remember when we were transcribing BeRP, uh, uh,	no
14057	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I think it would be -	no
14058	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	uh, Ron Kay, uh, volunteered to - to do some of that. And, he was - the first - first stuff he did was transcribing Chuck.	no
14059	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	"And he's saying ""You - you know, I always thought Chuck spoke really  well. """	no
14060	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. Yeah.	no
14061	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Well, you know, and I  also  thought, y- Liz has this, eh, you know, and I do  also,  this - this interest in the  types  of overlaps that are involved. These people would be	no
14062	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	great choices for doing coding of that type if we wanted, or	no
14063	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	We'd have to mark  them.	no
14064	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
14065	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	whatever. So, um.	no
14066	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
14067	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
14068	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I think it would also be interesting to have, uh,	no
14069	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	a couple of the meetings have more than one transcriber do,	no
14070	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
14071	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	cuz I'm curious about inter-annotator agreement.	no
14072	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
14073	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K.	no
14074	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. Th- that'd be -	no
14075	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
14076	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I think that's a - a good idea. You know, there's also, the e- In  my  mind,	no
14077	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I think A- An- Andreas was  leading to this topic,  the idea that, um,	no
14078	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	we haven't yet  seen  the - the type of transcript that we get from I_B_M, and it may just be,	no
14079	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	you know,  pristine.  But on the other hand, given the lesser interface - Cuz this is, you know - we've got a good interface, we've got	no
14080	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	great headphones, m- um -	no
14081	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	It could be that they will  uh  - theirs will end up being a kind of fir- first pass or something.	no
14082	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Something like that.	no
14083	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Maybe an  elaborate  one, cuz  again  they probably  are  gonna do these  alignments,  which will also	no
14084	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	That's - that's true. Al- although you have to s- Don't you have to start with a close enough approximation  of the -	no
14085	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	clear things up.	no
14086	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	of the verbal part  to be able to - ?	no
14087	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Well, tha- that's - that's debatable. Right? I mean, so the - so the argument is that if your statistical system is good	no
14088	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K.	no
14089	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	it will in fact, uh, clean things up. Right? So it- it's got its own objective criterion.	no
14090	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K.	no
14091	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
14092	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And, uh, so in  principle  you could start up with something that was kind of rough -	no
14093	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I mean, to give an example of, um, something we used to do, uh, at one point, uh, back - back when Chuck was here in early times, is we would take,	no
14094	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	um,	no
14095	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	da- take a  word  and, uh, have a canonical pronunciation	no
14096	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	and, uh, if there was five phones in a word,  you'd break up the word,	no
14097	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	uh, into five  equal-length  pieces  which is  completely  gross.	no
14098	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Wrong.  Yeah.	no
14099	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Right? I mean, th- the timing is off   all  over the place in just about  any  word.	no
14100	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
14101	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
14102	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K.	no
14103	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	But it's O_ K.	no
14104	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	You start  off  with that and the statistical system then  aligns  things, and eventually you get something that doesn't  really  look too  bad.	no
14105	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Oh, excellent. O_K.	no
14106	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	So - so I think using a - a good  aligner, um, actually can - can help a  lot.  Um.	no
14107	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	But, uh, you know, they  both  help each  other.  If you have a - if you have a  better  starting point, then it helps the  aligner.	no
14108	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	If you have a good alignment, it helps the, uh, th- the human in - in taking less time to  correct  things. So - so -	no
14109	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K.	no
14110	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Excellent.	no
14111	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I guess there's  another  aspect,  too,  and I don't know - uh, this - this is -	no
14112	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	very possibly a different, uh, topic. But,  uh, just let me say  with reference to this idea of, um,	no
14113	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	higher-order organization within meetings. So like in a -	no
14114	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	you know, the topics that are covered during a meeting with reference to the other, uh,	no
14115	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
14116	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	uses  of the data, so being able to   find  where so-and-so talked about such-and-such,	no
14117	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	then, um,	no
14118	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	um -	no
14119	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	e- I mean, I - I - I did sort of a -	no
14120	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	a rough  pass  on encoding, like, episode-like level	no
14121	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
14122	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	things on the, uh,  transcribed  meeting -	no
14123	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	already  transcribed meeting.	no
14124	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
14125	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And I don't know if, um -	no
14126	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	where   that - i- if that's something that we wanna  do  with each meeting, sort of like a, um -	no
14127	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	it's like a  manifest,  when you get a box full of stuff,   or - or if that's, um -	no
14128	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
14129	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I mean, i- I - I don't know what	no
14130	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	uh,	no
14131	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	level of detail would be most  useful.  I don't know i- if that's something that   I  should do when I look  over  it, or if we want someone  else  to do, or whatever.	no
14132	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
14133	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	But this issue of the  contents  of the meeting	no
14134	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	in an outline form.	no
14135	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K.	no
14136	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
14137	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Meaning  really isn't my thing.	no
14138	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Um -	no
14139	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I think it just -	no
14140	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	whoever is interested can  do  that.	no
14141	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I mean, so if someone wants to use that data -	no
14142	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K.	no
14143	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	We're running a little short here. We, uh, uh, cou- trying to -	no
14144	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	That's fine.	no
14145	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I'm finished.	no
14146	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	eh, was - p- Well, you know, the thing I'm concerned about is we wanted to do these digits and - and I haven't heard, uh, from Jose yet. So -	yes
14147	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I'm finished.	no
14148	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	eh, was - p- Well, you know, the thing I'm concerned about is we wanted to do these digits and - and I haven't heard, uh, from Jose yet. So -	no
14149	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Oh, yeah.	no
14150	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Oh, yes. Mm-hmm.	no
14151	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K. What do you want?	no
14152	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Uh -	no
14153	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	We could  skip  the digits. We don't  have  to read digits each time.	no
14154	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Uh -	no
14155	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I - I -  I  think it - you know, another - another bunch of digits. More data is good.	no
14156	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K.	no
14157	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. Sure.	no
14158	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	So - so I'd  like  to do that. But I think, do you, maybe, eh - ?	no
14159	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Did you  prepare  some whole thing you wanted us just to see? Or what was that?	no
14160	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. It's - it's prepared.	no
14161	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. Uh, how long a - ?	no
14162	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Oh, k- Sorry.	no
14163	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I - I think it's - it's fast, because, uh,	no
14164	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I have the results, eh, of the study of different energy without the  law length .	no
14165	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Eh, um, eh,  @@  in the - in the measurement, uh, the average, uh, dividing by the - by the, um, variance.	no
14166	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
14167	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Um, I -	no
14168	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	th- i-	no
14169	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	the other, uh - the - the last w- uh, meeting -	no
14170	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	eh, I don't know if you  remain   - we have problem to - with the -	no
14171	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	with - with the parameter - with the representations of parameter,	no
14172	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yes.	no
14173	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	because the - the valleys and the peaks in the signal, eh, look like, eh, it doesn't follow to the - to the energy in the signal.	no
14174	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Right.	no
14175	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And it was a problem, uh, with the scale.	no
14176	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Eh, the scale.	no
14177	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	With what?	no
14178	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Scale.	no
14179	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Scale.	no
14180	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Eh, and I - I change the scale and we can see the - the variance.	no
14181	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K.	no
14182	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	But the bottom line is it's still not, uh, separating out very well. Right? O_K.	no
14183	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. Yeah. The distribution - the distribution is - is similar.	no
14184	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	So that's -	no
14185	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	that's - that's enough then. O_K.	no
14186	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
14187	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	No, I mean, that there's no point in going through all of that if that's the bottom line, really. So, I - I think we have to start -	no
14188	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. Yeah.	no
14189	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
14190	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Uh, I mean, there- there's  two  suggestions, really, which is, uh - what we said before is that,	no
14191	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mmm, yeah.	no
14192	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	um, it looks like,	no
14193	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	@@	no
14194	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	at  least  that you haven't found an  obvious  way to normalize so that the energy is anything like a reliable, uh, indicator of the overlap.	no
14195	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
14196	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Um, I - I'm - I'm  still   a little f- think that's a  little  funny. These things l-  @@  seems like there  should  be, but -	no
14197	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
14198	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
14199	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	but you don't want to keep, uh - keep knocking at it if it's - if you're not getting any - any  result  with that.	no
14200	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	But, I mean, the other things that we talked about is, uh,	no
14201	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	pitch-related things and harmonicity-related things, so - which we thought also should be some kind of a reasonable indicator.	no
14202	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
14203	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Um -	no
14204	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	But, uh,	no
14205	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	a completely  different  tack on it wou- is the one that was suggested, uh, by your colleagues in  Spain,	no
14206	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
14207	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	which is to say, don't worry so much about the, uh, features.	no
14208	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
14209	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	That is to say, use, you know, as - as you're doing with the speech, uh, nonspeech, use some very  general  features.	no
14210	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
14211	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And, uh, then, uh, look at it  more  from the aspect of  modeling.	no
14212	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
14213	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	You know, have a - have a couple Markov models and -	no
14214	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
14215	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
14216	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	and, uh, try to indi- try to determine, you know, w- when is th- when are you  in  an overlap, when are you  not  in an overlap.	no
14217	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Hmm.	no
14218	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And let the, uh, uh, statistical system  determine what's the right way to look at the data.	no
14219	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I - I, um,	no
14220	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
14221	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I  think  it would be  interesting  to find individual features and put them together. I think that you'd end up with a better  system  overall.	no
14222	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	But given the limitation in  time	no
14223	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
14224	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	and given the fact that Javier's system already  exists    doing  this sort of thing,	no
14225	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
14226	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	uh, but, uh,	no
14227	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	its main limitation is that, again, it's only looking at silences which  would  -	no
14228	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
14229	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
14230	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	maybe  that's  a better place to go.	no
14231	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
14232	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	So.	no
14233	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
14234	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I - I - I think that, eh, the possibility, eh, can be that, eh,	no
14235	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Thilo, eh, working, eh, with a new class,	no
14236	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
14237	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	not only, eh, nonspeech and speech, but, eh, in - in - in the speech class,	no
14238	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
14239	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	dividing, eh, speech, eh, of - from a speaker and overlapping,	no
14240	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	to try - to - to do, eh, eh, a fast - a fast, eh,	no
14241	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	experiment to - to prove that, nnn, this fea- eh, general feature,	no
14242	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
14243	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	eh, can solve the - the - the  problem,  and wh- what -	no
14244	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Maybe. Yeah.	no
14245	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	nnn, how far is -	no
14246	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And, I - I have prepared the - the pitch tracker now.	no
14247	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
14248	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And I hope the - the next week I will have, eh, some results and we - we will show - we will see, eh, the - the parameter - the pitch,	no
14249	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I see.	no
14250	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	eh, tracking in - with the program.	no
14251	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Ha- h- have you ever looked at the, uh, uh - Javier's, uh,	no
14252	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And, nnn, nnn -	no
14253	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	speech segmenter?	no
14254	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	No.	no
14255	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Oh. Maybe m- you could, you kn-  uh   show  Thilo that.	no
14256	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	No.	no
14257	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	No.	no
14258	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. Yeah.	no
14259	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. Sure.	no
14260	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Cuz again the idea is there - the limitation there again was that he was - he was only using it to look at silence as a - as a - as a - as a p- putative	no
14261	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I -	no
14262	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
14263	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	split point between speakers. But if you included, uh,	no
14264	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K.	no
14265	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	broadened classes then  in principle maybe you can  cover the overlap cases.	no
14266	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
14267	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mmm, yeah.	no
14268	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah, but I'm not too sure if - if we can  really represent	no
14269	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Uh -	no
14270	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	overlap with - with the s-  detector I - I - I used up to now, the - to speech-nonspeech as -	no
14271	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
14272	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I think with -	no
14273	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Ah.	no
14274	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	it's only speech or it's - it's - it's nonspeech. So.	no
14275	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	That's right. But I think Javier's -	no
14276	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
14277	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
14278	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	N- n-	no
14279	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I think Javier's  might  be able to. It doesn't have the same Gaus- uh, H_M_ M  modeling, which is I think a  drawback.	no
14280	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
14281	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K.	no
14282	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	But, uh -	no
14283	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Well, it's - sort of has a	no
14284	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mmm, yeah.	no
14285	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	simple  one. Right? It's -	no
14286	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Does  it?	no
14287	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	it's just - it's just a - isn't it just a Gaussian	no
14288	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	for each - ?	no
14289	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
14290	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
14291	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Hmm.	no
14292	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
14293	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
14294	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And then  he ch- you choose optimal splitting.	no
14295	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Oh, it doesn't have - it doesn't have any temporal, uh - ? I thought it -	no
14296	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	@@	no
14297	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Maybe I'm misremembering, but I did  not  think it had a Markov -	no
14298	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
14299	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I gues-	no
14300	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I guess  I  don't remember  either.	no
14301	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Uh. It's been a while.	no
14302	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Javier -	no
14303	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Uh.	no
14304	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.  Uh, I could have a  look  at it. So.	no
14305	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	You mean Ja- eh, eh, Javier program? No, Javier di- doesn't worked with, uh, a Markov -	no
14306	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
14307	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah, I didn't think so.	no
14308	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Oh,  O_K . So he's just - he just computes a Gaussian over potential - Oh,  I  see.  I  see. And - and -	no
14309	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	He on- only train -	no
14310	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yep.	no
14311	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. It was only Gaussian.	no
14312	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	This is the idea.	no
14313	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And so I - I think it would work  fine  for detecting overlap.	no
14314	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	It's just, uh,	no
14315	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	that i- it - he has the two-pass issue that -	no
14316	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	What he  does  is, as a  first  pass he - he - p- he does,	no
14317	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	um, a  guess  at where the divisions  might  be and he overestimates.	no
14318	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And that's just a data  reduction  step,	no
14319	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	so that you're not  trying  at every  time  interval.	no
14320	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_K.	no
14321	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And so those are the  putative    places  where he  tries.	no
14322	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
14323	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. O_K.	no
14324	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	And right now he's doing that with  silence   and that doesn't work	no
14325	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	with the Meeting Recorder.	no
14326	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
14327	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	So if we used  another   method  to get the first pass, I think it would probably work. It's a good method.	no
14328	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. Sure.	no
14329	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. Yeah, O_K.	no
14330	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	As long as the len- as long the segments are long enough.	no
14331	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
14332	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	O_k- O_K. So let me go back to what  you  had, though. Um.	no
14333	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	That's the other problem.	no
14334	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	So -	no
14335	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
14336	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
14337	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	The  other  thing one could do	no
14338	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	is - Couldn't - I mean, it's - So you have two categories	no
14339	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	and you have Markov models for  each.	no
14340	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
14341	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Couldn't you have a third category?	no
14342	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	So you have, uh - you have,	no
14343	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	uh, nonspeech, single-person speech, and multiple-person speech?	no
14344	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	He has this on his board actually.	no
14345	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Don't you have, like those - those several different  categories on the board?	no
14346	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Right? And then you have a Markov model for each?	no
14347	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Um -	no
14348	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I'm not sure. I - I thought about, uh, adding, uh, uh, another class too. But it's not too easy, I think, the -	no
14349	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	the transition between the different class, to model them in - in the system  I  have  now.  But it - it - it  could  be possible, I think,	no
14350	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I see.	no
14351	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I see.	no
14352	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	in principle.	no
14353	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah, I mean, I -  @@	no
14354	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	This is all pretty  gross.  I mean, the - th- the reason why, uh, I was suggesting originally that we look at  features  is because I thought, well, we're doing something we haven't  done  before,	no
14355	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	@@	no
14356	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
14357	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
14358	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	we should at least look at the  space  and understand -	no
14359	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
14360	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
14361	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	It seems like if two people - two or more people talk at once, it should get  louder,	no
14362	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
14363	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	uh, and, uh, uh, there should be some discontinuity in pitch contours,	no
14364	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I had the impression.	no
14365	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
14366	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	and, uh, there should overall be a, um, smaller proportion of the total energy that is explained by any particular harmonic  sequence in the spectrum.	no
14367	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
14368	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
14369	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Right.	no
14370	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	So those are all things that  should  be there. So far,	no

14379	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah .	no
14380	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	uh, the - has - has, uh,	no
14381	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	been exploring, uh, e-  largely  the energy issue and,	no
14382	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	um,	no
14383	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	as with a  lot  of things, it is not - uh, like this, it's not as simple as it  sounds.  And then there's, you know - Is it  energy?  Is it  log  energy? Is it L_P_C  residual  energy? Is it - is it -	no
14384	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
14385	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	is it, uh,  delta  of those things? Uh, what is it no- Obviously, just a simple number -	no
14386	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	absolute  number  isn't gonna work. So	no
14387	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	it should be with - compared to  what?  Should there be a long window for the	no
14388	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	normalizing  factor and a short window for what you're  looking  at? Or, you know, how b- short should they be? So,	no
14389	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
14390	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	th- he's been playing around with a lot of these different things and - and so far at least has not come up with	no
14391	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Hmm.	no
14392	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	any  combination that really gave you an  indicator.  So	no
14393	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
14394	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I - I  still  have a hunch that there's - it's in there some place, but it may be - given that you have a limited time here, it - it just may not be the best thing to -	no
14395	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
14396	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	to - to  focus  on for the remaining of it. So pitch-related and harmonic-related,	no
14397	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	To overrule , yeah.	no
14398	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
14399	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I'm - I'm  somewhat more hopeful for it.	no
14400	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
14401	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	But it  seems  like if we just wanna get something to  work,	no
14402	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
14403	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	that, uh, their suggestion of - of -	no
14404	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
14405	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Th-  they  were suggesting going to Markov  models,	no
14406	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	uh, but in addition there's an expansion of what  Javier  did. And  one  of those things, looking at the statistical component,	no
14407	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	One.	no
14408	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
14409	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	even if the features that you give it are maybe not  ideal  for it, it's just sort of this general filter bank or -	no
14410	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
14411	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	or cepstrum or something, um -	no
14412	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Eee  it's in there  somewhere  probably.	no
14413	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	But, eh, what did you think about the possibility of  using  the Javier  software?	no
14414	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Eh, I mean, the, uh - the, uh - the  BIC   criterion, the - the - t- to train the - the Gaussian,	no
14415	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	eh, using the - the mark, eh, by hand, eh, eh, to distinguish be- mmm, to train overlapping zone and speech zone. I mean,	no
14416	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	eh,  I - I - I think that an interesting, eh, experiment, eh, could be,	no
14417	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	th- eh, to prove that, mmm, if s- we suppose that, eh, the - the first step -	no
14418	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I mean, the - the classifier	no
14419	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	what were the classifier from Javier or classifier from Thilo?	no
14420	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	W- What happen with the second step?	no
14421	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I - I mean, what - what happen with the, eh - the, uh, clu- the, uh - the clu- the clustering process?	no
14422	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Mm-hmm.	no
14423	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Using the - the Gaussian. Yeah.	no
14424	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	You mean Javier's?	no
14425	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	What do you mean?	no
14426	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I - I mean, that is - is enough - is enough, eh, to work well, eh, to, eh, separate or to distinguish, eh, between overlapping zone and, eh, speaker zone?	no
14427	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Because th-  if - if we - if we, eh, nnn, develop an classifier -	no
14428	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	I -	no
14429	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	and the second step doesn't work  well, eh, we have  another problem.  N-	no
14430	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. I had  tried  doing it by  hand  at one point with a very short sample, and it worked pretty  well,  but I haven't worked with it a  lot.	no
14431	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	So what I d- I d- I took a  hand-segmented  sample and I added	no
14432	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Nnn, yeah.	no
14433	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	ten times the amount of numbers at  random,	no
14434	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
14435	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Oh.	no
14436	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	and it did pick  out	no
14437	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. But is - is - if -	no
14438	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	pretty good boundaries. But this was just very anecdotal sort of thing.	no
14439	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	But it's possible with my segmentation by  hand   that we have information about the - the overlapping, uh - Yeah.	no
14440	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Right. So if we - if we	no
14441	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	fed the hand-segmentation to Javier's	no
14442	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	The -	no
14443	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	N- n- Yeah. No.	no
14444	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	and it  doesn't   work,  then we know something's wrong.	no
14445	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	The demonstration  by hand. Segmentation by hand I - I - I think is the fast experiment.	no
14446	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah. I think that's probably worthwhile doing.	no
14447	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Uh-huh.	no
14448	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Uh, we can prove that the -	no
14449	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Whether it'll work or not.  Yeah.	no
14450	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	this kind o-	no
14451	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yeah.	no
14452	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	emph-  emphasizes  parameter and Gaussian -	no
14453	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Yep.	no
14454	transcript	transcript_Bmr010	Y- do you know where his software is? Have you used it at all?	no

14618	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	We went -	no
14619	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well, I had a - just a  quick  question but I know there was  discussion  of it at a previous meeting that I  missed,  but just about the -	no
14620	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	the  wish  list item of getting good quality close-talking mikes on every speaker.	no
14621	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K, so let's - let's - So let's just do agenda  building right now. O_K, so let's talk about that a bit.	no
14622	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I mean, that was -	no
14623	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Uh,  @@  tuss- close talking mikes, better quality. O_K,  uh, we can talk about that. You were gonna - starting to say something?	no
14624	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well, you - you, um, already know about the meeting  that's coming up and I don't know if - if	no
14625	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	this is appropriate for this.  I don't know. I mean, maybe - maybe it's something we should handle outside of the meeting.	no
14626	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	What  meeting?	no
14627	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	No, no, that's O_K. We can - so - we can ta- so n- NIST is - NIST folks are coming by next week and so we can talk about that.	no
14628	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K.	no
14629	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
14630	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Who's  coming?	no
14631	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I think	no
14632	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Uh, uh, John Fiscus and, uh, I think George Doddington will be	no
14633	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
14634	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	around as well.	no
14635	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Uh, O_K, so we can talk about that. Uh, I guess just hear about how things are going with, uh, uh, the transcriptions. That's right. That would sorta be an obvious thing to discuss.	no
14636	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Sure. Mm-hmm.	no
14637	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Um,	no
14638	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	An- anything else, uh,	no
14639	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	strike anybody?	no
14640	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Uh, we started  running recognition on  one conversation but it's the r-  isn't working yet.  So,	no
14641	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K.	no
14642	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	But if anyone has -	no
14643	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Wha-	no
14644	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, the  main  thing would be if anyone has, um, knowledge about ways to, uh, post-process the wave forms that would give us better recognition, that would be helpful to know about.	no
14645	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Um,	no
14646	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Dome  yeah, it sounds like a topic of conversation.	no
14647	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, so, uh -	no
14648	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	What about, uh, is there anything new with the speech, nonspeech	no
14649	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah , we're working more on it but,  it's not finished.	no
14650	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	stuff?	no
14651	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K.	no
14652	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Alright,  that seems like a - a good collection of things. And we'll undoubtedly think of  other things.	no
14653	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I had thought under  my  topic that I would mention the, uh, four items that I - I, uh, put out for being on the agenda f- on that  meeting,  which includes like the pre-segmentation and the - and the developments in multitrans.	no
14654	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Oh, under the NIST meeting.	no
14655	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, under the NIST thing. Yeah.	no
14656	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K.	no
14657	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Alright, why don't we start off with this,	no
14658	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	u- u-	no
14659	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I guess the order we brought  them   up seems fine. Um,	no
14660	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
14661	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	so, better quality close talking mikes. So the one issue was that the - the, uh, lapel mike, uh, isn't as good as you would like. And so,	yes
14662	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	so, better quality close talking mikes. So the one issue was that the - the, uh, lapel mike, uh, isn't as good as you would like. And so,	no
14663	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, it - it'd be  better  if we had close talking mikes for  everybody.  Right?	no
14664	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Is that - is that basically the point?	no
14665	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Ri- um,	no
14666	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	yeah, the -	no
14667	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And actually in  addition  to that, that the -	no
14668	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	the close talking mikes are worn in such a way as to best capture the signal.	no
14669	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And the  reason  here is just that for the people doing  work  not on microphones but on sort of like  dialogue  and so forth,	no
14670	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh - or and even on  prosody,  which Don is gonna be working on soon,	no
14671	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	it adds this extra, you know, vari-  variable  for each speaker to - to deal with when the microphones aren't similar.	no
14672	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right.	no
14673	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
14674	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So - And I  also  talked to Mari this morning and she  also  had a strong preference for doing that. And in fact she said that	no
14675	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	that's useful for them to know in starting to collect  their  data too.	no
14676	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
14677	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right, so one th-	no
14678	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well, so -	no
14679	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, well one thing I was gonna say was that, um,	no
14680	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	i-	no
14681	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	we could get more, uh, of the head mounted microphones even beyond the number of  radio  channels we have because	no
14682	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I think whether it's radio or wire is probably second-order. And the main thing is having the microphone  close  to you, u- although, not too close.	no
14683	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
14684	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right, so, uh, actually the way Jose is wearing  his  is - is c-  correct. The good way. So you want to -	no
14685	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
14686	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Is -	no
14687	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
14688	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I- it's  not  cor- it's  correct?	no
14689	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Is.	no
14690	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, th- that's good. So it's towards the corner of your mouth so that breath sounds don't get on it. And then just sort of	no
14691	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
14692	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yes.	no
14693	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
14694	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
14695	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
14696	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	about, uh, a thumb or - a thumb and a half away from your - from your mouth.	no
14697	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
14698	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Uh, yeah.	no
14699	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right.	no
14700	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	How am I d-	no
14701	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	But we have more than one type of - I mean, for instance, you're -	no
14702	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
14703	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And  this  one isn't very  adjustable,  so this about as good as I can get cuz it's a fixed boom.	no
14704	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
14705	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right.	no
14706	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
14707	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Is fixed. Yeah.	no
14708	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
14709	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	But if we could actually standardize, you know, the - the microphones, uh, as much as possible that would be really helpful.	no
14710	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
14711	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
14712	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
14713	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well, I mean it doesn't hurt to have a few extra microphones around, so why don't we just go out and - and get an order of - of if this microphone seems O_K to people,	no
14714	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
14715	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, I'd just get a half dozen of these things.	no
14716	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well the onl- the only problem with that is right now, um, some of the Jimlets aren't working.	no
14717	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	The little - the boxes under the table.	no
14718	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
14719	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And so, w- Uh, I've only been able to find three jacks that are working.	no
14720	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
14721	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Can we get  these,  wireless?	no
14722	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So -	no
14723	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	No, but my  point  is -	no
14724	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	But y- we could just record these signals separately and time align them with the start of the meeting.	no
14725	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	R- r- right -	no
14726	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I - I'm not sure I'm follow.  Say that again?	no
14727	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right now,	no
14728	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	we've got, uh, two microphones in the room,	no
14729	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	that are not quote-unquote  standard.  So why don't we replace those -	no
14730	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K, just  two.	no
14731	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well, however many we can plug  in.  You know, if we can plug in  three,  let's plug in  three.  Also what we've talked before about getting another, uh,  radio,	no
14732	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K.	no
14733	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-yeah.	no
14734	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right.	no
14735	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	and so then that would be, you know,  three   more.	no
14736	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right. O_K.	no
14737	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
14738	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So, uh - so we should go out to our full complement of whatever we can  do,	no
14739	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	but have them  all  be the same  mike.  I think the original reason	no
14740	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	that it was done the  other  way was because, it w- it was sort of an experimental thing and I don't think anybody knew whether people would rather have more variety or -	no
14741	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right.	no
14742	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	or, uh, more uniformity, but -	no
14743	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	@@	no
14744	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	but uh,	no
14745	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	sounds - sounds fine.	no
14746	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Sounds like uniformity wins.	no
14747	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right .	no
14748	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
14749	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well, for short term research it's just - there's just so much	no
14750	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	effort that would have to be done up front n- uh, so - yeah, uniformity would be great.	no
14751	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well -	no
14752	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
14753	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Is it because -	no
14754	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	You - you're saying the - for dialogue purposes, so that means that the transcribers are having trouble with those	no
14755	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	mikes? Is that what you mean? Or - ?	no
14756	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well  Jane  would know more about the  transcribers.	no
14757	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And that's true. I mean, I - we  did   discuss  this. Uh, and - and -	no
14758	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yep.	no
14759	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Couple times.	no
14760	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	a  couple  times,  so, um, yeah, the  transcribers  notice - And in  fact  there're  some  where, um -	no
14761	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	ugh  well, I mean there's - it's the  double  thing. It's the  equipment  and also how it's  worn.	no
14762	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And he's always - they always - they just rave about how wonderful Adam's -  Adam's  channel is.	no
14763	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right.	no
14764	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	What can I say.	no
14765	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And then,	no
14766	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So does the recognizer.	no
14767	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
14768	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	"Oh, really? Yeah, I'm not surprised. I mean, ""Baaah!"""	no
14769	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
14770	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, but I mean it's  not  just  that,  it's also you know you-	no
14771	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Even if - if you're talking on someone  else's  mike it's still  you w-	no
14772	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
14773	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	It's also like n- no breathing, no -  You know, it's like it's -	no
14774	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
14775	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	it's um, it's really -  it makes a big difference from the transcribers' point of view and also from the research s- point of view.	no
14776	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
14777	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, it's an advantage when you don't breath.	no
14778	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, I think that the  point  of doing the close talking  mike  is to get a good quality  signal.  We're not doing research on close talking mikes.	no
14779	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right.	no
14780	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	When we're doing -	no
14781	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
14782	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So we might as  well  get it as uniform as we can.	no
14783	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
14784	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right.	no
14785	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Now, this is	no
14786	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	locking the barn door after the horse was stolen. We do have thirty hours, of - of speech, which is done this way. But -	no
14787	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
14788	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	That's  O_K.	no
14789	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	but, uh,  yeah,  for  future  ones we can get it a bit more uniform.	no
14790	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Great, great.	no
14791	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So I think just do a field trip at some point.	no
14792	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, probably - yeah, to the store we talked about and that -	no
14793	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yep.	no
14794	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And there was  some  talk about, uh, maybe the h- headphones that are  uncomfortable  for people, to -	no
14795	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yep.	no
14796	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So, as - as I said, we'll do a field trip and see if we can get all of the same mike that's more comfortable than - than these things, which I think are horrible.	no
14797	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K.	no
14798	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So.	no
14799	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Good.	no
14800	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Great, thank you very much.  It's makes our job a lot easier.	no
14801	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Especially for people with big heads.	no
14802	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K.	no
14803	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And, you know, we're  researchers,  so we  all  have big heads.	no
14804	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K.	no
14805	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
14806	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K.	no
14807	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
14808	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Uh,	no
14809	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K, second item was the, uh,	no
14810	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	NIST visit, and what's going on there.	no
14811	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	yes
14812	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	NIST visit, and what's going on there.	no
14813	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
14814	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K, so, um, uh,	no
14815	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Jonathan Fiscus is coming on the second of February and I've spoken with, uh,  u- u- a  lot  of people here, not  everyone.  Um, and, um,	no
14816	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	he expressed an interest in seeing the room and in, um, seeing a demonstration of the modified multitrans, which I'll mention in a second,	no
14817	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	and also, um, he was interested in the pre-segmentation and then he's also  interested   in the transcription conventions.	no
14818	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
14819	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And, um - So, um, it seems to me in terms of like, um,	no
14820	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	i- i- it wou-	no
14821	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	You know, O_K. So the  room,  it's things like the audio and c- and audi- audio and acoustic - acoustic properties of the  room  and how it - how the  recordings  are done, and that kind of thing.	no
14822	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And, um. O_K, in terms of the  multi-trans,  well that - that's being modified by Dave Gelbart to, uh, handle multi-channel recording.	no
14823	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Oh, I should've -	no
14824	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I was just thinking I should have invited him to this  meeting.  I forgot to do it.	no
14825	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, O_K.	no
14826	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So.	no
14827	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
14828	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Sorry.	no
14829	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah. Well that's O_K, I mean we'll -	no
14830	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, and it's t- and it  looks  really great. He - he has a prototype. I - I, uh,	no
14831	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	@@	no
14832	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	didn't - didn't see it, uh,  yesterday  but I'm going to see it  today.	no
14833	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And, uh, that's - that will enable us to do  nice	no
14834	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	um, tight  time  marking of the beginning and  ending  of overlapping segments. At present it's not  possible  with limitations of -	no
14835	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	of the, uh, original  design of the software.	no
14836	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And um.	no
14837	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So,  I  don't know.	no
14838	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	In terms of, like,  pre-segmentation,  that - that  continues  to be, um, a  terrific  asset to the - to the  transcribers.	no
14839	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Do you - I know that you're al- also supplementing it further. Do you want to mention something about that c- Thilo, or - ?	no
14840	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Um, yeah. What - what I'm doing right now is I'm trying to	no
14841	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	include some information about which channel, uh, there's some speech	no
14842	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	in. But that's not working at the moment. I'm just trying to do this by comparing energies, uh -	no
14843	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K.	no
14844	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	normalizing energies and comparing energies of the different channels. And	no
14845	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	so to - to give the transcribers some information in which channel there's - there's speech in addition to - to the thing we - we did	no
14846	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	now which is just, uh, speech-nonspeech detection on the mixed file.	no
14847	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	This is good. Mm-hmm.	no
14848	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So I'm - I'm relying on - on the segmentation of the mixed file but I'm - I'm trying to	no
14849	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	subdivide the speech portions into	no
14850	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	different portions if there is some activity in - in  different  channels.	no
14851	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Excellent, so this'd be like w- e- providing also  speaker  I_D  potentially.  Wonderful.	no
14852	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	But -	no
14853	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.  Yeah.	no
14854	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Wonderful.	no
14855	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Um, something I guess I didn't put in the  list  but, uh,	no
14856	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	on that, uh,  same  day later on in - or maybe it's -	no
14857	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	No,  actually   it's  this  week,	no
14858	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, Dave Gelbart and I will be, uh, visiting with John  Canny  who i- you know, is a C_S professor,	no
14859	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Oh.	no
14860	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	H_C_C .	no
14861	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	who's interested in ar- in  array  microphones.	no
14862	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Oh, he's doing array mikes.	no
14863	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
14864	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And so we wanna see what commonality there is here. You know, maybe they'd wanna	no
14865	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	stick an array mike here when we're  doing  things  or - or maybe	no
14866	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	That  would be  cool.	no
14867	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, that would be neat.	no
14868	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
14869	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	That would be really neat.	no
14870	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	it's - it's not a  specific  array microphone they want but they might wanna just, - uh, you know, you could imagine them taking the four signals from these - these  table  mikes and trying to do something with  them  -	no
14871	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Um, I  also  had a discussion - So, w- uh, we'll be over - over there talking with him, um, after class on Friday. Um,	no
14872	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	we'll let you know what - what goes with that. Also had a completely unrelated thing. I had a, uh, discussion today with, uh, Birger Kollmeier who's a,	no
14873	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, a German, uh, scientist who's got a fair sized group  doing a range of things. It's sort of auditory related, largely for hearing aids and so on. But -	no
14874	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	but, uh, he does stuff with auditory models and he's very interested in directionality, and location, and -	no
14875	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	and, uh, head models and	no
14876	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	microphone things. And so, uh, he's - he and possibly a student, there w- there's, uh, a student of his who gave a talk here	no
14877	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	last year, uh, may come here, uh, in the fall for, uh, sort of a five month, uh, sabbatical. So he might be around.	no
14878	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Get him to give some talks and so on. But  anyway,  he might be interested in  this stuff.	no
14879	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
14880	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	That - that reminds me, I had a - a thought of an interesting  project  that	no
14881	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	somebody could try to do with  the data from here, either using, you know, the - the mikes on the table or	no
14882	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
14883	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	using signal energies from the  head  worn mikes, and that is to try to construct a map of where people were  sitting,	no
14884	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right.	no
14885	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Uh-huh.	no
14886	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well Dan - Dan had worked on that. Dan Ellis, yeah.	no
14887	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, based on -	no
14888	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Uh-huh.	no
14889	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Oh,  did  he? Oh, that's interesting.	no
14890	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So that - that's the cross-correlation stuff, was -	no
14891	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
14892	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	was doing b- beam-forming.	no
14893	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And so you could plot out who was sitting next to who and -	no
14894	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	A  little  bit, I mean, he didn't do a very  extreme thing  but just - it was just sort of	no
14895	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, yeah.	no
14896	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	No, he did start on it.	no
14897	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	e- e- given that, the - the - the block of wood with the - the - the two mikes  on either side,	no
14898	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
14899	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	if  I'm  speaking, or if  you're  speaking, or someone over  there  is speaking, it - if you look at cross-correlation functions, you end up with a -	no
14900	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
14901	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	if - if someone who was on the axis between the two is talking, then you - you get a big peak  there.  And if - if someone's talking on - on - on, uh, one side or the other, it goes the  other  way. And then,	no
14902	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
14903	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, it - it - it  even  looks  different  if th- t- if the  two  - two people on either side are talking than if one in the middle. It - it actually looks somewhat different, so.	no
14904	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Hmm.	no
14905	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well I was just thinking, you know, as I was sitting here next to  Thilo  that	no
14906	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
14907	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	um,	no
14908	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	when he's  talking,	no
14909	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	my  mike probably picks it up better than   your   guys's   mikes. So if you just looked at -	no
14910	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
14911	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Oh, that's another cl- cue, that's true.	no
14912	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
14913	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	yeah,  looked at  the energy on my mike and you could get an idea about  who's   closest  to  who.	no
14914	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
14915	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
14916	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
14917	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right.	no
14918	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
14919	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And -	no
14920	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Or who talks the loudest.	no
14921	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
14922	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
14923	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, well you have to - the appropriate normalizations are tricky, and - and - and are probably the key.	no
14924	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
14925	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
14926	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	You just search for Adam's voice on each individual microphone, you pretty much know where everybody's sitting.	no
14927	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
14928	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
14929	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah. We've switched positions recently so you can't -  Anyway.	no
14930	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K.	no
14931	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So those are just a little couple of news items.	no
14932	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Can I ask one thing? Uh, so, um,	no
14933	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Jonathan Fiscus expressed an interest in, uh,  microphone  arrays.	no
14934	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yes.	no
14935	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Um, is there - I mean - b- And I  also  want to say, his - he can't stay all day. He needs to	no
14936	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, leave for - uh, from here to make a two forty-five flight	no
14937	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Oh,  so just  morning.	no
14938	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	from - from Oakland.	no
14939	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right.	no
14940	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So it makes the scheduling a little bit tight but do you think that, um - that, uh, i- John Canny should be involved in this somehow or  not.  I have no idea.	no
14941	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Probably  not but I - I'll - I'll - I'll know better after I see him this Friday what - what kind of level he wants to get involved.	no
14942	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	It's premature.	no
14943	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Fine.	no
14944	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Good.	no
14945	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Uh, he might be  excited  to and it might be very  appropriate  for him to, uh, or he might have no interest  whatsoever.  I - I just really don't know.	no
14946	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K.	no
14947	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Is  he  involved in - Ach!  I'm blanking on the name of the project.	no
14948	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	NIST has - has done a big meeting room - instrumented meeting room with video and microphone arrays, and	no
14949	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	very elaborate software. Is - is he the one working on that?	no
14950	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well  that's  what they're starting  up.	no
14951	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K.	no
14952	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah. No, I mean, that's what all this is  about.  They - they  haven't  done it yet.	no
14953	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K. I had read some papers that looked like they had already done  some  work.	no
14954	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	They  wanted  to do it -	no
14955	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Uh, well I  think  they've instrumented a  room  but I don't  think they - they haven't started recordings yet. They don't have the t- the transcription standards. They don't have the -	no
14956	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Are they going to do  video  as  well?	no
14957	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Hmm.	no
14958	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
14959	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Hmm.	no
14960	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I  think.  I  think  they are.	no
14961	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Oh, cuz what - what  I  had read was, uh, they had a uh	no
14962	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	very   large  amount of software infrastructure for coordinating all this, both	no
14963	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	in terms of recording and also live room where you're interacting - the participants are interacting with the computer, and with the video, and lots of other stuff.	no
14964	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well, I'm - I'm - I'm not sure. All - all I know is that they've been talking to me about a project that they're  going  to start up	no
14965	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So.	no
14966	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K. Well -	no
14967	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	recording people meet- in meetings. And, uh, it is related to ours. They were interested in ours. They wanted to get some uniformity with us, uh, about the transcriptions and so on.	no
14968	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Alright.	no
14969	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And one -  one  notable difference - u- u- actually I can't  remember  whether they were going to routinely collect video or not,  but one -	no
14970	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	one, uh, difference from the  audio  side was that they  are  interested in using  array  mikes.	no
14971	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So, um, I mean, I'll just tell you the party line on that. The reason I  didn't  go for that here	no
14972	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	was because, uh, the focus, uh, both of  my  interest and of  Adam's  interest was	no
14973	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, in impromptu situations. And	no
14974	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	we're  not   recording  a bunch of impromptu situations but that's because it's different to get data for  research  than to	no
14975	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	actually  apply  it. And so, uh, for  scientific  reasons we thought it was good to instrument this  room  as we wanted it.	no
14976	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Hmm.	no
14977	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	But the thing we  ultimately  wanted to aim at was a situation where	no
14978	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	you were talking with, uh, one or more other people	no
14979	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	i- uh, in - in an p-  impromptu  way, where you didn't - didn't actually  know  what the situation was going to  be.  And therefore it would not - it'd be highly  unlikely  that room would be outfitted with - with some very carefully designed array of  microphones.	no
14980	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Um, so it was  only  for that reason. It was just, you know, yet another piece of research and it seemed like we had enough troubles just -	no
14981	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So there's no like portable array of mikes?	no
14982	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	No. So there's - there's -	no
14983	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Hmm.	no
14984	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, there's a whole range of things - there's a whole  array  of things,  that people do on this. So, um,	no
14985	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	the, uh - the  big  arrays, uh, places, uh, like	no
14986	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, Rutgers, and Brown, and other - other places,	no
14987	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, they have, uh, big arrays with, I don't know, a hundred - hundred mikes or something. And so there's a wall of mikes. And you get	no
14988	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Xerox.	no
14989	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Wow.	no
14990	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	really,  really  good  beam-forming  with that sort of thing.	no
14991	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And it's - and, um,	no
14992	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	in  fact  at  one  point we had a - a proposal in with Rutgers where we were gonna do some of the	no
14993	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	sort of  per  channel signal-processing and they were gonna do the  multi-channel  stuff, but  it d- it d- we ended up not doing it. But -	no
14994	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I've  seen   demonstrations  of the  microphone  arrays. It's  amazing	no
14995	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, it's r-	no
14996	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	how - how they can cut out noise.	no
14997	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	It's really neat stuff. And then they had the little ones, yeah.	no
14998	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And then they have  little  ones  too  but I mean - but they  don't  have our block of  wood,  right?	no
14999	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, our block of wood is unique. But the-  But the-  No, there are these commercial things now you can buy that have four mikes or something and - and, uh,	no
15000	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15001	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
15002	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	um -	no
15003	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So, yeah, there's - there's - there's a range of things that people do.	no
15004	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Huh.	no
15005	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Um, so if we connected up with somebody who was interested in doing that sort of thing that's - that's a  good  thing to do. I mean,  whenever  I've described this to other people who are interested on the - with the acoustic side	no
15006	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	that's  invariably  the question they ask. Just like someone who is interested in the general dialogue thing will always ask	no
15007	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	"""um, are you recording  video? """	no
15008	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right, right.	no
15009	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	"Um, right? And - and the  acoustic  people will always say, ""well are you doing, uh, uh, array microphones?"" So it's -"	no
15010	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	it's a  good  thing to  do,	no
15011	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	but it  doesn't  solve the problem of  how  do you solve things when there's one mike or at best  two  mikes in - in this  imagined  P_D_A that we have.	no
15012	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So  maybe  - maybe we'll  do  some more of it.	no
15013	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well one thing I - I mean, I don't know. I mean, I  know  that having an array of - I mean, I would  imagine  it would be more  expensive  to have a -	no
15014	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	an array of microphones. But couldn't you kind of  approximate  the natural sis- situation by just shutting off	no
15015	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, channels when you're - later on? I mean, it seems like if the microphones don't  effect  each other then couldn't you just,	no
15016	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	you know,  record  them with an array and then just not  use  all the data?	no
15017	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	It's - it's just a lot of infrastructure that	no
15018	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I see. Fine.	no
15019	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	for our particular purpose we felt we didn't need to set up.	no
15020	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15021	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K.	no
15022	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, if ninety-nine percent of what you're doing is c- is shutting off  most  of the  mikes,  then going through the -	no
15023	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	But if you get somebody who's - who - who has that as a primary  interest  then that put - then that drives it in that direction.	no
15024	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	That's right, I mean if someone - if someone came in and said we really want to do it,	no
15025	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right.	no
15026	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I mean,  we  don't care. That would be fine,  Buy more disk space.	no
15027	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So to save that data you -	no
15028	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	You have to have one channel recording per mike in the array?	no
15029	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Is that -	no
15030	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well, uh, at  some  level - at  some  level. But then, you know, there's - it -	no
15031	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I usually do a mix.	no
15032	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	there's -	no
15033	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	What you save, I mean, if you're going to do research with it.  yeah	no
15034	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	There's - I - I don't know what they're going to do and I don't know how big their array is. Obviously if you were gonna save all of those channels for later research you'd use up a lot of space.	no
15035	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah. Hmm.	no
15036	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And, th-	no
15037	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well their software infrastructure had a very elaborate design for plugging in filters, and mixers, and all sorts of processing.	no
15038	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So that they can  do  stuff in real  time  and  not  save out each channel individually.	no
15039	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15040	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mmm.	no
15041	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15042	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So it was, uh -	no
15043	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15044	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	But I mean, uh,	no
15045	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	for optimum flexibility  later  you'd want to save each channel. But I think in practical situations	no
15046	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	you would have  some  engine of  some  sort doing some  processing  to  reduce  this to  some  - to the  equivalent  of a single microphone that was very  directional.	no
15047	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Uh, oh, O_K, I see.	no
15048	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right?	no
15049	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So -	no
15050	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Sort of saving the  result  of the beam-forming.	no
15051	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I mean, it seems -	no
15052	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15053	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	it seems to me that there's -	no
15054	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	you know, there are good political reasons for -	no
15055	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	for  doing  this, just  getting  the data, because there's	no
15056	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	a number of sites - like right now S_R_I is probably gonna invest a  lot  of internal funding into recording meetings also, which is  good,	no
15057	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	um, but they'll be recording with video and they'll be -	no
15058	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	You know, it'd be  nice  if we can have at least,	no
15059	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, make  use  of the data that we're  recording  as we  go  since it's sort of - this is the first site that has really  collected  these really impromptu meetings,	no
15060	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	um, and just have this other information available. So,	no
15061	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	if we can get the investment in just for the infra- infrastructure and then,	no
15062	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I don't know, save it out or have whoever's  interested	no
15063	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	save that data out, transfer it there, it'd be g- it'd be good to have - have the recording.	no
15064	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	You mean to - to actually get a microphone array and	no
15065	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I think.	no
15066	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well, if -	no
15067	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	do  that? And  video  and -	no
15068	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Even if we're not - I'm not sure about video. That's sort of an - video has a little different nature since	no
15069	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	right n- right now we're all being recorded but we're not being  taped.	no
15070	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Um, but it -  definitely  in the case of  microphone  arrays, since if there was a community  interested  in this,	no
15071	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well, but I think we need a researcher  here  who's interested in it.	no
15072	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	then -	no
15073	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	To push it  along.	no
15074	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	See the  problem  is it - it took, uh,	no
15075	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, it took at  least  six months for Dan	no
15076	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	to get together the hardware and the software, and debug stuff in - in the microphones, and in the boxes. And it was a really big deal.	no
15077	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And so I think we could get	no
15078	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	a  microphone array in here pretty easily and, uh, have it mixed to - to one channel of some sort. But,	no
15079	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
15080	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	e-	no
15081	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I  think  for  @@   I mean, how we're gonna decide -	no
15082	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	For - for maximum flexibility later you really  don't  want to end up with just one channel that's pointed in the direction of the - the - the p-	no
15083	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	the person with the maximum energy or something like that. I mean, you - you want actually to -	no
15084	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	you want actually to have multiple channels being recorded so that you can -	no
15085	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And to  do  that, it - we're going to end up greatly increasing the disk space that we use up,	no
15086	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	we  also  only have  boards  that will take up to sixteen  channels  and in   this  meeting,	no
15087	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	we've got eight people and - and six mikes. And  there  we're already using  fourteen.	no
15088	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And we actually only have  fifteen.  One of them's -	no
15089	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	E-	no
15090	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15091	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Details.  But  fifteen,  not  sixteen.	no
15092	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
15093	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15094	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15095	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well if there's a way to say time - to sort of solve each of these f- those -	no
15096	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So suppose you can get an array in because there's some person at Berkeley who's interested and has  some	no
15097	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	equipment, uh, and suppose we can -	no
15098	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	as we  save  it we can, you know, transfer it off to some other place that - that holds this - this data,	no
15099	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	who's  interested,	no
15100	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	and even if ICSI it- itself isn't.	no
15101	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Um, and it - it seems like as long as we can  time  align the  beginning,  do we need to  mix  it with the  rest?  I don't  know.	no
15102	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	You know? The- So -	no
15103	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah. So I  think  you'd need a separate - a separate set up and the assumption that you could  time  align the two.	no
15104	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15105	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And y- it'd certainly gets skew.	no
15106	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I mean it's just - it's worth considering as sort of	no
15107	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	once you make the up front investment  and can sort of save it  out  each time, and - and	no
15108	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	not have to worry about the  disk  space factor, then it mi- it might be worth having the data.	no
15109	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I'm  not  so much worried about disk space actually. I mentioned that, b- as a  practical  matter, but the  real  issue is	no
15110	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Just -	no
15111	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	that, uh, there is  no  way to do a recording extended to what we have now with low skew.	no
15112	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So  you would have a t-  completely   separate   set  up, which would mean that the  sampling  times and  so  forth would be all  over  the place compared to  this.	no
15113	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right.	no
15114	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So it would  depend  on the level of pr-  processing  you were doing  later,	no
15115	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	but if you're d- i- the  kind  of person who's doing  array  processing you actually  care  about funny little  times.	no
15116	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And - and so you  actually  wou- would want to have a  completely  different set up than we  have,  one that would go up to thirty- two  channels or something.	no
15117	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I see.	no
15118	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mmm.	no
15119	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So basically - or a hun- Yeah. So,	no
15120	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Or a  hundred  thirty-two.	no
15121	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I'm kinda skeptical, but um I think that -	no
15122	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mmm.	no
15123	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So, uh, I don't think we can share the resource in  that  way. But what we  could  do is if there was someone else who's interested they  could  have a separate set up which they wouldn't be  trying  to synch with ours which might be useful for - for  them.	no
15124	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right, I mean at least they'd have the  data  and the  transcripts,  and -	no
15125	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And then we can offer up the  room,	no
15126	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, we can o- offer the meetings, and the physical space, and - and - yeah, the transcripts, and so on.	no
15127	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right.	no
15128	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K.	no
15129	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right, I mean, just - it'd be nice if we have more information on the same	no
15130	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	data.  You know,	no
15131	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	and -	no
15132	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15133	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	But it's - if it's impossible or if it's a lot of effort then you have to just balance the two,	no
15134	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well I  thi-  yeah, the thing will be, u- u- in - in - again, in  talking  to these other people to see what - you know, what - what we can do.	no
15135	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	so -	no
15136	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right.	no
15137	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Uh, we'll see.	no
15138	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Is there an  interest  in getting  video  recordings for  these  meetings?	no
15139	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right, so we have - we -	no
15140	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I mean	no
15141	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	t-	no
15142	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yes,   absolutely.  But it's exactly the same  problem,	no
15143	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	that	no
15144	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	you have an infrastructure problem, you have a problem with people not wanting to be video taped, and you have the problem that no one who's currently involved in the  project  is really hot to  do  it.	no
15145	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Hmm.	no
15146	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So there's not enough interest to overcome all of -	no
15147	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
15148	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right.  Internally,  but I  know  there  is   interest  from other	no
15149	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	places that are interested in looking at  meeting  data and  having  the  video.  So it's just -	no
15150	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, w-  although  I - m-	no
15151	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I - I have to u- u- mention the human subjects problems,  that i- increase with video.	no
15152	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right, that's true.	no
15153	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, so it's, uh, people - people getting shy about it. There's this human subjects problem.	no
15154	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15155	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	There's the fact that then um,	no
15156	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	"if - i- I- I've  heard  comments about this  before,  ""why don't you just put  on  a video camera?"" But"	no
15157	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	"you know, it's sort of like saying, ""uh, well we're primarily interested in - in some  dialogue  things,"	no
15158	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	"uh, but, uh, why don't we just throw a microphone out there."" I mean,"	no
15159	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	the  thing  is,	no
15160	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	once you  actually  have  serious  interest in any of these things then you  actually  have to put a lot of  effort  in.	no
15161	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mmm.	no
15162	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And, uh, you  really  want to do it  right.  So I think	no
15163	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I know . Yep.	no
15164	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	NIST or L_D_C, or somebody like that I think is much better shape to do all that. We - there  will  be other meeting recordings. We won't be the only place doing meeting recordings. We are doing what we're  doing.	no
15165	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
15166	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And, uh, hopefully it'll be useful.	no
15167	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I - it - it occurred to me, has Don signed a human subject's form?	no
15168	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Oh! Probably  not.  Has Don - have you s- did you si- I thought you  did  actually. Didn't you read a digit string?	no
15169	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	A permission form?	no
15170	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I was -  Yeah, I was - I was here - I was here before once.	no
15171	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	You were here at a meeting  before.	no
15172	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	You were here at a meeting before.	no
15173	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15174	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, and you - and you signed a form.	no
15175	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So.	no
15176	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Did you sign a form?	no
15177	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Oh, I  think  so.  Did  I? I don't know.	no
15178	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I'm  pretty  sure. Well I'll - I'll get another one before the end of the  meeting.  Thank you.	no
15179	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K.	no
15180	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15181	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K.	no
15182	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15183	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15184	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	You don't - you don't have to  leave  for it. But I just - you know.	no
15185	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, we - we -	no
15186	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well I  can't,  I'm wired  in.	no
15187	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Can I verbally consent?	no
15188	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15189	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	We - we - we - we don't, uh -	no
15190	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	o-	no
15191	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	You're on recor- you're being recorded and -	no
15192	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15193	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	we don't - we don't perform electro-shock during these meetings, and -	no
15194	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I don't care. You can do whatever you want  with it . That's fine.	no
15195	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Usually.	no
15196	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15197	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K.	yes
15198	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K.	no
15199	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Uh,  transcriptions.	no
15200	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Transcriptions, O_K. Um, I thought about - there are maybe three	no
15201	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	aspects of this. So first of all, um, I've got eight transcribers.	no
15202	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Uh, seven of them are linguists.	no
15203	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	One of them is a graduate student in psychology.	no
15204	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Um,	no
15205	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Each - I gave each of them, uh, their own data set. Two of them have already  finished  the data sets.	no
15206	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And  the meetings run, you know, let's say an hour. Sometimes as man- much as an hour and a half.	no
15207	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	How big is the data set?	no
15208	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Oh, it's - what I mean is  one  meeting. Each - each person got their own meeting. I didn't want to have any conflicts of, you know, of - of	no
15209	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Ah, O_K.	no
15210	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	when to stop transcribing this one or - So I wanted to keep it	no
15211	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	clear whose data were whose, and - and -	no
15212	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Uh-huh.	no
15213	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	and so - And, uh,  meetings,  you know, I think that they're - they go as long as a -	no
15214	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	almost two hours in some - in some cases. So, you know, that means - you know, if we've got two already finished and they're working on -	no
15215	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Uh, right now all eight of them have differe- uh, uh,  additional  data sets. That means potentially as many as ten might be finished by the end of the month.	no
15216	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Hope so. But the pre-segmentation really helps a huge amount. And, uh,  also  Dan Ellis's innovation of the, uh - the multi-channel to  here  really helped a r- a lot	no
15217	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Wow.	no
15218	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K.	no
15219	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	in  terms of clearing - clearing up h- hearings that involve overlaps. But, um,	no
15220	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	just out of curiosity I asked one of  them   how long  it was  taking  her, one of these two who has already finished her  data  set. She said it takes about,	no
15221	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, sixty minutes transcription for every five minutes of real time. So it's about twelve to one, which is what we were thinking.	no
15222	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	or  Yep. It's pretty good.	no
15223	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	It's well in the range.	no
15224	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K. Uh, these  still,  when they're  finished,  um, that means that  they're  finished with  their  pass through. They still need to be edited and all but -	no
15225	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	But it's word level, speaker change, the things that were mentioned. O_K, now I wanted to mention the, um,	no
15226	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	teleconference I had with, uh, Jonathan Fiscus. We spoke for an hour and a half	no
15227	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Hmm.	no
15228	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	and, um, had an awful lot of things in common. He, um,	no
15229	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	um, he in- indicated to me that they've - that he's been,	no
15230	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, looking, uh, uh, spending a lot of time with - I'm not quite sure the connection,  but spending a lot of time with the ATLAS system.	no
15231	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And I guess that - I mean, I - I need to  read   up  on that. And there's a web site that has lots of papers. But it looks to me like that's	no
15232	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	the name that has developed for the system that Bird and Liberman developed  for the annotated  graphs approach.	no
15233	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
15234	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So what  he  wants me to do and what we - what we	no
15235	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	will  do and - uh, is to provide them with the u- already transcribed meeting	no
15236	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	for him to be able to experiment with  in  this ATLAS	no
15237	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	System. And they  do  have  some  sort of software,  at least that's  my impression, related to ATLAS and that he wants to experiment with taking  our  data and putting  them   in  that  format, and see how that works out.	no
15238	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I - I - I explained to him in - in detail the, uh, conventions that we're using  here  in this -	no
15239	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	in this word level transcript. And, um,	no
15240	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	you know, I - I explained, you know, the reasons that - that we were not	no
15241	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	coding more elaborately and - and the focus on reliability.	no
15242	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	He expressed a lot of interest in reliability. It's like he's - he's really up on these things. He's - he's very -	no
15243	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	"Um,  independently  he asked, ""well what about reliability?"" So,  he's interested in the consistency of the encoding and that sort of thing. O_K, um -"	no
15244	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Sorry, can you explain what the ATLAS - I'm not familiar with  this  ATLAS system.	no
15245	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well, you know, at this point I think -	no
15246	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Uh, well  Adam's  read more - in more detail than  I  have on this. I need to  acquaint  myself more with it. But, um,	no
15247	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	there - there is a way of viewing - Uh, whenever you have coding categories, um, and you're dealing with	no
15248	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, a taxonomy, then you can have branches that - that have	no
15249	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	alternative, uh,  choices  that you could use for each -	no
15250	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	each of them. And it just ends up looking like a graphical representation.	no
15251	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Is - is -	no
15252	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Is ATLAS the - his annotated transcription	no
15253	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	graph stuff?	no
15254	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I don't remember the acronym. The - the one - the - what I  think  you're referring to, they - they have this concept of an an- annotated transcription graph representation.	no
15255	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15256	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And that's basically what I based the format that  I  did -	no
15257	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Oh. Oh.	no
15258	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I based it on their work almost  directly,  in combination with the T_E_I stuff. And so it's  very,  very similar. And so it's - it's a	no
15259	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	data representation and a set of tools for manipulating  transcription  graphs of various types.	no
15260	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Is this the project that's sort of, uh, between, uh, NIST and - and, uh, a couple of other places? The - the -	no
15261	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
15262	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Including L_D_C.  I  think  so.	no
15263	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yep.	no
15264	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, y- right, O_K.	no
15265	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm. Then there's their web site that has lots of papers. And I looked through them and they mainly had to do with this, um,	no
15266	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	this, uh, tree structure, uh, annotated tree diagram thing.	no
15267	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mmm.	no
15268	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So, um, um - and, you know, in terms of like the conventions that  I'm  a- that  I've  adopted,	no
15269	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	it - there - there's  no  conflict at  all.	no
15270	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right.	no
15271	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	"And he was, you know, very interested. And, ""oh, and how'd you handle this?"" And I said, ""well, you know, this way"" and -"	no
15272	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And - and we had a really nice conversation.	no
15273	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Um, O_K, now I  also  wanted to say in a different - a different	no
15274	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	direction is,	no
15275	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Brian  Kingsbury.  So, um, I corresponded briefly with him. I,	no
15276	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, c- I - He still has an account here. I told him he could S_S_H on and use multi-trans, and have a look at the already done, uh, transcription. And he - and he  did.	no
15277	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And what he said was that, um, what they'll be providing is -	no
15278	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	will  not  be as fine grained in terms of the  time  information.	no
15279	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And, um, that's, uh - You know, I need to get back to him and - and, uh, you know, explore that a little bit more and see what they'll be  giving  us in specific, but I just haven't had time yet.	no
15280	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Hmm.	no
15281	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	The p- the people -	no
15282	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Sorry, what?	no
15283	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	The - the folks that they're, uh, subcontracting out the transcription to, are they like court reporters or -	no
15284	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yes.	no
15285	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Apparently  - Well, I get the sense they're kind of like that. Like it's like a pool of - of somewhat uh, secretarial -	no
15286	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I don't think that they're  court  reporters. I don't think they have the special keyboards and that - and that type of training. I - I get the sense they're more secretarial. And that, um,	no
15287	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
15288	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Hmm.	no
15289	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, what they're  doing  is giving them -	no
15290	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Like  medical  transcriptionist type people -	no
15291	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Nu- it's mostly - it's for their speech recognition	no
15292	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	products,	no
15293	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yep.	no
15294	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	that they've hired these people to do.	no
15295	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	But aren't - they're -	no
15296	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Oh, so they're hiring them, they're coming. It's not a  service  they send the tapes out  to.	no
15297	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well they - they  do  send it out but my  understanding  is that that's all  this   company  does  is transcriptions for I_B_M for their  speech  product.	no
15298	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Ah! Oh. O_K.	no
15299	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I gotcha.	no
15300	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So most of it's ViaVoice, people reading their training material for that.	no
15301	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I  see.	no
15302	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
15303	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I  see.	no
15304	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Up to now it's been  monologues,  uh, as far  my  understood. And - and what they're doing is  Brian   himself  downloaded - So -	no
15305	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yep, exactly. Yep.	no
15306	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
15307	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So, um, Adam sent them a C_D and  Brian   himself  downloaded -	no
15308	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, cuz, you know, I mean, we wanted to have it so that they were in familiar f- terms with what they wanted to  do.	no
15309	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	He downloaded	no
15310	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	from the C_D onto audio tapes. And apparently he did it	no
15311	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	one channel per  audio  tape. So each of these people is  transcribing from one channel.	no
15312	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right.	no
15313	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And then what  he's  going to do is  check  it,	no
15314	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Oh.	no
15315	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	a- before they go be- beyond the  first  one.	no
15316	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Check it and, you know, adjust it, and all that.	no
15317	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So each person gets  one  of  these   channels  -	no
15318	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right.	no
15319	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K.	no
15320	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So if they hear something off in the distance they don't - they just go -	no
15321	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well, but that's O_K, because, you know, you'll do  all  them and then  combine  them.	no
15322	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I - I don't know.	no
15323	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I have t- I, you know I -	no
15324	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	But there could be problems, right? with that.	no
15325	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yep.	no
15326	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I think it would be difficult to  do  it that way. I  really  d- uh, in  my  case -	no
15327	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15328	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well if you're tran- if you got  that  channel right  there  -	no
15329	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	No, no. We're talking about  close  talking, not the - not the  desktop.	no
15330	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15331	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	No,  close  talk.	no
15332	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Are  you?	no
15333	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yes.	no
15334	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I sure  hope  so. It'd be really  foolish  to do  otherwise.	no
15335	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well I th- I   think   so.	no
15336	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, I - I would think that it would be kind of hard to come out with - Yeah.	no
15337	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I - I think it's sort of hard just playing the - you know, just having  played  the individual	no
15338	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	files. And I - I mean, I  know  you. I know what your voice  sounds  like. I'm sort of familiar with -	no
15339	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15340	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Uh, it's pretty hard to follow, especially	no
15341	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	One side.	no
15342	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I agree.	no
15343	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	there are a lot of words that are so reduced phonetically that make sense when you know what the person was saying before.	no
15344	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, that's -	no
15345	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15346	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And  especially  since a  lot  of these -	no
15347	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Uh, it  sort  of  depends  where you are in -	no
15348	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15349	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	But I mean we had this - we've had this discussion many times. And the answer is we don't actually know the answer because we haven't tried both ways.	no
15350	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, we have.	no
15351	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well, except I can say that my transcribers use the  mixed  signal mostly	no
15352	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So.	no
15353	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
15354	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	unless there's a  huge  disparity in terms of the volume on - on the mix.	no
15355	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
15356	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right.	no
15357	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	In which case, you know, they - they wouldn't be able to catch  anything  except the prominent  channel, then they'll switch between.  But - but really -	no
15358	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right.	no
15359	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well I think that - that might change if you wanted really fine  time  markings.	no
15360	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15361	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well, O_K. Yeah, well -	no
15362	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So.	no
15363	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	But they're not  giving  f- really fine time markings.	no
15364	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right.	no
15365	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Actually, are th- so	no
15366	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	are they giving  any  time markings? In other words, if -	no
15367	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well, I have to ask him. And that's - that's my email to him. That needs to be forthcoming. But - but the, uh - I  did  want to  say  that	no
15368	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah. Cuz - O_K.	no
15369	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	it's hard to follow one channel of a conversation  even  if you  know  the people,	no
15370	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	and if you're dealing  furthermore  with  highly  abstract  network  concepts you've  never   heard  of - So, you know,  one  of these people was - was	no
15371	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	transcribing the, uh, networks group talk and she said,	no
15372	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	"""I don't really  know  what a lot of these  abbreviations  are,""   ""but I just put them in parentheses cuz that's the - that's the convention and I just"" - Cuz you know, if you don't know -"	no
15373	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Oh, I'd be curious to - to look at that.	no
15374	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Just out of curiosity, I mean -	no
15375	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	They also all have h- heavy  accents.  The networks group meetings are all -	no
15376	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15377	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15378	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15379	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Given all of the  effort  that	no
15380	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	is going on  here  in transcribing why do we have I_B_ M  doing it?	no
15381	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Why not just do it all  ourselves?	no
15382	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Um, it's historical. I mean,  uh, some point ago we thought that	no
15383	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	No, just -	no
15384	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Uh-huh.	no
15385	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	"uh, it - ""boy, we'd really have to"	no
15386	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	"ramp up to do that"", you know, like we just did,"	no
15387	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
15388	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	and, um, here's, uh, a - a, uh, collaborating institution that's volunteered to  do  it.	no
15389	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
15390	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So, that was a contribution they could make. Uh	no
15391	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
15392	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	in terms of time, money, you know? And it  still  might be a good  thing  but -	no
15393	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I'm just wondering  now  - Well, I'm - I'm wondering now if it's -	no
15394	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Actu- yeah, Mar- Mari asked me the same  question  as sort of -	no
15395	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well we can talk about more details later.	no
15396	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	um, you know, yeah,	no
15397	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15398	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	whether to -	no
15399	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15400	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, so.	no
15401	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Hmm.	no
15402	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	We'll  see. I mean, I think, th- you know, they - they - they've proceeded along a bit. Let's see what comes out of it, and - and, uh, you know, have some more discussions with them.	no
15403	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
15404	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	It's very - a real benefit having Brian involved because of his knowledge of what the - how the data need to be used and so what's useful to have in the format.	no
15405	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15406	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
15407	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15408	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So, um, Liz, with - with the S_R_I recognizer,  can it make use of	yes
15409	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	It's very - a real benefit having Brian involved because of his knowledge of what the - how the data need to be used and so what's useful to have in the format.	no
15410	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15411	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So, um, Liz, with - with the S_R_I recognizer,  can it make use of	no
15412	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	some  time marks?	no
15413	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K, so this is a, um,	no
15414	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I - I guess I  don't  know what that  means.	no
15415	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	and actually I should say this is what Don has b- uh, he's already been really helpful in, uh, chopping up these - So - so first of all you -	no
15416	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	um, I mean, for the S_R_I front-end,	no
15417	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	we really need to chop things up into pieces that are f- not too huge. Um, but second of all, uh -	no
15418	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	in  general   because   some  of these channels,  I'd say, like,	no
15419	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I don't know, at least  half  of them probably  on average are g- are ha- are -	no
15420	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	have a lot of cross-ta- sorry, some of the  segments  have a lot of  cross-talk.	no
15421	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Um, it's good to get sort of  short	no
15422	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	segments if you're gonna do recognition,  especially  forced alignment. So,	no
15423	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, Don has been taking a  first  stab actually using Jane's	no
15424	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	first - the fir- the meeting that Jane transcribed which we  did  have some problems with, and  Thilo,  uh, I think	no
15425	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	told me why this  was,  but that people were switching microphones around  in the very beginning,  so -	no
15426	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	the S_R_I re-	no
15427	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	No,  th-	no
15428	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah. No. They - they were not  switching  them but what they were - they were  adjusting  them, so.	no
15429	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	and they -	no
15430	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	They were not -	no
15431	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mmm.	no
15432	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Adjusting.   Oh.	no
15433	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	@@	no
15434	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15435	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And aft- after a  minute  or so it's - it's way  better.  So -	no
15436	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So we have to sort of normalize  the front-end and so forth, and have these small segments. So	no
15437	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yep.	no
15438	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	we've taken that and chopped it into pieces based  always  on  your  -	no
15439	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	your, um,  cuts  that you made on the  mixed  signal.	no
15440	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And so that every - every  speaker  has the same  cuts.  And if they have  speech  in it we run it through. And if they  don't  have speech in it we  don't  run it through. And we base	no
15441	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	that  knowledge  on the  transcription.	no
15442	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	On - Just on the marks. Right?	no
15443	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Um, the  problem  is if we have  no   time  marks,	no
15444	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	then for forced alignment we actually don't know where -	no
15445	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	you know, in the  signal  the transcriber  heard  that  word.  And so -	no
15446	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Oh,  I  see, it's for the  length.  I see.	no
15447	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I mean, if - if it's a whole conversation and we get a long, uh, you know,	no
15448	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	par- paragraph of - of talk, uh, I don't know how they  do  this. Um, we actually don't know which piece goes	no
15449	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I understand.	no
15450	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	where. And, um, I think with -	no
15451	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well you would need to - like a forced alignment before you did the  chopping,  right?	no
15452	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	No,  we  used  the fact that - So when  Jane  transcribes them the way she has transcribers  doing  this, whether it's with the pre-segmentation or  not,	no
15453	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	It's already chunked.	no
15454	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	they have a chunk and then they transcribes  the words  in  the chunk. And maybe they  choose  the chunk or now they use a	no
15455	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	pre-segmentation and then correct it if necessary. But there's first a chunk and then a transcription. Then a chunk, then a transcription. That's great,	no
15456	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
15457	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	cuz the recognizer can -	no
15458	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Uh, it's all pretty good sized for the recognizer also.	no
15459	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right, and it - it helps that it's made based on	no
15460	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Good. Oh good.	no
15461	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	sort of heuristics  and  human ear  I think .	no
15462	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Th- but there's going to be a real problem, uh,  even  if we chop up based on speech  silence  these,	no
15463	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, the transcripts from I_B_ M,  we  don't  actually know  where  the  words  were,  which  segment they  belonged  to. So that's sort of what I'm  worried about	no
15464	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right.	no
15465	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Why not do a -	no
15466	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	a - a forced  alignment?	no
15467	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	right now.	no
15468	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	That's what she's  saying,  is that you  can't.	no
15469	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	If you do a forced alignment on something really - well even if you do it on something really  long  you  need  to know -	no
15470	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Got uh six- sixty minutes of -	no
15471	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	you can  always  chop it  up  but you need to have a  reference  of which words went with which, uh,  chop.   So -	no
15472	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Now wasn't - I thought that one of the proposals was that I_B_M was going to do an initial forced alignment, after they -	no
15473	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, but -	no
15474	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I - I  think  that they  are,  um,	no
15475	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	We'll have to talk to Brian.	no
15476	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	yeah, I'm  sure  they  will  and so we - we have to have a dialogue with them about it. I mean, it sounds like	no
15477	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah. Maybe they have some - you know, maybe actually there  is  some, even if they're not fine  grained,  maybe the transcribers -	no
15478	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K.	no
15479	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Liz has some concerns and -	no
15480	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, I don't know, maybe it's saved  out  in  pieces  or - or  something.   That  would  help.  But,	no
15481	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15482	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, it's just an unknown right now.	no
15483	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah. I - I need to - to  write  to him. I just - you know, it's like I got over-taxed with the timing.	no
15484	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So.	no
15485	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right. But the - it  is   true  that the segments - I haven't tried the segments that Thilo gave you  but the segments that in your first meeting are  great.  I mean, that's - that's a good length.	no
15486	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
15487	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	A good size. Good.	no
15488	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well, I -  I  was thinking it would be  fun  to - to - uh, uh, if - if you - wouldn't mind,   to give us a pre-segmentation.  Uh, maybe you  have  one already of that first m- of the meeting that	no
15489	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right, cuz - y- yeah.	no
15490	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15491	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, the first transcribed meeting,  the one that I transcribed.  Do you have a - could you generate a pre-segmentation?	no
15492	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Um, I'm sure I have some but - but that's the one where we're, um, trai-  training  on, so that's a little bit -	no
15493	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	February sixteenth I think.	no
15494	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Oh.	no
15495	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Oh, I see. Oh,  darn.  Of  course,  of course, of course. Yeah, O_K.	no
15496	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	It's a little bit at odd to -	no
15497	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15498	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And actually  as  you get  transcripts  just, um, for new meetings,	no
15499	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Uh-huh.	no
15500	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	um, we can  try  - I mean,	no
15501	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	the - the more data we have to try the - the  alignments  on, um, the  better.  So it'd be	no
15502	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	good for - just to know as transcriptions are coming through the pipeline from the transcribers, just to sort of - we're playing around with sort of	no
15503	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, parameters f- on the recognizer, cuz that would be helpful.	no
15504	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
15505	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Excellent, good.	no
15506	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Especially as you get, en- more voices. The first meeting had I think just four people, yeah.	no
15507	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Four speakers, yeah.	no
15508	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
15509	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah,  Liz  and I spoke d- w- at some length on  Tuesday  and - and I - and I was planning to do just a - a preliminary look over of the two that are  finished  and then give them to you.	no
15510	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Oh, great, great.	no
15511	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15512	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So.	yes
15513	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So.	no
15514	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	That's great.	no
15515	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I guess the other thing, I - I can't remember if we discussed this in the meeting but, uh, I know you and I talked about this a little bit,	no
15516	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	there was an issue of, uh, suppose we get in the, uh, I guess it's enviable position although maybe it's just saying where the weak link is in the chain,	no
15517	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, where we - we, uh -	no
15518	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh,	no
15519	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	we have all the data transcribed and we have these transcribers and we were - we're - the -	no
15520	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	we're still a bit slow on feeding - at  that  point we've caught up and the - the - the, uh, the weak link is - is recording meetings.  O_K, um,	no
15521	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	two questions come, is you know what - how - how do we -	no
15522	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, it's not really a problem at the moment cuz we haven't  reached  that point but how do we step out the recorded  meetings?	no
15523	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And the other one is, um, uh, is there some good use that we can make of the  transcribers  to do other  things?	no
15524	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So, um, I - I can't remember how much we talked about this in this meeting but there was -	no
15525	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	We  had  spoken with them about it.	no
15526	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And there is  one  use that - that  also  we discussed which was when, uh, Dave finishes the - and maybe it's already finished - the - the	no
15527	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	modification to  multi-trans  which will allow fine grained encoding of  overlaps.	no
15528	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Uh, then it would be very - these people would be very good to shift over to finer grain encoding of overlaps. It's just a matter of, you know, providing -  So if right now you have	no
15529	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	two overlapping segments in the same  time  bin, well with - with the improvement in the  database  - in - in the, uh, sorry, in the  interface,  it'd be possible to, um,	no
15530	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	you know, just do a click and  drag  thing, and get the - uh, the specific place of  each  of those, the time tag associated with the beginning and end of - of  each  segment.	no
15531	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right, so I think we talking about three level - three things. One - one was	no
15532	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
15533	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15534	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, we had s- had  some  discussion in the past about some very  high  level	no
15535	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	The types of overlaps -	no
15536	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	labelings, types of overlaps, and so forth that - that someone could do.	no
15537	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
15538	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Second was, uh, somewhat lower level just doing these more precise timings. And the third one is - is, uh, just a completely wild hair brained idea that  I  have which is that, um, if, uh -	no
15539	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	if we have  time  and people are able to do it,	no
15540	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	to take some subset of the data and do some  very  fine grained analysis of the speech. For  instance,  uh, marking in some overlapping -	no
15541	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	potentially overlapping fashion, uh, the value of, uh, ar-  articulatory  features.	no
15542	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15543	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	You know, just sort of say, O_K, it's voiced from here to  here,  there's - it's nasal from here to  here,  and so forth. Um, as opposed to doing	no
15544	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Hmm!	no
15545	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	phonetic - uh, you know, phonemic and the phonetic analysis, and, uh,  assuming,  uh, articulatory feature values for those -	no
15546	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	those things. Um, obviously that's  extremely  time-consuming. Uh -	no
15547	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	That would be really valuable I think.	no
15548	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	but, uh, we could do it on some small subset.	no
15549	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Also if you're dealing with consonants that would be easier than vowels, wouldn't it? I mean, I would think that -	no
15550	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	that, uh, being able to code that there's a - a  fricative  extending from here to here would be a lot easier than classifying precisely which  vowel  that was.	no
15551	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Which one.	no
15552	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mmm.	no
15553	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I think vowels - vowels are I think  harder.	no
15554	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
15555	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah .	no
15556	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well,  yeah,  but I think  also  it's just the issue that - that when you look at the - u- w- u- u- when you look at Switchboard for instance	no
15557	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
15558	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	very close up there are places where whether it's a  consonant  or a  vowel  you  still  have trouble  calling  it a particular  phone	no
15559	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm, O_K. Yeah, I'm sure. Uh, yeah, I - I know.	no
15560	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, but - but just saying what the -	no
15561	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	at that point because it's - you know, there's this movement from here to here and - and - and it's -	no
15562	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right.	no
15563	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	You're saying r- sort of remove the high level constraints and go bottom-up.	no
15564	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	so I-	no
15565	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yep, just  features.	no
15566	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, describe - describe it. Now I'm suggesting articulatory features. Maybe there's - there's even a  better  way to do it but it - but -	no
15567	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Then just say -	no
15568	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mmm.	no
15569	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	but that's, you know, sort of a traditional way of describing these things,	no
15570	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
15571	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	um, and -	no
15572	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, I mean, actually this might be a g- neat thing to talk to -	no
15573	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	That's nice.	no
15574	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Acoustic  features versus  psychological  categories. Yeah.	no
15575	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Sort of. I mean, it's still -	no
15576	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15577	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	some sort of categories but - but something that allows for overlapping	no
15578	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	change of these things and then this would give some more	no
15579	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	ground work for people who were building statistical models that  allowed  for overlapping changes, different timing changes as opposed to just	no
15580	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	"""click, you're now in this state, which corresponds to this speech sound"" and so on."	no
15581	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.	no
15582	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So this is like gestural - uh, these g- Right.	no
15583	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, something like that. I mean, actually if we get into that it might be good to, uh, uh, haul	no
15584	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K.	no
15585	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	John Ohala into this and ask his - his views on it I think.	no
15586	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15587	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right.	no
15588	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	But is - is the  goal  there to have this on  meeting  data, like	no
15589	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Excellent.	no
15590	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	so that you can do  far  field studies  of those gestures or -	no
15591	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	um,	no
15592	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	or is it because you think there's a different kind of actual  production  in meetings  that people use? Or - ?	no
15593	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	No, I think - I think it's - for - for - for  that  purpose I'm just	no
15594	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	viewing meetings as being a - a neat way to get people talking naturally.	no
15595	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And then you have i- and then - and then it's natural in  all  senses, in the sense that you have microphones that are at a distance that	no
15596	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Just a source of data?	no
15597	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I  see.	no
15598	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	you know, one might have,  and  you have the close mikes, and you have people talking naturally. And the overlap is just indicative of the fact that people are talking  naturally,  right? So -	no
15599	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Uh-huh.	no
15600	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15601	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right.	no
15602	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15603	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	so I think that given that it's that kind of corpus, if it's gonna be a very useful corpus	no
15604	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	um, if you say w- O_K, we've limited the use by some of our, uh, uh,  censored  choices,	no
15605	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	we don't have the video, we don't - and so forth,	no
15606	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	but there's a  lot  of use that we could make of it by expanding the  annotation  choices.	no
15607	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
15608	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And, uh, most of the things we've talked about have been fairly  high  level, and	no
15609	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	being kind of a bottom-up person I thought maybe we'd,  do some of the others. Yeah.	no
15610	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Hmm.	no
15611	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	It's a nice balance. That would be really nice to offer those things with that  wide  range. Really nice.	no
15612	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right. Yeah, that would be good.	no
15613	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right.	no
15614	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah and  hopefully  someone would make use of it. I mean, people didn't -	no
15615	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15616	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, I mean, people have made a  lot  of use of - of  TIMIT  and, uh w- due to  its  markings, and then  the Switchboard transcription thing,  well  I think has been very useful for a lot of people. So -	no
15617	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right.	no
15618	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	That's true.	yes
15619	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, I mean, people have made a  lot  of use of - of  TIMIT  and, uh w- due to  its  markings, and then  the Switchboard transcription thing,  well  I think has been very useful for a lot of people. So -	no
15620	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	That's true.	no
15621	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I guess I wanted to, um,	no
15622	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Cool.	no
15623	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	sort of make a pitch for trying to  collect  more meetings.  Um,	no
15624	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15625	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I- actually I talked to Chuck Fillmore and I think they've	no
15626	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	what, vehemently said no  before  but this time he wasn't vehement and he said	no
15627	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15628	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	"you know, ""well, Liz, come to the meeting tomorrow and try to  convince  people"". So I'm gonna  try. Go to their meeting tomorrow and see"	no
15629	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
15630	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	if we can try, uh, to convince them because they have -	no
15631	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Good.	no
15632	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Cuz they have something like three or four different meetings, right?	no
15633	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And they have very interesting meetings from the point of view of	no
15634	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
15635	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	a very different  type  of - of  talk  than we have here and  definitely  than the front  end  meeting, probably.	no
15636	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Talk -	no
15637	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Um -	no
15638	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	You mean in terms of the  topic  -  topics?	no
15639	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well, yes and in terms of the -	no
15640	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	the fact that they're describing  abstract  things  and, uh, just dialogue-wise, right.	no
15641	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
15642	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
15643	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Um, so I'll try. And then the  other  thing is,	no
15644	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I don't know if this is at all useful, but I asked  Lila  if I can	no
15645	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	maybe go around and talk to the different	no
15646	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	departments in this building	no
15647	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yes.	no
15648	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	to see if there's any groups that, for a free lunch, if we can still  offer  that,  might be willing -	no
15649	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	You mean non-ICSI?	no
15650	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Great.	no
15651	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	non-ICSI, non-academic, you know, like government people, I don't know. So.	no
15652	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, I guess you - you can  try  but -	no
15653	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	The  problem  is  so  much of their stuff is confidential.	no
15654	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	It would be  very  hard for them.	no
15655	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15656	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15657	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Also it  does  seem like it takes us  way  out of the  demographic.  I mean, it seems like we - we had this idea before of having like linguistics students brought down for free lunches and that's a nice idea.	no
15658	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15659	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Is -  is  it  in  these departments?	no
15660	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well, tha- I think that's her point.	no
15661	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right, and then we could also - we might try advertising again because I think it'd be good if - if we can get a few different	no
15662	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15663	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	sort of non-internal types of meetings and just also more data.	no
15664	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15665	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And I think, uh, if we could get -	no
15666	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
15667	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Does - does John Ohala have weekly phonetics lab meetings?	no
15668	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So.	no
15669	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	"So I actually wrote to him and he answered, ""great, that sounds really interesting"". But I never heard back because we didn't actually advertise  openly.  We a-"	no
15670	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I mean w-	no
15671	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I told - I d- asked him  privately.	no
15672	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Um, and it  is  a little bit of a trek for campus   folks.	no
15673	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15674	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
15675	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	You  might  give  them   a free lunch. But, um,	no
15676	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Um, so it's still worthwhile.	no
15677	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	it would be  nice  if we got someone other than  me  who knew how to set it up and could do the recording so u- I didn't have to	no
15678	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So -	no
15679	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Exactly,  and - and -	no
15680	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	do it each time.	no
15681	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah. That's right.	no
15682	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	and I was thinking -	no
15683	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	He- he's supposed - he's supposed to be trained  to do it.	no
15684	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15685	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Plus  we could also get	no
15686	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K, next  week   you're going to do it all.	no
15687	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15688	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	you know, a s- a student. And I'm willing to try to learn. I mean, I'm -	no
15689	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I would do my best.	no
15690	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Um, the  other  thing is that -	no
15691	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	It's not that hard.	no
15692	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	there was a number of things at the transcription side	no
15693	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	that, um,	no
15694	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	transcribers can do, like dialogue act tagging,  disfluency tagging, um,	no
15695	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	things that are in the speech that are actually	no
15696	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	something we're y-  working on for  language  modeling. And Mari's also interested in it, Andreas as well. So if you wanna	no
15697	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	"process a utterance and the first thing they say is, ""well"", and that ""well"" is coded as some kind of interrupt"	no
15698	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	u-	no
15699	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	tag. Uh, and things like that, um,	no
15700	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Of course  some  of that can be li- done lexically. And I also - they  are  doing  disfluency  tagging	no
15701	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	th-	no
15702	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	A lot of it can be done -	no
15703	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	to some degree  already.  Yeah.	no
15704	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Great.  So a - a lot of this kind of -	no
15705	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I think there's a second pass and I don't really know what would exist in it. But there's definitely a second pass worth	no
15706	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
15707	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	doing to maybe encode some kinds of, you know, is it a question or not, or -	no
15708	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	um, that maybe these transcribers could do.	no
15709	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So -	no
15710	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	They'd be really good. They're - they're very - they're very consistent. Uh, I wanted to - whi- while we're - Uh, so, to return just  briefly  to this question of more  meeting  data, um -	no
15711	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15712	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
15713	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	That'd be great.	no
15714	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I have  two  questions. One of them is, um, Jerry Feldman's group, they - they, uh, are they -	no
15715	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I know that they recorded  one  meeting. Are they willing?	no
15716	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I think they're open to it. I think, you know,  all  these things are - I think there's -	no
15717	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Oh, yeah.	no
15718	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	we should go beyond, uh, ICSI but, I mean, there's a  lot  of stuff happening at ICSI that we're not getting now that we could.	no
15719	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
15720	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So it's just - Yeah. So the -	no
15721	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	"Oh, that we  could.  O_K. I  thought  that all these people had sort of said ""no""  twice  already. If that's not the case then -"	no
15722	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	No, no. No. So th- there was the  thing  in Fillmore's group but even  there  he hadn't -	no
15723	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	"What he'd said "" no "" to was for the main  meeting.  But they have several  smaller  meetings a  week,"	no
15724	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So.	no
15725	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	and, uh, the notion was raised before that that could happen. And it just, you know - it just didn't come  together  but -	no
15726	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Just - O_K.	no
15727	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	"Well, and - and the  other  thing  too  is when they  originally  said ""no"" they didn't know about this post-editing"	no
15728	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	capability thing.	no
15729	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Oh.	no
15730	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right.	no
15731	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.  Yeah.	no
15732	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right. That was a big	no
15733	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	That's important.	no
15734	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So.	no
15735	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	fear.	no
15736	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, so I mean there's possibilities there.  I think  Jerry's  group, yes. Uh, there's - there's, uh, the  networks  group, uh, I don't - Do they still meeting regularly or - ?	no
15737	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K.	no
15738	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well, I don't know if they  meet  regularly or not but they are no longer  recording.	no
15739	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	But I mean, ha- ha- have they said they don't  want  to anymore or - ?	no
15740	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Um, ugh,  what  was his name?	no
15741	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Uh, i- i-	no
15742	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Joe Sokol?	no
15743	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15744	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15745	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	When - with him gone,	no
15746	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	it sorta trickled  off.  They - and they stopped -	no
15747	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K, so they're  down  to three or four  people  but the thing is three or four  people  is O_K.	no
15748	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15749	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
15750	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yep.	no
15751	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	We might be able to get the administration -	no
15752	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well he was sort of my  contact,  so I just need to find out who's  running  it now. So.	no
15753	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K.	no
15754	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I see that Lila has a luncheon meeting in here periodically. I don't know -	no
15755	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, I mean, it -  One  thing that would be nice and this - it sounds  bizarre  but,	no
15756	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I'd really like to look at - to get  some  meetings where there's a little bit of heated discussion, like ar- arguments and - or emotion, and things like that.	no
15757	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	"And so I was thinking if there's any like Berkeley  political  groups or something. I mean, that'd be  perfect.  Some group, ""yes, we must -"""	no
15758	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Who's willing to get recorded and distributed?	no
15759	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well, you know, something - Um -	no
15760	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, I don't think the more political argumentative ones would be willing to -	no
15761	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15762	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, with - with - with potential use from the defense department. Yeah.	no
15763	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15764	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well, O_K. No, but maybe stu-  student,  uh, groups or, um,  film-makers,  or som-  Something  a little bit	no
15765	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15766	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.  Exactly.	no
15767	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15768	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15769	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15770	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, of course there  is  this  problem  though, that if we give them the chance to excise  later  we e-  might end up with like five minutes out of a f-	no
15771	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15772	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Film-maker.	no
15773	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	colorful.	no
15774	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Of beeps, yeah.	no
15775	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	of m- one hour of -	no
15776	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15777	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15778	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Is -	no
15779	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yes.  Really.	no
15780	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And I don't mean that they're angry but just something with some more variation in prosodic contours and so forth would be neat. So if anyone has ideas,	no
15781	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I'm willing to do the leg work to go try to talk to people but I don't really know which groups are worth	no
15782	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well there  was  this K_P_F_ A  idea, but -	no
15783	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	pursuing.	no
15784	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	No that's -	no
15785	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, th- there's a  problem  there in terms of, uh, the	no
15786	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K.	no
15787	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Legal.	no
15788	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	um	no
15789	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	commercial value of - of st- uh, it - it - it - it turned out to be a bit of a problem.	no
15790	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K, O_K.	no
15791	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And I had one other - one other aspect of this which is, um, uh, uh, Jonathan Fiscus expressed	no
15792	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Or -	no
15793	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	primar- uh y- a  major  interest in having	no
15794	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	meetings which were all English speakers. Now he wasn't trying to shape us in terms of what we  gather  but	no
15795	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
15796	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	that's what he wanted me to  show  him.	no
15797	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So I'm giving him our, um - our initial  meeting  because he asked for all  English.  And I think we don't  have  a lot of all English meetings right now.	no
15798	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Did he mean, uh - did he mean and non-British?	no
15799	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Of all - all nat- all native speakers.	no
15800	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well -	no
15801	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	The all native.	no
15802	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	That's what I mean, yeah.	no
15803	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well if he meant and non- British  I think we have  zero.	no
15804	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	He doesn't care. No. Eh, well,  British  is O_K.	no
15805	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	But - but -	no
15806	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	He said British was O_K?	no
15807	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Sure, sure, sure. Yeah.	no
15808	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	British is English?	no
15809	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Why?	no
15810	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Different varieties of English.	no
15811	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Ooo, ooo.	no
15812	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well, I don't - I don't - I don't think - if he didn't say that -	no
15813	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Native speaking. Native speaking English.	no
15814	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I bet he meant native speaking American.	no
15815	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yes.	no
15816	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I  bet  he  did.	no
15817	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	American English?	no
15818	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Oh,  really.	no
15819	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So, why would he care?	no
15820	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Knowing the application -	no
15821	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I remember wh- I- I remember a study -	no
15822	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	That's -	no
15823	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	English,	no
15824	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I was thinking,  knowing  the, uh, n- National Institute of Standards, it  is   all  -	no
15825	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I remember a study that B_B_N did where they trained on - this was in Wall Street Journal days or something,  they  trained  on American English and then they  tested  on, uh, different native speakers from different areas.	no
15826	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And, uh,	no
15827	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, the  worst  match was people whose native tongue was Mandarin Chinese.	no
15828	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	The  second  worst was British English.	no
15829	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	That's funny.	no
15830	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So h- it's, you know, t-	no
15831	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Alright. And so that would make sense. I didn't have the context of that.	no
15832	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	the - the - the -  German  was much better, it was  Swiss  w-  Yeah, so it's - so I think, you know, if he's - if he's thinking in terms of recognition kind of technology I - I - I think he would probably want, uh	no
15833	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Ooo, ooo.	no
15834	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	American English, yeah. It - it - yeah, unless we're gonna train with a whole bunch of -	no
15835	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I wonder if we have  any.	no
15836	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	All America, O_K.	no
15837	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I think that the -  Feldman's  meetings tend to be more that way, aren't they? I mean, I sort of feel like they have -	no
15838	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Maybe.  Maybe.	no
15839	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I think so, yeah.	no
15840	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, mm-hmm.	no
15841	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15842	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mmm.	no
15843	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And maybe there are a few of - with us where it was - you know, Dan wasn't there and before Jose started coming, and -	no
15844	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15845	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15846	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15847	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	It's pretty  tough,  uh, this group. Yeah. So, uh, what about - what about people who involved in some  artistic  endeavor? I mean, film-making or something like that. You'd think like they would be -	no
15848	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	God.	no
15849	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15850	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mmm.	no
15851	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15852	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	A film-maker.	no
15853	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Exactly, that's what I was - something where there - there is actually discussion where there's no right or wrong answer but -	no
15854	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	but it's a matter of opinion kind of thing.	no
15855	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	It's be fun.	no
15856	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Uh,  anyway,  if you - if you have ideas -	no
15857	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	RASTA. P_L_P. RASTA. P_L_P.	no
15858	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	We  can just discu-  we  can just have a political  discussion  one day.	no
15859	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yes.	no
15860	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	A- any department that calls itself  science  ri-	no
15861	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, we could -	no
15862	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Department. Yeah.	no
15863	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Uh,  I  could make that pretty -	no
15864	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well, like computer science. That -	no
15865	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Computer sci-	no
15866	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	We could get Julia Child.	no
15867	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I know.	no
15868	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	That's  -	no
15869	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I'm - I'm actually serious because, uh, you know, we have the set up here and - and that - that has	no
15870	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Got a ticket.	no
15871	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, I know you are.	no
15872	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	a chance to give us some very interesting fun data. So if anyone has ideas,	no
15873	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15874	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15875	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	if you know any groups that are m- you know,	no
15876	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well I had  asked  some - some of the students at the  business  school. I could -	no
15877	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15878	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I know -	no
15879	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	student groups c- like  clubs,  things like  that.   Not  -  not  -	no
15880	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	"Put a little ad up saying, ""come here and argue""."	no
15881	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	"Yeah. ""If you're really angry at someone use our conference room."""	no
15882	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	The Business school.	no
15883	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Uh, the  business  school might be good. I actually spoke with some students up there and they - they - they expressed willingness back when they thought they would be doing more stuff with  speech.	no
15884	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Oh, O_K.	no
15885	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Really.	no
15886	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	But when they lost interest in speech they also	no
15887	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	stopped answering my email about  other  stuff, so.	no
15888	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Hmm.	no
15889	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I -	no
15890	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Or people who are really h-	no
15891	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	They could have a discussion about te-	no
15892	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	We should probably bleep that out.	no
15893	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	about - about tax cuts or something.	no
15894	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I  heard  that at Cal Tech they have a special room - someone said that they had a special room to get all your frustrations out that you can go to and like throw things and break things.	no
15895	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So we can like post a -	no
15896	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, now  that  is not actually what we -	no
15897	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Th-  that's  not what we want.	no
15898	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	No, not to that extent but, um.	no
15899	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well, far field mikes can pick up where they threw stuff on the wall.	no
15900	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15901	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, but we don't want them to throw the far field  mikes  is the thing.	no
15902	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	That's right.	no
15903	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15904	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Oh.  Yeah, right.	no
15905	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	The fa-	no
15906	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	""" Please  throw everything in  that  direction."""	no
15907	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	b- b-	no
15908	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.  Anyway.	no
15909	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Padded cell.	no
15910	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	It'd be fun to get like a - a p- visit from the -	no
15911	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	There was a  dorm  room at Tech that, uh, someone had coated the walls and the ceiling, and, uh, the floor with mattresses.	no
15912	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mmm.	no
15913	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	The entire  room.	no
15914	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I had as my  fourth  thing here processing of wave forms. What did we mean by that? Remember  @@ ?	yes
15915	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	The entire  room.	no
15916	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I had as my  fourth  thing here processing of wave forms. What did we mean by that? Remember  @@ ?	no
15917	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15918	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Uh, Liz wanted to talk about	no
15919	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Pre-processing.	no
15920	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	methods of improving accuracy by doing pre-processing.	no
15921	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well I think that - that was just sort of - I- I already asked  Thilo  but	no
15922	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Oh, you already did that.	no
15923	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	that, um, it would be helpful if I can stay in the loop somehow with,	no
15924	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	um, people who are doing any kind of  post-processing,  whether it's	no
15925	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	to  separate  speakers or to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, or  both,	no
15926	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	um, that we can sort of  try  out as we're running recognition.	no
15927	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Um, so, i- is that - Who  else  is work- I guess Dan Ellis and you	no
15928	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Dan, yeah.	no
15929	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yep.	no
15930	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, and Dave uh  Gel- Gelbart again, he's - he's interested in - in fact we're look- starting to look at some echo cancellation kind of things.	no
15931	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	and Dave.	no
15932	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yep.	no
15933	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15934	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K.	no
15935	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K.  Right .	no
15936	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Which uh -	no
15937	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I am not sure how much that's	no
15938	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	an issue with the close talking mikes, but who knows?	no
15939	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Hmm?	no
15940	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well, let's - w- i- isn't that what - what you want -	no
15941	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	t-	no
15942	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I  don't know. I'm  bad  -  It's like -   like -	no
15943	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	No, so - No, i- w- wha- what you - what you want - when you're saying improving the wave form you want the close talking microphone to be better. Right?	no
15944	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right.	no
15945	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And the question is to w- to what extent is it getting hurt	no
15946	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	by, uh - by any room acoustics or is it just - uh, given that it's close it's not a  problem?	no
15947	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Uh -	no
15948	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	It doesn't  seem  like big room acoustics problems to my ear but I'm not an expert. It seems like a problem with  cross-talk.	no
15949	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K, so it's -	no
15950	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	e- I bet with the  lapel  mike there's plenty, uh, room acoustic but I-	no
15951	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah .	no
15952	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	That - that may be true. But I don't know how  good  it can  get  either by those - the - those methods -  That's true.	no
15953	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I think the rest is cross-talk.	no
15954	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15955	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K.	no
15956	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So I - I think it's just,	no
15957	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Oh, I don't know.	no
15958	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	yeah, what you said,  cross-talk.	no
15959	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	All I meant is just that as sort of -	no
15960	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	as this pipeline of research is going on we're also experimenting with different	no
15961	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	A_S_R, uh, techniques. And so it'd be w-  good  to  know  about it.	no
15962	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
15963	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So the problem is like, uh, on the microphone of somebody who's  not  talking they're picking up	no
15964	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	signals from  other  people  and that's	no
15965	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	R- right, although if they're  not   talking,  using the -	no
15966	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	causing problems?	no
15967	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	the  inhouse  transcriptions, were sort of O_ K  because	no
15968	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	the t- no one transcribed any  words  there and we throw it out.	no
15969	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
15970	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	"But if they're talking at all and they're not talking the whole time,  so you get some speech and then a ""mm-hmm"", and some more speech, so that whole thing is one chunk."	no
15971	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And the person in the middle who said only a  little  bit is picking up the speech  around  it,	no
15972	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	that's  where it's a big  problem.	no
15973	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	You know, this  does  like seem like it would relate to some of what  Jose's  been working on as  well,  the encoding of the -  And - and he also, he was -	no
15974	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15975	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	The energy, right. Exactly.	no
15976	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, energy.	no
15977	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I was t- I was trying to remember, you have this  interface  where you - i- you ha- you showed us one time on your  laptop  that you - you had different visual displays as speech and nonspeech events.	no
15978	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, c- Yeah. May - I - I  only  display the different  colors  for the different situation.	no
15979	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	But, eh, for me and for my problems, is uh - is enough.	no
15980	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Because, eh, it's possible, eh,	no
15981	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	eh, in a simp- sample view, uh, to, nnn, to  compare  with c- with the segment, the - the kind of  assessment	no
15982	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	what happened with the - the different parameters. And	no
15983	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	only with a different bands of color for the,	no
15984	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, few situation, eh, I consider for acoustic event is enough to  @@ . I -	no
15985	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
15986	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	I -  I see that, eh,	no
15987	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	you are considering now, eh, a very sophisticated, eh, ehm, eh,	no
15988	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	@@	no
15989	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	set of, eh, graphic s- eh, eh, ehm, si- symbols to - to transcribe. No?	no
15990	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Oh, I w- Uh-huh.	no
15991	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Because, uh,  before,  you - you are talking about the - the possibility to include in the Transcriber program eh, um, a set of symbols, of graphic symbol to -	no
15992	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	t- to  mark  the different situations  during the transcription - during the  transcription . No?	no
15993	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well, you're saying - So, uh, symbols for differences between laugh, and  sigh,  and - and - and slam the door and stuff? Or some  other  kind of thing?	no
15994	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15995	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah, yeah. The s- the symbols, you - you talk of  before.  No? To - to mark -	no
15996	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well,  I  wouldn't say   symbols  so much.  The - the  main  change that I - that  I  see in the  interface  is - is just that we'll be able to more finely c- uh,	no
15997	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
15998	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	time  things. But I - I  also  st- there was another aspect of your work that I was  thinking  about when I was talking to you which is that it  sounded	no
15999	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
16000	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Hmm.	no
16001	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	to me, Liz, as though you - and, uh, maybe I didn't q- understand this,  but it  sounded  to me as though  part  of the analysis that  you're  doing involves taking  segments  which are of a  particular  type and putting them  together.	no
16002	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And th- so if you have like a p- a s- you know, speech from  one  speaker,  then you cut out the part that's not that speaker, and you	no
16003	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
16004	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
16005	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	combine segments from  that  same  speaker to -  and run  them   through the recognizer. Is that  right?	no
16006	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Well we  try  to find as close	no
16007	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	of start and end time of - as we  can  to the speech from an individual speaker,	no
16008	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
16009	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	because then we - we're more guaranteed that the recognizer will - for the  forced  alignment which is just to give us the  time  boundaries,	no
16010	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	because from those  time  boundaries then the plan is to compute prosodic features.	no
16011	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
16012	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	And the sort of  more  space you have that  isn't  the thing you're trying to  align  the more	no
16013	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	errors  we have.	no
16014	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
16015	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Um, so, you know, that - that - it would  help  to have	no
16016	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Cuz i- O_K.	no
16017	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	either  pre-processing of a signal that creates  very  good signal-to-noise ratio, which I don't know how possible this  is  for the lapel,	no
16018	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	um,  or  to have very -	no
16019	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	to have  closer,   um,	no
16020	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	time - you know,  synch  times, basically, around the  speech  that gets  transcribed  in it, or  both.  And it's just sort of a open world right now of	no
16021	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	exploring  that. So I just wanted to  see, you know, on the  transcribing  end from  here  things look  good.	no
16022	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Uh, the I_B_M one is more - it's an open  question  right now. And then the issue of	no
16023	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	like  global  processing of some signal and then,	no
16024	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	you know, before we chop it  up  is - is yet  another  way we can improve things in that.	no
16025	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	What about increasing the flexibility of the  alignment?	no
16026	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_K.	no
16027	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Do you remember that thing that Michael  Finka  did? that experiment he did a while back?	no
16028	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
16029	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right. You can, um -	no
16030	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Hhh.	no
16031	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	The  problem  is just that the  acoustic  - when the signal-to-noise ratio is too  low,  um,	no
16032	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	you - you'll get, a- uh - an alignment with the wrong duration pattern or it -	no
16033	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Oh, so  that's  the problem, is the - the signal-to-noise ratio.	no
16034	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah. It's  not  the fact that you have like - I mean, what  he  did is allow you to have,	no
16035	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, words that were in another  segment  move over to the - at the  edges  of - of segmentations.	no
16036	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
16037	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Or even words inserted that weren't - weren't there.	no
16038	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Right, things - things near the boundaries where if you got your  alignment  wrong - cuz what they had done  there  is align and then  chop.	no
16039	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
16040	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Mm-hmm.	no
16041	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Um, and this problem is a little bit j- more  global.  It's that there are problems even in-  inside  the alignments,	no
16042	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, because of the fact that there's enough acoustic	no
16043	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	signal  there t- for the recognizer to - to  eat,   as part of a word. And it  tends  to do that. S-	no
16044	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
16045	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	So, uh,	no
16046	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	but we probably  will  have to do something like that in addition.	no
16047	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Anyway.  So, yeah, bottom - bottom line is just I wanted to make sure I can	no
16048	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	be aware of whoever's working on these  signal-processing  techniques for,	no
16049	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	Yeah.	no
16050	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	uh, detecting energies, because that - that'll really help us.	no
16051	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_ K,  uh	yes
16052	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	O_ K,  uh	no
16053	transcript	transcript_Bmr011	tea has started out there I suggest we c- run through our digits and,	no

16227	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Uh.  Alright. So. I  uh	no
16228	transcript	transcript_Bro015	uh wanted to mention a couple little bits of news.	no
16229	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Um Hynek is supposed to come for a couple days next week.	no
16230	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Don't know which days yet.  So hopefully he'll have some intensive time to - to work with people.	no
16231	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Um.  The second thing is that um	no
16232	transcript	transcript_Bro015	we're starting to talk about maybe having Sunil come here uh for some chunk of the summer.	no
16233	transcript	transcript_Bro015	So that may or may not happen but  if he does since actually Pratibha is going to be off at I_B_M  um  the  uh effort will pretty much	no
16234	transcript	transcript_Bro015	shift  here,	no
16235	transcript	transcript_Bro015	cuz Sunil will be here and  other people are working on other things I think. So.	no
16236	transcript	transcript_Bro015	So.	no
16237	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Uh.	no
16238	transcript	transcript_Bro015	That's my news.	no
16239	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Alright.	no
16240	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Cool. I need a  new  office mate.	no
16241	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Oh, O_K.	no
16242	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Yeah.	no
16243	transcript	transcript_Bro015	That's cool.	no
16244	transcript	transcript_Bro015	There you go.	no
16245	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Right.	no
16246	transcript	transcript_Bro015	It will be some- sometime in summer. July or August, or.	no
16247	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Yeah, I mean it may not happen. I mean he wants - uh I think he wants some experience someplace else and he's - he's uh  thinking of going  someplace,  but it's - I mean Pratibha is getting her experience going to I_B_M and he may come  here.  So.	no
16248	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Mm-hmm.	no
16249	transcript	transcript_Bro015	But y- I don't know maybe June.  Maybe earlier. But uh.  Anyway,  Hynek will be here next week and maybe he'll know more about it.	no
16250	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Oh yeah.  Well, the news	yes
16251	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Oh yeah.  Well, the news	no
16252	transcript	transcript_Bro015	more specifically t- for Aurora um	no
16253	transcript	transcript_Bro015	So I guess there was again a  conference call but	no
16254	transcript	transcript_Bro015	uh they are not decide on  everything yet.	no
16255	transcript	transcript_Bro015	For the V_A_D they - probably they will do something like  having some kind of idealized V_A_D that they could  run on the channel zero	no
16256	transcript	transcript_Bro015	of the SpeechDat-Car  and then take the same um end points	no
16257	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Mm-hmm.	no
16258	transcript	transcript_Bro015	and apply them on channel one so it's -	no
16259	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Oh so take a  real  V_A_D but apply it to - to - to the clean -	no
16260	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Uh g-	no
16261	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Yeah, to the  clean  and take the end points for the  noisy.  Mmm.	no
16262	transcript	transcript_Bro015	clean data.  O_K.	no
16263	transcript	transcript_Bro015	But I am not sure this is decided yet. Um.	no
16264	transcript	transcript_Bro015	And - and i- when they're talking about it, do you have the impression that they're talking about	no
16265	transcript	transcript_Bro015	a  particular V_A_D which everybody would  use?  or - or just that everybody would use the same  procedure?	no
16266	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Well , probably uh s- the same V_A_D  for everybody.	no
16267	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Mm-hmm.	no
16268	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Um.	no
16269	transcript	transcript_Bro015	So they would just provide that as part of the data.	no
16270	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Maybe.  But this is still -	no
16271	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Yeah. Sounds like they're still arguing. Yeah.	no
16272	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Yeah, they're still  not decided.	no
16273	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Yeah.	no
16274	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Yeah.	no
16275	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Um I don't know what -	no
16276	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Yeah.	no
16277	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Nothing much. Yeah. Probably the um -	no
16278	transcript	transcript_Bro015	these weight things, they will	no
16279	transcript	transcript_Bro015	apply the same kind of weighting scheme for	no
16280	transcript	transcript_Bro015	T_I-digits than for the SpeechDat-Car.	no
16281	transcript	transcript_Bro015	So it would be weighting of  um -	no
16282	transcript	transcript_Bro015	It would be an average of improvements rather than an average of  word error rates which would make  the more clean	no
16283	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Mm-hmm.	no
16284	transcript	transcript_Bro015	parts of T_I-digits more important than they are right now.	no
16285	transcript	transcript_Bro015	O_K.	no
16286	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Uh but it sounds like none of this is really decided, that this is how things are leaning and -	no
16287	transcript	transcript_Bro015	This	no
16288	transcript	transcript_Bro015	They - they t- I think they will tend to go this way, but hmm.  Uh.	no
16289	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Yeah, if we have the result for the tandem with um M_S_G also	no
16290	transcript	transcript_Bro015	So  @@   it was t-	no
16291	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Yeah there is no surpri- there is no surprise. Well,	no
16292	transcript	transcript_Bro015	so there is  nor  significant improvement.	no
16293	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Um.	no
16294	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Yeah, basically that's all.	no
16295	transcript	transcript_Bro015	We've started to work on some kind of report for the work  so we've not much	no
16296	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Mm-hmm.	no
16297	transcript	transcript_Bro015	more results. Hmm.	no
16298	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Yeah you have a uh - you have a lunch talk sometime in -  When is it?	no
16299	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Mm-hmm.	no
16300	transcript	transcript_Bro015	It's next week, yeah.	no
16301	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Next week? Oh, O_K.	no
16302	transcript	transcript_Bro015	How about the um - the thing that you guys were working on before the uh	no
16303	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Uh  voiced-unvoiced uh -	no
16304	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Oh yes. But,	no
16305	transcript	transcript_Bro015	no. This week I'm -  I am begin to - to write the report on -	no
16306	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Ah.	no
16307	transcript	transcript_Bro015	I stopped it. Interfered. Yeah.	no
16308	transcript	transcript_Bro015	You stopped working on it I see	no
16309	transcript	transcript_Bro015	O_K. Uh.	no
16310	transcript	transcript_Bro015	So it sounds like basically things are slowing down a bit? And - and - and trying to	no
16311	transcript	transcript_Bro015	collate results? and  get something from it?	no
16312	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Mm-hmm.  Yeah.	no
16313	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Yeah.	no
16314	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Um. Yeah. Right now, Sunil seems i- is in India actually.  Uh so  there is no progress apparently from their side neither.	no
16315	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Right.	no
16316	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Right. But that sort of puts it on us to do it. But.	no
16317	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Um. And -	no
16318	transcript	transcript_Bro015	I'm sorry?	no
16319	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Kind of puts it on us to put more in, then,  really.	no
16320	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Yeah.	no
16321	transcript	transcript_Bro015	I mean. Uh. Who's - who's - was uh looking at the combination of uh spectral s- subtraction approaches with what we had for instance.	no
16322	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Sunil was  working on this.	no
16323	transcript	transcript_Bro015	O_K.	no
16324	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Um.	no
16325	transcript	transcript_Bro015	He sent a bunch of - a bunch of results uh but I don't know what's the status of this. I  guess  it was just the result that he sent, so.  Um.	no
16326	transcript	transcript_Bro015	What was that again?	no
16327	transcript	transcript_Bro015	He just used the spectral subtraction and the L_D_A filters I guess	no
16328	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Mm-hmm.	no
16329	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Mmm.	no
16330	transcript	transcript_Bro015	And -	no
16331	transcript	transcript_Bro015	And it was not	no
16332	transcript	transcript_Bro015	better than what we had before.	no
16333	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Then he tried to put the on-line normalization and	no
16334	transcript	transcript_Bro015	it did not improve further, putting the on-line normalization, so.	no
16335	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Um.	no
16336	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Yeah.	no
16337	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Hmm.	no
16338	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Huh.	no
16339	transcript	transcript_Bro015	O_K. Well -	no
16340	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Hmm.	no
16341	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Yeah. I - uh, I g- so I guess nothing has ever happened about uh making a standardized uh place where the software sits so that people can work with it, and  upgrade it?	no
16342	transcript	transcript_Bro015	No. Well, I - I sent mails to start the - the process and I guess we should have to -	no
16343	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Well, we know most what we have to - to put in - in this.  And.	no
16344	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Yeah.	no
16345	transcript	transcript_Bro015	So, I guess. Yeah, we m-	no
16346	transcript	transcript_Bro015	O_K.	no
16347	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Well, uh. Let's - let's come back to this uh later.	no
16348	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Um.  O_K.	no
16349	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Um.  Chuck, did you get a chance to do anymore stuff with the uh	no
16350	transcript	transcript_Bro015	No. I didn't. Um, are you talking about -	no
16351	transcript	transcript_Bro015	H_T_K, or - ?	no
16352	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Uh, no. This week I haven't. I've been - my whole time's been taken up with uh  Meeting Recorder stuff.	no
16353	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Uh, disk crash and uh	no
16354	transcript	transcript_Bro015	O_K.	no
16355	transcript	transcript_Bro015	u-	no
16356	transcript	transcript_Bro015	O_K.	no
16357	transcript	transcript_Bro015	covering things.	no
16358	transcript	transcript_Bro015	This may be a very short meeting. Uh.   Um.	no
16359	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Anything from	no
16360	transcript	transcript_Bro015	your side?	no
16361	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Uh, continuing readings  we come	no
16362	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Uh. We're doing some background reading on phonetics.	no
16363	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Uh-huh.	no
16364	transcript	transcript_Bro015	O_K.  Dave?	yes
16365	transcript	transcript_Bro015	O_K.  Dave?	no
16366	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Yeah.	no
16367	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Well um.	no
16368	transcript	transcript_Bro015	One thing in - in the paper Avendano and his collaborators wrote  is that - is that um  they tried doing channel normalization on the reverberant in speech by um	no
16369	transcript	transcript_Bro015	subtracting the mean of the log spectral magnitude  over a two second window. But they didn't do anything with the phase,	no
16370	transcript	transcript_Bro015	and they said perhaps that limited their approach that it did not try to normalize the phase in any way.	no
16371	transcript	transcript_Bro015	So I'm - I'm going to start thinking about  um ways that the ph- that the phase could be used.	no
16372	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Um. Si- if - if the um channel  and the reverberation is multiplicative in the frequency domain with the speech spectrum then the  phases should be additive.	no
16373	transcript	transcript_Bro015	So um perhaps just subtracting the mean of the phase would - would help.	no
16374	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Um but I don't know I th- I get the impression that they tried to do some things with the phase and they weren't successful.	no
16375	transcript	transcript_Bro015	O_K.	no
16376	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Oh. You know, there  is  one other thing. Um Stephane showed me a paper yesterday  um	yes
16377	transcript	transcript_Bro015	O_K.	no
16378	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Oh. You know, there  is  one other thing. Um Stephane showed me a paper yesterday  um	no
16379	transcript	transcript_Bro015	where th- uh for the Italian system they had done a series of experiments playing around with the um -  the number of iterations, that I talked about last week?  And, um, so, there was a whole series of those that they had done. They didn't, I don't think, reported timing  for those, but um	no
16380	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Mm-hmm.	no
16381	transcript	transcript_Bro015	it turns out that the one that they're actually using was not the best, uh in - in their series of experiments, which I uh - Maybe it's because they  uh wanted to use the same number of iterations across all different languages and this was only done on Italian or something.	no
16382	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Sure. Wh- who's  they   - they?	no
16383	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Uh, I don't know  who  did it do you know, Stephane? Who did that?	no
16384	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Um.	no
16385	transcript	transcript_Bro015	I don't know but it's the company who prepared the Italian database, so it was - Is it Alcatel, or - ?	no
16386	transcript	transcript_Bro015	I  think  so.	no
16387	transcript	transcript_Bro015	I -	no
16388	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Mmm.	no
16389	transcript	transcript_Bro015	I don't know.	no
16390	transcript	transcript_Bro015	So um  you know there wasn't a huge difference in terms of the performance across all the different experiments that they did.  Um. But it varied a little bit.  And uh - So I guess the main thing that I take out of that is that I think that for our purposes here we could definitely  you know decrease the number of iterations that we do  and um, at least while we're, you know, working on uh	no
16391	transcript	transcript_Bro015	all different of kinds of variations, and that would let us, you know, pump through a lot more experiments.  So um I still have to - to send everybody a	no
16392	transcript	transcript_Bro015	pointer about uh  how to run the um  H_T_K system  on the Linux boxes and about changing these number of iterations so that -	no
16393	transcript	transcript_Bro015	so that you can do that.  Um.  So the - the other thing that that I was thinking about maybe trying out next is um -	no
16394	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Oh!	no
16395	transcript	transcript_Bro015	The other th- the other experiment that they had in that paper was uh uh playing with the number of Gaussians per state.	no
16396	transcript	transcript_Bro015	And so.	no
16397	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Uh.	no
16398	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Mm-hmm.	no
16399	transcript	transcript_Bro015	I think it's - was playing with the number of states per word. They had sixteen, seventeen, eighteen.	no
16400	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Yeah, because it was around - between sixteen and twenty or -	no
16401	transcript	transcript_Bro015	O_K. I should look at that more carefully cuz I wonder	no
16402	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Yeah.	no
16403	transcript	transcript_Bro015	what	no
16404	transcript	transcript_Bro015	they did about -	no
16405	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Oh, O_K. I was thinking it was Gaussians but it's states. O_K.	no
16406	transcript	transcript_Bro015	So, and -	no
16407	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Yeah, apparently,	no
16408	transcript	transcript_Bro015	um  they had better results when they increased the number of states.	no
16409	transcript	transcript_Bro015	From - from eighteen to twenty, or -	no
16410	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Mm-hmm.	no
16411	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Yeah.	no
16412	transcript	transcript_Bro015	So.  The thing I was thinking about was uh, you know, the number of insertions really goes up when you  start adding all the noise in, and maybe the thing to do next would be to try to um	no
16413	transcript	transcript_Bro015	uh make the silence model more powerful, you know, increasing the number of Gaussians to the number of states, different - different things like that, so.  That's probably the next little thing I'll play with when I get a chance	no
16414	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Um.	no
16415	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Let's see.	yes
16416	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Let's see.	no
16417	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Um.	no
16418	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Why don't - why don't we uh - if there aren't any other major things, why don't we do the digits, and then - then uh turn the mikes off.	no
16419	transcript	transcript_Bro015	So I'll start.	no
16420	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Uh.	no
16421	transcript	transcript_Bro015	Uh I got transcript uh L_ six four	no

17046	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	The  crazy  thing is we'd have to	no
17047	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Oh.	no
17048	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	convert  the s-	no
17049	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	we'd have to  dump  the audio files onto  cassette.	no
17050	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	to use it.	no
17051	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Oh,  I  see.	no
17052	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	O_K.	no
17053	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I mean, given that we've already	no
17054	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	got them  digitally	no
17055	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	it would be -	no
17056	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	you know, it's quite  tempting  to use some kind of uh  software  thing.	no
17057	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Oh, O_K.	no
17058	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	But - but then there's the  question  of the ergonomic  interface,  that -	no
17059	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I kn-	no
17060	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Oh,	no
17061	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I  actually   have  some  foot  pedals for the P_ C.	no
17062	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Well, that's what I was gonna  say,  is	no
17063	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	that Adam has  foot  pedals that we could  probably  try and  rig  something up to -	no
17064	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	O_K.	no
17065	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Oh, that'd be  super.	no
17066	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	What do they  connect  to?	no
17067	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Uh, keyboard.	no
17068	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	and they generate  keystrokes.	no
17069	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Oh, that's  totally   cool.	no
17070	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	now how - how do you -	no
17071	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	how do you decide which  keystrokes  they generate?	no
17072	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Um	no
17073	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	There's a little  program  that downloads  into  it.	no
17074	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Hmm.	no
17075	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	This  is great.	no
17076	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Um.	no
17077	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	And this is  Windows?	no
17078	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	But the  program   probably  only runs in Windows, although I bet we could	no
17079	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	program it  once	no
17080	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Uh-huh.	no
17081	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	And -	no
17082	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	and then put it on  another   machine  and it would  work.	no
17083	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Except for the fact that we would have to unplug it and pow- and	no
17084	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I  haven't   used  them.	no
17085	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	change - it w-	no
17086	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Does it lose the memory	no
17087	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	once you've unpowered it?	no
17088	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I don't know.	no
17089	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I don't  think  it does.	no
17090	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	So  hang  on. You have -	no
17091	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	You  have  these foot pedals but you d- you're not  using  them.	no
17092	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I'm not  using  them anymore. I  used  to use them.	no
17093	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	So they're  currently  set up	no
17094	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	for  Shift,   Control,  and  Alt.	no
17095	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Yeah.	no
17096	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	But I r- I don't  use  them.  They're not even plugged  in.	no
17097	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Wow.	no
17098	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	That's so  cool.	no
17099	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	O_K.	no
17100	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	This sounds  wonderful.	no
17101	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	And so tha- uh if that would  help,  uh I'm  certainly  willing to  donate  them.	no
17102	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Well,	no
17103	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I'm - I'm open to -	no
17104	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	the d- the - well, the uh	no
17105	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	The part that's  not  wonderful is someone has to  write  the  software.	no
17106	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Right.	no
17107	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Yeah, that's  true.	no
17108	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	And it - it  is  a P_C connection, so it would have to go on a P_ C  somewhere.	no
17109	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Well,	no
17110	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	you know -	no
17111	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Yeah.	no
17112	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Now, we're at a  pilot  phase right now, and  what I was told is that	no
17113	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Mm-hmm.	no
17114	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	beginning,	no
17115	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	you know,	no
17116	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	that the - the pilot data would be something like half hour of uh - or f-	no
17117	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	you know -	no
17118	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	half hour to forty minutes of running text.	no
17119	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	And so,  for the  pilot  thing,	no
17120	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	you know, of  course  this would be  useful.	no
17121	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Right, this  is  the pilot data.	no
17122	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	And I w- I wou- I'm assu-	no
17123	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I'm  assuming  that I would not be	no
17124	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Yeah,  yeah,  you are   generating  it.	no
17125	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	uh	no
17126	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	you know	no
17127	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	e- eh uh	no
17128	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	transcribing  all  of it.	no
17129	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	So,	no
17130	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Well, that - that was part of the  question,  is that if,	no
17131	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	for -	no
17132	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Right.	no
17133	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	if we're doing this  regularly  - Imagine we're doing a couple of hours a week of  transcripts	no
17134	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Yeah.	no
17135	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	um, of  recording,	no
17136	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	uh, I  wouldn't  expect you to do it  all.	no
17137	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	No.	no
17138	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	No, no.	no
17139	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	So the question is do you know of  resources  that we could  use.	no
17140	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	So are there  grad  students or  undergrads  or just	no
17141	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Yes.	no
17142	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Mm-hmm, yeah, O_K, so now I've -	no
17143	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	commercial services?	no
17144	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I've been involved with some of that.	no
17145	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	At - at CogSci,	no
17146	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	um -	no
17147	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	So,  Susan   E-	no
17148	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Susan Ervin-Tripp,	no
17149	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	who you know	no
17150	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	um would typically, and I've done this too, supervise undergrads	no
17151	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Hmm.	no
17152	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	to	no
17153	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	do this kind of thing	no
17154	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	and they c-	no
17155	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	you know,	no
17156	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	you can give  them   like -	no
17157	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	if you give  them   a little bit of instruction and -	no
17158	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	and make it  interesting  for  them	no
17159	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	they can do it as a two ninety-eight or s-	no
17160	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	or,  not  two ninety-eight, what is it, one- whatever,	no
17161	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	undergraduate research credit.	no
17162	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Because what you do is, you can -	no
17163	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Mm-hmm.	no
17164	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Oh, really?	no
17165	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	So we  only  have to give them  credits,	no
17166	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	you know, build it into some sort of a -	no
17167	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	We  don't  have to give them  money?	no
17168	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Well uh, you have to be sure you give them compensation for - you know.	no
17169	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Oh, you  do  have to pay them.	no
17170	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	of some - of  some  sort. What I mean is it's not necessarily  monetary.	no
17171	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Awesome .	no
17172	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	But if they feel like they're getting something  out  of it,	no
17173	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Mm-hmm.	no
17174	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	sometimes you can do it  that  way.	no
17175	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Mm-hmm.	no
17176	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	And otherwise, as part of a grant,	no
17177	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	you can -	no
17178	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	you can do it.	no
17179	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	some sort of	no
17180	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	minimal	no
17181	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Yeah.	no
17182	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	wage.	no
17183	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Well, we - we need to -	no
17184	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	We  need to find out how much that will cost, so I can  pass  that on to Morgan,	no
17185	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Yeah.	no
17186	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	cuz right now we have almost no money.	no
17187	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Yeah, O_K.	no
17188	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	So - so the  cheaper  we can do it, the  better.	no
17189	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Well, -	no
17190	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	O_K.	no
17191	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Well, you  also  want to get  quality.	no
17192	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I mean,  someone's  going to have to pass through -	no
17193	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Yeah, absolutely.	no
17194	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Either a  higher  level person will have to pass through, or you have to be sure you get	no
17195	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Mm-hmm.	no
17196	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	good quality	no
17197	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Right.	no
17198	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	to  begin  with.	no
17199	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	But um,	no
17200	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	yeah, that's quite -	no
17201	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	you know - we've -	no
17202	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	That's been	no
17203	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	done.	no
17204	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I can ask Susan Ervin-Tripp	no
17205	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Yeah.	no
17206	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	what she would recommend on that. She's really -	no
17207	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	She's done -	no
17208	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Of the people that I know, she's the one who's supervised the most of those things locally.	no
17209	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Mm-hmm.	no
17210	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	What's her name?	no
17211	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Uh	no
17212	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	uh Doctor Susan Ervin-Tripp.	no
17213	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	O_K.	no
17214	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	faculty member in Psychology, recently retired,	no
17215	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Uh-huh.	no
17216	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	So -	no
17217	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	and very well known in discourse analysis.	no
17218	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Oh,  O_K . So, the p-	no
17219	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I mean, what I'm	no
17220	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	hearing  is that	no
17221	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	the	no
17222	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	problem  of starting off with some recordings and trying to get word transcripts	no
17223	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	is kind of -	no
17224	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I mean, it's not a - it's not an unfamiliar problem.	no
17225	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	So that -	no
17226	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Oh, it's  very  common.	no
17227	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	So that I mean that basically,	no
17228	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Yeah.	no
17229	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	there are  standard  solutions and we should just adopt -	no
17230	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	adopt  them and it's going to  cost  however much it's going to  cost,	no
17231	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I mean there's -	no
17232	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	We're - we're  probably   not  going to have a lot of  flexibility  in	no
17233	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	bringing  down  the cost cuz probably	no
17234	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	the low cost solution's already been  established.	no
17235	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	And so that's just whatever it is.	no
17236	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Mm-hmm.	no
17237	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	That's	no
17238	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	how we'll do it.	no
17239	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	See what I mean?	no
17240	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I think there's  always  this question of the  trade-off  between uh	no
17241	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	paying  more for the first pass,	no
17242	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Mm-hmm.	no
17243	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	and then h-	no
17244	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	and then  editing  less  later.	no
17245	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Uh-huh.	no
17246	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	or	no
17247	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	paying  less  the first pass and editing  more  later. So	no
17248	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Yeah.	no
17249	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Well,	no
17250	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	whatever they -	no
17251	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	people who have had to do this -	no
17252	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I mean the only thing is	no
17253	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I wonder if  our  requirements are  different  from um -	no
17254	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I mean there's - than -	no
17255	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	than what's been done in the past	no
17256	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	than discourse analyzers	no
17257	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	because	no
17258	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	maybe we have different requirements in terms of time align-	no
17259	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	you know, how much  time   aligned detail we need	no
17260	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	and uh how much detail in terms of people.	no
17261	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Oh,	no
17262	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	But that's a s-	no
17263	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Mm-hmm. O_K.	no
17264	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I don- I don't know how much ti- I don't think we  do  need any time aligned detail.	no
17265	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I think we just have	no
17266	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	basically one text file which runs from beginning to end.	no
17267	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	But.	no
17268	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Well, if - in terms of  transcripts,  sure, but in terms of  speaker  change it might be	no
17269	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	nice to get the actual	no
17270	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	time.	no
17271	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Sure.	no
17272	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	But not if it  costs  more.	no
17273	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Right.	no
17274	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Well, O_K. So what  happened  with  Switchboard	no
17275	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	was	no
17276	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	at least,	no
17277	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I mean, the  output	no
17278	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	was that they had	no
17279	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	speaker  turns	no
17280	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	and they	no
17281	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	um	no
17282	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	analyzed it in terms of,	no
17283	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	"you know, "" this  is where this speaker change came in"""	no
17284	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	and of course that gets really	no
17285	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	difficult when you're talking about - I mean, this is some of the stuff that you were	no
17286	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Mm-hmm.	no
17287	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	talking about in	no
17288	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	uh	no
17289	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	your lunch talk, is that - is that	no
17290	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Right.	no
17291	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	you know, you get backchannels and stuff like that, that	no
17292	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	that,	no
17293	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	you know, disrupt the	no
17294	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	um	no
17295	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	the	no
17296	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Yeah.	no
17297	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	segment- you know the	no
17298	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	segmentation.	no
17299	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Right,  I mean,	no
17300	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	the - it's sort of it's - a little -	no
17301	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	In some sense it's a little bit easier with it - with	no
17302	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Switchboard  because the telephone is so -	no
17303	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	actually people	no
17304	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	are less flexible in what they do. In this kind of situation where	no
17305	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	we've got	no
17306	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	nonverbal	no
17307	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	channels	no
17308	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	then  there's a lot of overlap	no
17309	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	and there's just that it's not a very good model.	no
17310	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Right.	no
17311	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Oh,	no
17312	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	in terms of  data  format, what are we going to  do  about that?	no
17313	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I mean,	no
17314	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	you have the  S_T_  M  format, where you have	no
17315	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	you know, every  phrase,  every  utterance  is - is	no
17316	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	a single speaker.	no
17317	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I mean, is  that  the  right  way to  do  it? Or -	no
17318	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Well,	no
17319	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	every utterance is a single  speaker,  right?	no
17320	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	It's just that utterances can  overlap.	no
17321	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I mean,	no
17322	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Is that the right way to do it?	no
17323	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I  think so.	no
17324	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I think - I think - I mean, I think when I'm - when -	no
17325	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	O_K.	no
17326	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Like, So,  Eric  made a s- made a sentence,	no
17327	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	and that should be like one	no
17328	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	utterance	no
17329	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	and then  I  had a couple of backchannels  in  there	no
17330	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	and they should be just overlapping  things  that -	no
17331	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I don't think that we should  break  Eric's sentences for  those.  I think -	no
17332	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	O_K. So that means that for each  utterance,  we'll need the time marks,	no
17333	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Right.	no
17334	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	the start and end of each  utterance.	no
17335	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Yeah.	no
17336	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	So.	no
17337	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	So -	no
17338	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Well, we'll have to  go  in from  somewhere	no
17339	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	but we can't necessarily -	no
17340	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I mean, we - we  may  be able to get the  transcriber  to give them to us	no
17341	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	if we	no
17342	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	give them  software	no
17343	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	but	no
17344	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	we may  not	no
17345	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	in which case we'll have to get them	no
17346	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	some  other  way, like with forced alignment  later,  I mean	no
17347	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	you know all this  can  be  done.	no
17348	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Mm-hmm.	no
17349	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	So we - maybe we should look at the um -	no
17350	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	the tools that Mississippi State has.	no
17351	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Yeah.	no
17352	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Because, I d- I - I know that they published	no

17424	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	a- a- is this -	no
17425	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	So, we're talking now,	no
17426	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	once you have words	no

17428	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	and that's.	no
17429	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Oh. So, these are p-  particularly  for time alignment?	no
17430	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Well, these are uh tools -	no
17431	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	So, MATE and EAGLES are both within the so-called	no

17437	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Right.	no
17438	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	So.	no
17439	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	They -	no
17440	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Right.  - are they just for time alignment or are they for	no
17441	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Can I be excused,	no
17442	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	transcription as well?	no
17443	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	and I'll go down and get my stuff?	no
17444	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	because um I - I do think -	no
17445	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	You don't -  Just take the thing with you.	no

17455	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Sure.	no
17456	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	O_K. And I go get my books and I'll be right back.	no
17457	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I didn't think of bringing this.	no

17471	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	So,	no
17472	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I-	no
17473	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	For the  digits  -	no
17474	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	For the d-	no
17475	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I assume that these are projects where they do the whole thing, right?	no
17476	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Right.	no
17477	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	So they probably  will  have tools to address the actual	no
17478	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Oops.	no
17479	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	the - the - the  transcriber  support  and   then  automated alignment of what the transcribers give you, which is, you know,  exactly  the problem we have. So.	no
17480	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Mm-hmm.	no
17481	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Right, but  we  can do automated alignment.  That's  not a problem	no
17482	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	O_K	no
17483	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Right.	no
17484	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I think	no
17485	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Right.	no
17486	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	But then again we don't  have  to do it.	no
17487	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	and -	no
17488	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Well, I'm not  sure  if we can do automated alignment or  not.	no
17489	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I mean,	no
17490	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	e- especially in e- with  speaker  change in a meeting like this, where we're  overlapping  so much, I don't think we're gonna have a -	no
17491	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I th-	no
17492	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	a  prayer.	no
17493	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Oh  sure,  we are. We've got individual  microphones.	no
17494	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Well, to get -	no
17495	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	to get the r- to get the actual transcript, I think	no
17496	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	we'll do O_K because of -	no
17497	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	because of the separate channels.	no
17498	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Oh,  that's  true. Right. We could just do it through  these.	no
17499	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Right.	no
17500	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Yeah.	no
17501	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I hadn't even  thought  about that.  Sure.	no
17502	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Um.	no
17503	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	In terms of  data  formats, uh	no
17504	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	what I  did  for the  Digits  stuff was just	no
17505	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	to  hand-rolled  my  own.	no
17506	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	That  looks like this  form.	no
17507	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	You know, it's  just  uh  something  that's  easy  to  parse  in  Perl.	no
17508	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Um.	no
17509	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Probably  for	no
17510	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	the  full  one, we'll want to do  something   like  S_T_ M.	no
17511	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I mean, some format that our tools already  work  with.	no
17512	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Yeah.	no
17513	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Well,	no
17514	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Yes,	no

17517	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	we'll have  several  formats that you can interconvert between.	no
17518	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	When we want to do recognition we'll do S_T_M, but	no
17519	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Right.	no
17520	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Yeah, presumably.	no
17521	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	if we're -	no
17522	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	rather than - rather than designing our own format,	no
17523	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	we'll just take whatever	no
17524	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	comes out of the tools that we can find to use, I think.	no

17889	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	somewhere,	no
17890	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	with like	no
17891	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	O_K.	no
17892	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	lists and lists and lists of uh	no
17893	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Yes.	no
17894	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	various and assorted tools.	no
17895	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Well there's -	no
17896	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	They have a special project, as I'm remembering,	no
17897	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Mm-hmm.	no
17898	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	and um, usually it doesn't deal with much that has to do with discourse,	no
17899	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	but they uh -	no
17900	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	they show up in	no
17901	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	resources.	no
17902	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	So,	no
17903	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Um,	no
17904	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	"we'll start with "" Transcriber "" and if it looks like that's  not  gonna"	no
17905	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	do  what we need,	no
17906	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	we'll  move on to the Mississippi State and if it doesn't look like  that's  going to work,	no
17907	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	we'll look at  something    else.	no
17908	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I like that very much, and I- and I like the idea of also doing one that's tied in with	no
17909	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	O_K.	no
17910	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	these larger corp-  corpus projects. So that, you know, the fact that,	no

17912	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Mmm.	no
17913	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Yeah.	no

17915	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Yeah.	no
17916	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Right.	no
17917	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Also, I  wanted  to mention just in  passing  that	no
17918	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	uh  another  thing that we're going to want to start  collecting  is  queries  for the  meetings.	no
17919	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	So if  over  the  next  couple of days you find yourself wondering what we  talked  about in the  meeting,	no
17920	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	write   down  the sort of  query  you'd like to  make.	no
17921	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Oh,  good   idea.	no
17922	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Do you  understand  what I  mean?	no
17923	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Mm-hmm.	no
17924	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	It's like the P_D_A thing.	no
17925	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	So,	no
17926	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	imagine  that we  had   Meeting  Recorder all  done,	no
17927	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	and you  had  one,	no
17928	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	what  might you do	no
17929	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	with  it?	no
17930	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	So,	no
17931	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	if they  occur  to you.	no

17948	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	That's a fine question.	no
17949	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	if anyone wants to know.	no
17950	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Wow.	no

17961	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Yeah, there you go.	no
17962	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	They're actually, they seem to be more	no
17963	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Exactly.	no
17964	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	the tool- the main focus of the tools is	no
17965	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	you've already got a transcription but you're trying to tag the different turns	no
17966	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	transi- transcriptions with uh	no
17967	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	discourse roles	no
17968	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I see.	no
17969	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	and things like that.	no
17970	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	But I mean a lot them are tools that will also do transcription as well.	no
17971	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	And I could be wrong.	no
17972	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Well, my-  my  impression- I - I -	no
17973	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I really thought of these resources in the context of you -	no
17974	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	you asking about	no
17975	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	time aligning the - you know, What would you need to indicate	no
17976	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Right.	no
17977	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	and were there tools for that because	no
17978	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	um	no
17979	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I suspect that  would  be	no
17980	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	uh pretty	no
17981	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	time intensive.	no
17982	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I also wanted to say, in terms of like	no
17983	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	disc-	no
17984	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	you know, if there are discussions about intonation contours	no
17985	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I  do  have	no
17986	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	a certain amount of  background  in that and I really would be -	no
17987	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Right.	no
17988	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I'd like to be  involved  in that.	no
17989	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	No, right, I didn't mean to imply that	no
17990	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Yeah.	no
17991	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	that we -	no
17992	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	that - that we shouldn't discuss this  now,  but I'm -	no
17993	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I'm just saying that -	no
17994	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Oh, not right now, but I mean in the  future.  So at this meeting with Liz	no
17995	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Right.	no
17996	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I - you know, I mean -	no
17997	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Right.	no
17998	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I - I  do  -	no
17999	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I'd like to -	no
18000	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I like that stuff.	no
18001	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Sure, sure.	no
18002	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	So, when is she showing up?	no
18003	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Well,	no
18004	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I mean, they're coming in April.	no
18005	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	April. O_K.	no
18006	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Right.	no
18007	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	But,	no
18008	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	um	no
18009	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	You know, we - we may or may not	no
18010	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	talk before then	no
18011	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Mm-hmm.	no
18012	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	on that.	no
18013	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Um.	no
18014	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I - I think we won't	no
18015	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	probably talk until we have more data, I would think.	no
18016	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Right?	no
18017	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Right, since we have	no
18018	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	almost   none  right now,	no
18019	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	let's	no
18020	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Yeah.	no
18021	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	We need to move  forward  from  there.	yes
18022	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	We need to move  forward  from  there.	no
18023	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	But uh,  yeah,   I  guess it's O_ K.	no
18024	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	And then, uh	no
18025	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	there's  also  just the  general  question of  will it handle multiple  channels  or should we just -	no
18026	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Dan and I spoke about this  briefly,	no
18027	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	do we want to try to  combine  channels somehow	no
18028	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	to make the transcriber's job  easier?	no
18029	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I was  listening  to some of it and uh	no
18030	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	like, if you  just   listen  to the  far	no
18031	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	P_Z_ M	no
18032	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	the person sitting at  this  end of the table you can hardly hear at  all.	no
18033	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	on - on the transcript, so there may be -	no
18034	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	it may be worthwhile to at least	no
18035	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	try a  little  bit	no
18036	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	to  combine  the channels.	no
18037	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Right.	no
18038	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I -	no
18039	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Uh, the stuff  I  did, I combined pairs of these into stereo pairs, listened to them in  stereo.	no
18040	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	And I was very impressed by how	no
18041	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Huh. Neat!	no
18042	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	well you could hear	no
18043	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	separate speakers, but I haven't -	no
18044	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I haven't done very extensive tests.	no
18045	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Oh, so,  that  would be	no
18046	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	interesting as  well  to do that.	no
18047	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Oh!	no
18048	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Yeah, cuz you'd get	no
18049	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	you get -	no
18050	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	you get a certain amount of spatial information.	no
18051	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Right!	no
18052	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	It's not - It's not consistent but it's -	no
18053	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Well, I bet if you used	no
18054	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Wow.	no
18055	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Gives you some	no
18056	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	this  one -	no
18057	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	noise -	no
18058	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	the  two  s- most  separated  P_Z_ Ms  -	no
18059	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Well,  maybe, maybe not.	no
18060	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Yeah, yeah, you'd get - get wide coverage.	no
18061	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Well, you would - you would - sound like you'd have like in this e- big	no
18062	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Big ears.	no
18063	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Right. Right.	no
18064	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	But I mean - But you would -  you would - You know, you'd get	no
18065	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	big head.	no
18066	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	good -	no
18067	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	You'd get good  pick  up at both ends of the  table.	no
18068	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Right.	no
18069	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Right.	no
18070	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	So.	no
18071	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Right.	no
18072	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	O_K, do we have  anything  else to talk about with  transcribes?	yes
18073	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	O_K, do we have  anything  else to talk about with  transcribes?	no
18074	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Well, what is - what is the goal?	no
18075	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	again?	no
18076	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	We're going to end up with  some  -	no
18077	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I mean,  ultimately,  we're going to end up with	no
18078	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	transcriptions  of these  meetings.	no
18079	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	And we'll run a -	no
18080	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	train a neural net	no
18081	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	and	no
18082	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	create a recognizer and	no
18083	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	do	no
18084	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	What, and then -	no
18085	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Then -	no
18086	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	information retrieval and -	no
18087	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Then we'll be done, huh?	no
18088	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Well, that's  my  interest.	no
18089	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I mean,  other  people have different  interests,  so.	no
18090	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Um.	no
18091	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	That's what  I  want.	no
18092	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Of course, there are different kinds of recos-	no
18093	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	so we're going to actually train a recognizer based on these	no
18094	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	uh, far-field mikes  cuz what we - that's the problem we're trying to solve.	no
18095	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Right.	no
18096	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Right.	no
18097	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	O_K.	no
18098	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	We need a lot of - I mean -	no
18099	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Well, what - the -	no
18100	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	so, the  reason  we're doing near field as  well  is if that doesn't  work  we wanna back-	no
18101	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	we want some -	no
18102	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Well -	no
18103	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	and also the near field will allow us to do the  time  alignment accurately.	no
18104	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	something that will work.	no
18105	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Right.	no
18106	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Right.	no
18107	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Um.	no
18108	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	So these are near - near field?	no
18109	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Mm-hmm.	no
18110	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	there	no
18111	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Yeah. Yeah.  Close mikes.	no
18112	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	O_K.	no
18113	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I mean I - yeah, I feel like -	no
18114	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	that - What we're actually going to  do  with these data is	no
18115	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	very  unclear to me	no
18116	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Why?	no
18117	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Well, because I  don't  think that's a -	no
18118	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Y-	no
18119	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	That's   not  going to work. Right? O_K. We're going to get  horrible   performance  on that.	no

18172	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	pursue  it,	no
18173	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	but	no
18174	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	um	no
18175	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	we've got a  huge  problem, because if we ge- if we want train a recognizer we need  tens  of  hours  of labeled data.	no
18176	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Oh, good point.	no
18177	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	And um	no
18178	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	it's just eh - it's very frightening.	no
18179	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Yep.	no
18180	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Do you think -	no
18181	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	So, are - are you familiar with this	no
18182	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	the MARS- the MARSEC project?	no
18183	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	uh-uh	no
18184	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Um,	no
18185	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	So,	no
18186	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I'll put this over here, cuz he seems to be the chairman.	no
18187	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Um.	no
18188	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Who?	no
18189	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Who, Eric?	no
18190	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Oh, he's  not?	no
18191	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	No.	no
18192	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	He has - he has the open piece of paper.	no
18193	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Well	no
18194	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Uh-huh.	no
18195	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	So,	no
18196	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	open notebook.	no
18197	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	He - Yeah.	no
18198	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Well, he can -	no
18199	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	y- y-	no
18200	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Well, Dan's got an open notebook, too.	no
18201	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	discuss - discuss among yourselves.	no
18202	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Outrageous!	no
18203	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Laying out his  folders.	no
18204	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I  have  one but I've carefully  covered  it so that it doesn't -	no
18205	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Right.	no
18206	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	So, this is a project that um	no
18207	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	has	no
18208	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	time-aligned spoken	no
18209	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	data which is um -	no
18210	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I see it as sort of  in - between	no
18211	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	um	no
18212	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	these  fields	no
18213	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	because a lot of the time when people do	no
18214	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	rich um	no
18215	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	intonational and - and stress-oriented transcription	no
18216	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	they	no
18217	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	don't have the	no
18218	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	digital	no
18219	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	record	no
18220	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	at the same time and the don't have it time-aligned.	no
18221	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Mm-hmm.	no
18222	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I  don't  know how large this  is,  actually.	no
18223	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	But I just	no
18224	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	was sort of thinking that um	no
18225	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I'm - I'm - and it's British	no
18226	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Mm-hmm.	no
18227	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	And you know	no
18228	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Well, I  think  to  some  extent with things like	no
18229	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	So.	no
18230	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	the  stress  and the other prosodic	no
18231	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Uh-huh.	no
18232	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	things an- and  tighter   time  alignments that we can  do	no
18233	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I think	no
18234	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	we should  probably   do  those	no
18235	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Mm-hmm.	no
18236	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	but  only  once we have a consumer of that data	no
18237	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	O_K.	no
18238	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	You know, so  right  now we  have  a  consumer  of	no
18239	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	the  word  transcripts and the	no
18240	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	speaker  change.  Me.  I  want  those things to work.	no
18241	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Mm-hmm.	no
18242	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	And so I would  like  to get that done as quickly as  possible.	no
18243	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Mm-hmm.	no
18244	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	And so,  if -	no
18245	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I'm d-	no
18246	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Mm-hmm.	no
18247	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	if  Liz  or someone  else  wants  to do some work on	no
18248	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	uh	no
18249	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	prosody  and on  stress  and so on	no
18250	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	then	no
18251	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	we can go  back  to the data and generate the	no
18252	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	uh the transcripts that we need.	no
18253	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	O_K.	no
18254	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	One thing about that is that is that	no
18255	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	um	no
18256	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	in the process of -	no
18257	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	of	no
18258	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	doing the word level?	no
18259	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	it really  is  just as easy to put the stress in at that point.	no
18260	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	simply the stressed -	no
18261	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Even for an undergrad?	no
18262	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Oh, oh, well, see	no
18263	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	in my pilot	no
18264	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	stuff, so in the half hour or so that I'm doing.	no
18265	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I'd just as soon put it in,	no
18266	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Mm-hmm.	no
18267	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	because I  do  think that you'd find that those would be  words  -	no
18268	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	O_K.	no
18269	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I mean -	no
18270	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	You know of course,  Rosaria's	no
18271	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	pursuing this - this  area	no
18272	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Mm-hmm.	no
18273	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	but I  really   do  think	no
18274	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	from  everything  that  I've  run across that um	no
18275	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	you -	no
18276	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	you  should  get  gain	no
18277	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	in terms of the	no
18278	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	uh	no
18279	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	uh	no
18280	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	what you were saying, the	no
18281	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Right.	no
18282	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	information retrieval aspects from that.	no
18283	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	And I wouldn't be too surprised - I mean, it's - it's like uh	no
18284	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I mean I don't know how - how reliable  Lea  is,	no
18285	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	but  if  this idea of islands of - of um	no
18286	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	for di- whatever they	no
18287	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	are. r-	no
18288	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	r- islands of reliability or whatever it is.	no
18289	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Accuracy?	no
18290	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	The stressed w-  stressed  words.	no
18291	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Certainty, islands of certainty.	no
18292	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Is that it?	no
18293	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	O_K.	no
18294	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Yeah.	no
18295	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I mean	no
18296	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Are you certain?	no
18297	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Lea?	no
18298	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	No.	no
18299	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	The claim that	no
18300	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	uh words that get  stressed	no
18301	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	are easier to recognize.	no
18302	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I  see.	no
18303	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	So,	no
18304	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Yeah.	no
18305	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I mean, I -	no
18306	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I think it c- there's be sort of a  benefit  with  very   minimal   input.	no
18307	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Cuz when you  listen  to a sentence,	no
18308	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	you can  tell  -	no
18309	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	"If it's  contrastive  stress you say ""Oh! that word was  stressed """	no
18310	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	and why the heck  not  put it  in  at the  word  level? So -	no
18311	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	so, I mean,	no
18312	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	the part that  I'm  doing, I'm really happy to  supply  that without any -	no
18313	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	cuz it -	no
18314	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Mm-hmm.	no
18315	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	it's just - it's  there.	no
18316	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	O_K. If you think it won't slow you down at all.	no
18317	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	It's not - it doesn't take any thinking.	no
18318	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Yeah.	no
18319	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I'm not going to talk about, you know	no
18320	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	uh, trying  grade  them in any kind of careful way, but just  indicate  -	no
18321	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	if th- if there's a	no
18322	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	prominent word, to indicate it.	no
18323	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Sure.	no
18324	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Yeah,  that's  great.	no
18325	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	All caps.	no
18326	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	No, well, presumably there's a	no
18327	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Whatever.	no
18328	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Whatever.	no
18329	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	an- annotation standard for prefix  characters or something like that. That's what they're using here.	no
18330	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	People -	no
18331	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Yeah, people do different -	no
18332	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	different ways, a- and so just as long as it's systematic in my view,	no
18333	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	O_K.	no
18334	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	you can always	no
18335	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Yeah, exactly.	no
18336	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	filter it into	no
18337	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	some other format.	no
18338	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Exactly.	no
18339	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Exactly.	no
18340	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Anything else?	no
18341	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Well, so, um	no
18342	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	What  is the plan? We're gonna -	no
18343	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I mean,	no
18344	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	How many -	no
18345	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	"I'm gonna go download ""Transcriber"" and Jane and I will look at it"	yes
18346	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	How many -	no
18347	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	"I'm gonna go download ""Transcriber"" and Jane and I will look at it"	no
18348	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	How many -	no
18349	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	How many meetings? What about r-	no
18350	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	our recording schedule?	no
18351	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Oh	no
18352	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	How many meetings are we going to record?	no
18353	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Um.	no
18354	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Which ones are we going to transcribe?	no
18355	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Um.	no
18356	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Do we -	no
18357	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Well I  think  the  answer  is we need to  record	no
18358	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	as  many  as we  can.	no
18359	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	O_K.	no
18360	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Right? I don't see any reason  not  to  try  to record	no
18361	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	a  meeting  or  two  a week.	no
18362	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Absolutely.	no
18363	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Um.	no
18364	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I mean,  more  if we  can.	no
18365	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	And uh	no
18366	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	so I wanna -	no
18367	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	um	no
18368	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I wanna  start  by in the  next  couple weeks just doing	no
18369	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	the Speech group	no
18370	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	until we get to the point where we're  fairly  comfortable with the  hardware  and the  software  and everything  works.	no
18371	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Yeah.	no
18372	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	and then I think I'll - also uh a- Jerry volunteered to have his group do a few.	no
18373	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	So, I'll uh	no
18374	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	try to get those as well.	no
18375	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	O_K.	no
18376	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	How many of these do you  have,	no
18377	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	these  near  mikes?	no
18378	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Five.	no
18379	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	We have  five  of the  wireless.	no

18381	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	O_K.	no
18382	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	And then we	no
18383	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	were -	no
18384	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	going to be  getting  a  bunch  of  wired  ones as  well.	no
18385	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I mean notice that	no
18386	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	n-	no
18387	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Well.	no
18388	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	your -  you  -  you  stood up and  walked   around.   None  of the  rest  of us have.	no
18389	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	And so we could have  wired  mikes and I wouldn't be a big deal.	no
18390	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Oh.	no
18391	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Oh,  I  see.	no
18392	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	for  bigger  meetings.	no

18400	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	yeah.	no
18401	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	It really makes you feel like you're doing  real   work	no
18402	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	when you get all this  hardware.	no
18403	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Well, this is, I mean, compared to the way people	no
18404	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	normally do, like, discourse stuff? you know, it's like you got your -	no
18405	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I mean they've gotten away from w- reel-to-reel tapes, but -	no
18406	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Uh-huh.	no
18407	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	and they  do  have  DAT  recorders,	no
18408	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I mean you do have -	no
18409	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Mm-hmm.	no
18410	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	but I mean this is just	no
18411	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	wonderful, the uh	no
18412	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	added level of	no
18413	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	yeah, compactness in the	no
18414	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	If we can  do  anything with it, yeah.	no
18415	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	channels.	no
18416	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Yep.	no
18417	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I  do  find myself  whispering.	no
18418	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I mean, I suspect -	no

18420	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	My  normal  s-.	no
18421	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I don't  know  why.	no
18422	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I had  noticed  that you were talking quietly, and I was  actually  going to  ask  you.	no
18423	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	It's bizarre.	no
18424	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	yeah, this is not really my normal -	no
18425	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I was going to  ask  you to speak  up.	no
18426	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	pattern.	no
18427	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	But I didn't want you to feel self- conscious.	no
18428	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I think the problem is that I'm afraid that I'm talking into someone's  ear.	no
18429	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Oh.	no
18430	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I  really   do.  So it's - so it's like -	no

18432	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	uh	no
18433	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	control. But uh	no
18434	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Yeah.	no

18447	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	easy  cuz he's got the  lapel  mike, which is so  unobtrusive.	no
18448	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	That's  great.	no
18449	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I  asked  if somebody else  wanted  the lapel mike.	no
18450	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Somebody else can take it next time.	no
18451	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I've been  trying  to  rotate  it  through.  So,  Dan  will get it  next  time.	no
18452	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Are these  more  expensive or  less  expensive than  this  kind?	no
18453	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	They're  much  more expensive.	no
18454	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	O_K.	no
18455	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	I - I -	no
18456	transcript	transcript_Bmr002	Which I  don't   understand	no

18593	transcript	transcript_Bro007	today	no
18594	transcript	transcript_Bro007	we're looking at a	no
18595	transcript	transcript_Bro007	number of uh	yes
18596	transcript	transcript_Bro007	we're looking at a	no
18597	transcript	transcript_Bro007	number of uh	no
18598	transcript	transcript_Bro007	things we're trying	no
18599	transcript	transcript_Bro007	and uh	no
18600	transcript	transcript_Bro007	fortunately for listeners to this uh	no
18601	transcript	transcript_Bro007	we lost some of it's visual	no
18602	transcript	transcript_Bro007	but um	no
18603	transcript	transcript_Bro007	got tables in front of us.	no
18604	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Um	no
18605	transcript	transcript_Bro007	what is - what does combo mean?	no
18606	transcript	transcript_Bro007	So combo is um	no
18607	transcript	transcript_Bro007	a system where we have these features	no
18608	transcript	transcript_Bro007	that go through a network and then	no
18609	transcript	transcript_Bro007	this same string of features but low-pass filtered with the low-pass filter used in	no
18610	transcript	transcript_Bro007	the M_S_G features.	no
18611	transcript	transcript_Bro007	And so these low-pass filtered	no
18612	transcript	transcript_Bro007	goes through M_ eh - another M_L_P	no
18613	transcript	transcript_Bro007	and then the linear output of these two M_L_P's are combined	no
18614	transcript	transcript_Bro007	just by adding the values and then there is this K_L_T.	no
18615	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Um	no
18616	transcript	transcript_Bro007	the output is used as	no
18617	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh features as well.	no
18618	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Um	no
18619	transcript	transcript_Bro007	so	no
18620	transcript	transcript_Bro007	let me try to restate this and see if I have it right.	no
18621	transcript	transcript_Bro007	There is uh -	no
18622	transcript	transcript_Bro007	there is the features	no
18623	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh there's the O_G_I features	no
18624	transcript	transcript_Bro007	and	no
18625	transcript	transcript_Bro007	then um	no
18626	transcript	transcript_Bro007	those	no
18627	transcript	transcript_Bro007	features	no
18628	transcript	transcript_Bro007	um	no
18629	transcript	transcript_Bro007	go through a contextual - uh l- l- let's take this bottom arr-	no
18630	transcript	transcript_Bro007	one pointed to by the bottom arrow.	no
18631	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Um those features	no
18632	transcript	transcript_Bro007	go through a contextualized K_L_T.	no
18633	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
18634	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Then	no
18635	transcript	transcript_Bro007	these features also	no
18636	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh get	no
18637	transcript	transcript_Bro007	um low-pass filtered	no
18638	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah so	no
18639	transcript	transcript_Bro007	yeah I could perhaps draw this on the blackboard	no
18640	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Sure.	no
18641	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah. Yeah.	no
18642	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
18643	transcript	transcript_Bro007	The graph, yeah another one.	no
18644	transcript	transcript_Bro007	@@	no
18645	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah, that's good.	no
18646	transcript	transcript_Bro007	So	no
18647	transcript	transcript_Bro007	So we have these features from O_G_I	no
18648	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
18649	transcript	transcript_Bro007	that goes through the three paths.	no
18650	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Three, O_K.	no
18651	transcript	transcript_Bro007	The first	no
18652	transcript	transcript_Bro007	is a K_L_T using	no
18653	transcript	transcript_Bro007	several	no
18654	transcript	transcript_Bro007	frames	no
18655	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
18656	transcript	transcript_Bro007	of the features.	no
18657	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
18658	transcript	transcript_Bro007	The second path	no
18659	transcript	transcript_Bro007	is uh M_L_P	no
18660	transcript	transcript_Bro007	also using nine frames - several frames of features	no
18661	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
18662	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh-huh.	no
18663	transcript	transcript_Bro007	The third path	no
18664	transcript	transcript_Bro007	is this low-pass filter.	no
18665	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh-huh.	no
18666	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh, M_L_P	no
18667	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Aha! aha!	no
18668	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Adding the outputs just like in the second propose- the - the proposal from - for the first evaluation.	no
18669	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah?	no
18670	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
18671	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
18672	transcript	transcript_Bro007	And then	no
18673	transcript	transcript_Bro007	No, the K_L_T.	no
18674	transcript	transcript_Bro007	the K_L_T	no
18675	transcript	transcript_Bro007	And those two together.	no
18676	transcript	transcript_Bro007	and then the two together again.	no
18677	transcript	transcript_Bro007	That's it.	no
18678	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Two H_T_K.	no
18679	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Um.	no
18680	transcript	transcript_Bro007	O_K so that's - that's this bottom one.	no
18681	transcript	transcript_Bro007	So	no
18682	transcript	transcript_Bro007	this is - yeah	no
18683	transcript	transcript_Bro007	And so uh	no
18684	transcript	transcript_Bro007	and then the - the - the one at the top - and I presume these things that uh are in yellow are in yellow because overall they're the best?	no
18685	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah that's the reason, yeah.	no
18686	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Oh let's focus on them then- so what's the block diagram for the one above it?	no
18687	transcript	transcript_Bro007	For the f- the f- first	no
18688	transcript	transcript_Bro007	yellow line you mean?	no
18689	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
18690	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah	no
18691	transcript	transcript_Bro007	so it's uh basically s- the same except that we don't have this	no
18692	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Step.	no
18693	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh low-pass filtering so we have only two streams.	no
18694	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Well.	no
18695	transcript	transcript_Bro007	There's - there's no	no
18696	transcript	transcript_Bro007	low -	no
18697	transcript	transcript_Bro007	low-pass processing	no
18698	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mm-hmm.	no
18699	transcript	transcript_Bro007	used as additional feature stream.	no
18700	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mm-hmm.	no
18701	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Um	no
18702	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Do you e- um they mentioned - made some - uh when I was on the phone with Sunil they - they mentioned some	no
18703	transcript	transcript_Bro007	weighting	no
18704	transcript	transcript_Bro007	scheme that was used to evaluate all of these numbers.	no
18705	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
18706	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh actually the way things seems to	no
18707	transcript	transcript_Bro007	um well	no
18708	transcript	transcript_Bro007	it's uh	no
18709	transcript	transcript_Bro007	forty percent for T_I-digit, sixty for	no
18710	transcript	transcript_Bro007	all the SpeechDat-Cars, well all these languages.	no
18711	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Ehm	no
18712	transcript	transcript_Bro007	the well match is forty, medium thirty five and high mismatch twenty-five.	no
18713	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
18714	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Um and we don't have the T_I-digits part yet?	no
18715	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh, no.	no
18716	transcript	transcript_Bro007	O_K.	no
18717	transcript	transcript_Bro007	But	no
18718	transcript	transcript_Bro007	yeah.	no
18719	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Generally what you observe with T_I-digits is that the result are very close	no
18720	transcript	transcript_Bro007	whatever the - the system.	no
18721	transcript	transcript_Bro007	O_K.	no
18722	transcript	transcript_Bro007	And so	no
18723	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
18724	transcript	transcript_Bro007	have you	no
18725	transcript	transcript_Bro007	put all these numbers together	no
18726	transcript	transcript_Bro007	into a single number representing that? I mean not -	no
18727	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh not yet. No.	no
18728	transcript	transcript_Bro007	O_K so that should be pretty easy to do and that would be good - then we could compare the two and say what was better.	no
18729	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mmm yeah, yeah.	no
18730	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mmm.	no
18731	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
18732	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Um	no
18733	transcript	transcript_Bro007	and how does this compare	no
18734	transcript	transcript_Bro007	to the numbers -	no
18735	transcript	transcript_Bro007	oh so O_G_I two is just the top -	no
18736	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
18737	transcript	transcript_Bro007	top row?	no
18738	transcript	transcript_Bro007	So yeah to -	no
18739	transcript	transcript_Bro007	actually O_G_I two is the -	no
18740	transcript	transcript_Bro007	the baseline with the O_G_I features	no
18741	transcript	transcript_Bro007	but	no
18742	transcript	transcript_Bro007	this is not exactly the result that they have	no
18743	transcript	transcript_Bro007	because they've - they're still	no
18744	transcript	transcript_Bro007	made some changes in the	no
18745	transcript	transcript_Bro007	features	no
18746	transcript	transcript_Bro007	O_K.	no
18747	transcript	transcript_Bro007	and - well	no
18748	transcript	transcript_Bro007	but	no
18749	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh	no
18750	transcript	transcript_Bro007	actually	no
18751	transcript	transcript_Bro007	our results are better than their results.	no
18752	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Um	no
18753	transcript	transcript_Bro007	I don't know by how much because they did not send us the new results	no
18754	transcript	transcript_Bro007	O_K.  Uh	no
18755	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh	no
18756	transcript	transcript_Bro007	O_K so the one - one place	no
18757	transcript	transcript_Bro007	where it looks like we're messing things up a bit is in the highly mismatched Italian.	no
18758	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah. Yeah.	no
18759	transcript	transcript_Bro007	An-	no
18760	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah there is something funny happening here because - yeah.	no
18761	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
18762	transcript	transcript_Bro007	But there are thirty-six and then	no
18763	transcript	transcript_Bro007	sometimes we are - we are - we are around forty-two and	no
18764	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Now up	no
18765	transcript	transcript_Bro007	but	no
18766	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh so	no
18767	transcript	transcript_Bro007	one of the ideas that you had mentioned last time was having a - a second um silence detection.	no
18768	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah. So there are	no
18769	transcript	transcript_Bro007	some results here	no
18770	transcript	transcript_Bro007	For the Italian. For this one.	no
18771	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh so the	no
18772	transcript	transcript_Bro007	third and the fifth line of the table	no
18773	transcript	transcript_Bro007	So filt is what that is?	no
18774	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Filt, yeah	no
18775	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
18776	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Um	no
18777	transcript	transcript_Bro007	yeah so it seems f- for the - the well match and mismatched condition	no
18778	transcript	transcript_Bro007	it's uh	no
18779	transcript	transcript_Bro007	it brings something.	no
18780	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh but	no
18781	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh actually	no
18782	transcript	transcript_Bro007	apparently there are - there's no	no
18783	transcript	transcript_Bro007	room left for any	no
18784	transcript	transcript_Bro007	silence detector	no
18785	transcript	transcript_Bro007	at the server side because of the delay.	no
18786	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh	no
18787	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Oh we can't do it. Oh O_K.	no
18788	transcript	transcript_Bro007	well	no
18789	transcript	transcript_Bro007	No.	no
18790	transcript	transcript_Bro007	For that - for that we -	no
18791	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Oh.  Too bad.	no
18792	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh	no
18793	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Good idea, but can't do it. O_K.	no
18794	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
18795	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Except I don't know because they -	no
18796	transcript	transcript_Bro007	I think they are still working well.	no
18797	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh-huh.	no
18798	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh t- two days ago they were still working on this	no
18799	transcript	transcript_Bro007	trying to reduce	no
18800	transcript	transcript_Bro007	the delay of the silence detector	no
18801	transcript	transcript_Bro007	so but	no
18802	transcript	transcript_Bro007	yeah if we had time perhaps we could try to find uh	no
18803	transcript	transcript_Bro007	some kind of compromise between the delay that's on the handset and on the server side.	no
18804	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Perhaps try to reduce the delay on the handset and -	no
18805	transcript	transcript_Bro007	but well hmm	no
18806	transcript	transcript_Bro007	For the moment they have this large delay on the -	no
18807	transcript	transcript_Bro007	the feature computation and	no
18808	transcript	transcript_Bro007	O_K.	no
18809	transcript	transcript_Bro007	So	no
18810	transcript	transcript_Bro007	so we don't	no
18811	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Alright so for now at least that's not	no
18812	transcript	transcript_Bro007	there	no
18813	transcript	transcript_Bro007	you have some results with low-pass filter cepstrum	no
18814	transcript	transcript_Bro007	doesn't have a huge effect but it - but it looks like it	no
18815	transcript	transcript_Bro007	you know maybe could help in a couple places.	no
18816	transcript	transcript_Bro007	I th-	no
18817	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
18818	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh little bit.	no
18819	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Um	no
18820	transcript	transcript_Bro007	and um	no
18821	transcript	transcript_Bro007	um	no
18822	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah	no
18823	transcript	transcript_Bro007	and uh	no
18824	transcript	transcript_Bro007	let's see	no
18825	transcript	transcript_Bro007	What else did we	no
18826	transcript	transcript_Bro007	have in there? Uh	no
18827	transcript	transcript_Bro007	I guess it makes a l- um at this point this is	no
18828	transcript	transcript_Bro007	I - I guess I should probably look at these others a little bit uh	no
18829	transcript	transcript_Bro007	And you - you yellowed these out uh but uh	no
18830	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh	no
18831	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Oh I see yeah that - that one you can't use because of the delay.	no
18832	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Those look pretty good.	no
18833	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Um	no
18834	transcript	transcript_Bro007	let's see that one	no
18835	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Well even the - just the - the second row doesn't look that bad right? That's just uh	no
18836	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yep.	no
18837	transcript	transcript_Bro007	yeah? And - and	no
18838	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mmm yeah.	no
18839	transcript	transcript_Bro007	that looks like an interesting one too.	no
18840	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh	no
18841	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Actually the - yeah the second line is	no
18842	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh	no
18843	transcript	transcript_Bro007	pretty much like the first line in yellow	no
18844	transcript	transcript_Bro007	except that we don't have this K_L_T on the first - on the left part of the diagram.	no
18845	transcript	transcript_Bro007	We just have the features	no
18846	transcript	transcript_Bro007	as they are.	no
18847	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mm-hmm.	no
18848	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Um	no
18849	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
18850	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah so when we do this weighted measure we should compare the two cuz it might even come out better.	no
18851	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mm-hmm.	no
18852	transcript	transcript_Bro007	And it's - it's - it's a little - slightly simpler.	no
18853	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
18854	transcript	transcript_Bro007	So -	no
18855	transcript	transcript_Bro007	so there's - so I - I would put that one also as a - as a maybe.	no
18856	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh	no
18857	transcript	transcript_Bro007	and it - yeah and it's	no
18858	transcript	transcript_Bro007	actually  does - does significantly better on the uh	no
18859	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh highly mismatched Italian, so	no
18860	transcript	transcript_Bro007	s- and little worse on the	no
18861	transcript	transcript_Bro007	mis- on the M_M case, but	no
18862	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh	no
18863	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Well yeah it's worse than a few things	no
18864	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mm-hmm.	no
18865	transcript	transcript_Bro007	so uh	no
18866	transcript	transcript_Bro007	let's see how that c- that c- c- see how that comes out on their -	no
18867	transcript	transcript_Bro007	their measure and - are - are we running this uh for T_I-digits or uh	no
18868	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
18869	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
18870	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Now is T_I di - is- is that part of the result that they get for the uh development - th- the results that they're supposed to get at the end of - end of the month, the T_I-digits are there also?	no
18871	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
18872	transcript	transcript_Bro007	It's included, yeah.	no
18873	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Oh O_K.	no
18874	transcript	transcript_Bro007	O_K.	no
18875	transcript	transcript_Bro007	And see what else there is here.	no
18876	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Um	no
18877	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Oh I see - the one - I was looking down here at the - the o- the row below the	no
18878	transcript	transcript_Bro007	lower yellowed one.	no
18879	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh that's	no
18880	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mm-hmm?	no
18881	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh	no
18882	transcript	transcript_Bro007	that's with the reduced uh K_L_T size -	no
18883	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
18884	transcript	transcript_Bro007	reduced dimensionality.	no
18885	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
18886	transcript	transcript_Bro007	What happens there	no
18887	transcript	transcript_Bro007	is it's around the same	no
18888	transcript	transcript_Bro007	and so you could reduce the dimension as you were saying	no
18889	transcript	transcript_Bro007	before a bit perhaps.	no
18890	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah, it's - it's significantly worse well but - Mm-hmm.	no
18891	transcript	transcript_Bro007	It's significantly worse - it's -	no
18892	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Exc- except for the H_M	no
18893	transcript	transcript_Bro007	it's uh	no
18894	transcript	transcript_Bro007	For many a mismatch it's worse.	no
18895	transcript	transcript_Bro007	but	no
18896	transcript	transcript_Bro007	it's - it's mostly worse.	no
18897	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
18898	transcript	transcript_Bro007	But it is little. I mean	no
18899	transcript	transcript_Bro007	not - not by a huge amount, I don't know.	no
18900	transcript	transcript_Bro007	What are - what are the sizes of any of these sets, I - I'm - I'm sure you told me before, but I've forgotten.	no
18901	transcript	transcript_Bro007	So - you know how many words	no
18902	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh	no
18903	transcript	transcript_Bro007	are in	no
18904	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh one of these test sets?	no
18905	transcript	transcript_Bro007	I don't remember.	no
18906	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Um	no
18907	transcript	transcript_Bro007	About?	no
18908	transcript	transcript_Bro007	it's -	no
18909	transcript	transcript_Bro007	it depends - well -	no
18910	transcript	transcript_Bro007	the well matched is generally larger	no
18911	transcript	transcript_Bro007	than the other sets	no
18912	transcript	transcript_Bro007	and I think it's around	no
18913	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Ye-	no
18914	transcript	transcript_Bro007	two thousand or three thousand words perhaps, at least.	no
18915	transcript	transcript_Bro007	But words -	no
18916	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Hmm?	no
18917	transcript	transcript_Bro007	well word - I don't know.	no
18918	transcript	transcript_Bro007	The words, yeah.	no
18919	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Sentences.	no
18920	transcript	transcript_Bro007	S- sentences.	no
18921	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Some sets have five hundred sentences,	no
18922	transcript	transcript_Bro007	so.	no
18923	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
18924	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mmm.	no
18925	transcript	transcript_Bro007	So the - so the sets - so the test sets are between five hundred and two thousand sentences, let's say	no
18926	transcript	transcript_Bro007	and each sentence on the average has four or five digits or is it - most of them longer or	no
18927	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah for the Italian	no
18928	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
18929	transcript	transcript_Bro007	It - it d-	no
18930	transcript	transcript_Bro007	even seven digits y- more or less but sometime	no
18931	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Seven digits.	no
18932	transcript	transcript_Bro007	the sentence have only one digit and sometime	no
18933	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh like uh the number of uh credit cards, something like that.	no
18934	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mm-hmm.	no
18935	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Right, so between one and sixteen. See the - I mean the reason I'm asking is - is - is we have all these small differences and I don't know	no
18936	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mm-hmm?	no
18937	transcript	transcript_Bro007	how seriously to take them, right? So	no
18938	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
18939	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh i- if - if you had uh just	no
18940	transcript	transcript_Bro007	you know - to give an example, if you had uh	no
18941	transcript	transcript_Bro007	um	no
18942	transcript	transcript_Bro007	if you had a thousand words	no
18943	transcript	transcript_Bro007	then uh a - a tenth of a percent would just be one word, right? So - so it wouldn't mean anything.	no
18944	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
18945	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
18946	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Oh  - um	no
18947	transcript	transcript_Bro007	so um	no
18948	transcript	transcript_Bro007	yeah it be kind of - I'd kind of like to know what the	no
18949	transcript	transcript_Bro007	sizes of these test sets were actually.	no
18950	transcript	transcript_Bro007	The size that we have?	no
18951	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah. We could - we could run - run some kind of significance tests or	no
18952	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah since these -	no
18953	transcript	transcript_Bro007	well also just to know the numbers, right. So these - these are word error rates so this is on how many words.	no
18954	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
18955	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
18956	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yep.	no
18957	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah we have the result that the output of the H_T_K	no
18958	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
18959	transcript	transcript_Bro007	The number of -	no
18960	transcript	transcript_Bro007	of sentences, no it's the number isn't.	no
18961	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah sure - sure. Yeah sure. Yeah.	no
18962	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah so anyway if you could just mail out what those numbers are and then - then - that - that be great.	no
18963	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
18964	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Um	no
18965	transcript	transcript_Bro007	what else is there here?	no
18966	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Um see the second -	no
18967	transcript	transcript_Bro007	second from the bottom it says S_I_L, but this is some different kind of silence or thing or -	no
18968	transcript	transcript_Bro007	what was that?	no
18969	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh	no
18970	transcript	transcript_Bro007	It the -	no
18971	transcript	transcript_Bro007	the output silence of the M_L_P.	no
18972	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Oh yeah I see.	no
18973	transcript	transcript_Bro007	It's only one small experiment to know what happened.	no
18974	transcript	transcript_Bro007	To apply	no
18975	transcript	transcript_Bro007	also to in- include also the -	no
18976	transcript	transcript_Bro007	the silence of the M_L_P we have the fifty-six form and the silence to pick up the silence and we include those.	no
18977	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yes.	no
18978	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh-huh, uh-huh.	no
18979	transcript	transcript_Bro007	The silence plus the K_L_T output?	no
18980	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Oh so you're only using the silence.	no
18981	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
18982	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah, because when we apply	no
18983	transcript	transcript_Bro007	the K_L_T	no
18984	transcript	transcript_Bro007	No they're - I think there is this silence in addition to the um K_L_T outputs it is because we - we - we just keep	no
18985	transcript	transcript_Bro007	No.	no
18986	transcript	transcript_Bro007	in addition, yes. In addition t-	no
18987	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh we don't keep all the dimensions after the K_L_T	no
18988	transcript	transcript_Bro007	and - yeah.	no
18989	transcript	transcript_Bro007	and we not s- we are not sure if we pick - we have the silence.	no
18990	transcript	transcript_Bro007	So	no
18991	transcript	transcript_Bro007	we try to add the silence also in addition to the - these twenty-eight	no
18992	transcript	transcript_Bro007	dimensions.	no
18993	transcript	transcript_Bro007	I see.	no
18994	transcript	transcript_Bro007	O_K.	no
18995	transcript	transcript_Bro007	And what - and what's O_G_I forty-five?	no
18996	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh it's o- it's O_G_I two, it's - so the - th- it's the features from the first line	no
18997	transcript	transcript_Bro007	The bottom one there?	no
18998	transcript	transcript_Bro007	It's in fact O_G_I two.	no
18999	transcript	transcript_Bro007	and - yeah.	no
19000	transcript	transcript_Bro007	S-	no
19001	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Right, but I mean what's the - what does the last row mean?	no
19002	transcript	transcript_Bro007	So it's uh basically this but without the K_L_T	no
19003	transcript	transcript_Bro007	on the - from the left path.	no
19004	transcript	transcript_Bro007	I thought that was the one - I thought that was the second row.	no
19005	transcript	transcript_Bro007	So what's the difference between the second	no
19006	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh the second line you don't have this combo stuff so you just	no
19007	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh	no
19008	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Oh.	no
19009	transcript	transcript_Bro007	So this is like the second line but with - with the combo stuff.	no
19010	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
19011	transcript	transcript_Bro007	And with the - all the output of the combo.	no
19012	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
19013	transcript	transcript_Bro007	O_K.	no
19014	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh	no
19015	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
19016	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
19017	transcript	transcript_Bro007	O_K, so -	no
19018	transcript	transcript_Bro007	alright so it looks to me -	no
19019	transcript	transcript_Bro007	I guess the same -	no
19020	transcript	transcript_Bro007	given that we have to take the filt ones out of the - the running because of this delay problem -	no
19021	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mm-hmm.	no
19022	transcript	transcript_Bro007	so it looks to me like the ones you said	no
19023	transcript	transcript_Bro007	I agree are - are the ones to look at but I just would add the -	no
19024	transcript	transcript_Bro007	the - the second row one	no
19025	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
19026	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mmm.	no
19027	transcript	transcript_Bro007	and then um if we can um	no
19028	transcript	transcript_Bro007	oh yeah also	no
19029	transcript	transcript_Bro007	when -	no
19030	transcript	transcript_Bro007	when they're using this weighting scheme of forty, thirty-five, twenty-five	no
19031	transcript	transcript_Bro007	is that on the percentages or on the raw errors? I guess	no
19032	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh	no
19033	transcript	transcript_Bro007	it's probably on the percentages right?	no
19034	transcript	transcript_Bro007	I guess, yeah.	no
19035	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah O_K.	no
19036	transcript	transcript_Bro007	I guess, yeah. Mmm.	no
19037	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Alright.	no
19038	transcript	transcript_Bro007	It's not clear here.	no
19039	transcript	transcript_Bro007	O_K.  Maybe - maybe they'll argue about it.	no
19040	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Um	no
19041	transcript	transcript_Bro007	O_K so if we can know what - how many words are in each and then um Dave uh	no
19042	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Dave promised to get us something tomorrow	no
19043	transcript	transcript_Bro007	which will be there	no
19044	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mm-hmm.	no
19045	transcript	transcript_Bro007	as far as they've gotten  Friday and then we'll operate with that and	no
19046	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
19047	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh how long did it	no
19048	transcript	transcript_Bro007	I guess if we're not doing all these things - if we're only doing	no
19049	transcript	transcript_Bro007	um	no
19050	transcript	transcript_Bro007	um	no
19051	transcript	transcript_Bro007	I guess since this is development data it's legitimate	no
19052	transcript	transcript_Bro007	to do more than one, right?	no
19053	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
19054	transcript	transcript_Bro007	I mean ordinarily if - in final test data you don't want to do	no
19055	transcript	transcript_Bro007	several	no
19056	transcript	transcript_Bro007	and - and take the best that's - that's -	no
19057	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mmm.	no
19058	transcript	transcript_Bro007	that's not proper but if this is development data we could still	no
19059	transcript	transcript_Bro007	look at a couple.	no
19060	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
19061	transcript	transcript_Bro007	We can - yeah. Sure. But	no
19062	transcript	transcript_Bro007	we have to decide - I mean we have to fix the system	no
19063	transcript	transcript_Bro007	on this d- on this data, to choose the best and	no
19064	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
19065	transcript	transcript_Bro007	I-	no
19066	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Right.	no
19067	transcript	transcript_Bro007	these	no
19068	transcript	transcript_Bro007	But the question is when - when do we fix the system, do we fix the system uh tomorrow or do we fix the system on Tuesday?	yes
19069	transcript	transcript_Bro007	these	no
19070	transcript	transcript_Bro007	But the question is when - when do we fix the system, do we fix the system uh tomorrow or do we fix the system on Tuesday?	no
19071	transcript	transcript_Bro007	But we could	no
19072	transcript	transcript_Bro007	it d-	no
19073	transcript	transcript_Bro007	I -	no
19074	transcript	transcript_Bro007	I think we fixed on Tuesday, yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm.	no
19075	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah, O_K except that we do have to write it up.  Also, so	no
19076	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mm-hmm.	no
19077	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
19078	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
19079	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Um	no
19080	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh yeah well.	no
19081	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Well basically it's this with	no
19082	transcript	transcript_Bro007	perhaps some kind of printing and some - some other  @@ .	no
19083	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Right so maybe what we do is we - we - we uh as soon as we get the data from them	no
19084	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah but	no
19085	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mm-hmm.	no
19086	transcript	transcript_Bro007	we start the training and so forth but we start the write-up right away	no
19087	transcript	transcript_Bro007	because as you say there - there's only minor differences between these.	no
19088	transcript	transcript_Bro007	I think you - we could - we could start soon, yeah.	no
19089	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
19090	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Write up something.	no
19091	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah, and -	no
19092	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Um yeah. Mm-hmm.	no
19093	transcript	transcript_Bro007	and I - I would - you know, I would - I'd kind of like to see it maybe I can - I can edit it a bit	no
19094	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh sure.	no
19095	transcript	transcript_Bro007	The - my - what in this si- i- in this situation is my forte which is English.	no
19096	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
19097	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh	no
19098	transcript	transcript_Bro007	so	no
19099	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mmm.	no
19100	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh	no
19101	transcript	transcript_Bro007	H- yeah. Have y- have you seen alt- d- do they have a format for how they want the system descriptions or anything?	no
19102	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh not really.	no
19103	transcript	transcript_Bro007	O_K.	no
19104	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Um	no
19105	transcript	transcript_Bro007	There is the format of the table which is	no
19106	transcript	transcript_Bro007	quite impressive.	no
19107	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah?	no
19108	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh	no
19109	transcript	transcript_Bro007	I see.	no
19110	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yes, for those who are listening to this and not looking at it uh it's not really that impressive, it's just tiny.	no
19111	transcript	transcript_Bro007	It's all these little categories	no
19112	transcript	transcript_Bro007	set a, set b, set c, multi-condition, clean.	no
19113	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh	no
19114	transcript	transcript_Bro007	No mitigation.	no
19115	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Wow.	no
19116	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Do you know what no - what no mitigation means  here ?	no
19117	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Um	no
19118	transcript	transcript_Bro007	it should be the	no
19119	transcript	transcript_Bro007	the problem with the error - channel error or	no
19120	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Oh that's probably the -	no
19121	transcript	transcript_Bro007	this is probably channel error stuff huh? Oh this is i- right, it says right above here  channel   - channel error resilience, yeah.	no
19122	transcript	transcript_Bro007	well, you -	no
19123	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
19124	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
19125	transcript	transcript_Bro007	So recognition performance is just the top part, actually.	no
19126	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh	no
19127	transcript	transcript_Bro007	and they have - yes, split between seen databases and non-seen so basically between development and - and evaluation.	no
19128	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
19129	transcript	transcript_Bro007	And  so -	no
19130	transcript	transcript_Bro007	right, it's presumed there's all sorts of	no
19131	transcript	transcript_Bro007	tuning that's gone on on the	no
19132	transcript	transcript_Bro007	see- what they call seen databases and	no
19133	transcript	transcript_Bro007	there won't be tuning for the uh unseen.	no
19134	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Multi-condition - multi-condition.	no
19135	transcript	transcript_Bro007	So they have - looks like they have	no
19136	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mm-hmm.	no
19137	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh	no
19138	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh	no
19139	transcript	transcript_Bro007	so they splitting up between the T_I-digits and everything else, I see.	no
19140	transcript	transcript_Bro007	So the everything else is the SpeechDat-Car, that's the	no
19141	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah, so it's not divided between languages you mean or -	no
19142	transcript	transcript_Bro007	multi- multilingual	no
19143	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Well, it is. It is, but there's also - there's these tables over here for the - for the T_I-digits and these tables over here for the car	no
19144	transcript	transcript_Bro007	it just	no
19145	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Oh yeah.	no
19146	transcript	transcript_Bro007	data which is - which is I guess all the multilingual stuff	no
19147	transcript	transcript_Bro007	and then uh there's -	no
19148	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
19149	transcript	transcript_Bro007	they also split up between multi-condition and clean only.	no
19150	transcript	transcript_Bro007	For T_I-digits.	no
19151	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yes.	no
19152	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah, actually yeah. For the T_I-digits they want to train	no
19153	transcript	transcript_Bro007	on clean	no
19154	transcript	transcript_Bro007	and on noisy	no
19155	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
19156	transcript	transcript_Bro007	and - yeah.	no
19157	transcript	transcript_Bro007	So we're doing that also, I guess.	no
19158	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh yeah.	no
19159	transcript	transcript_Bro007	But	no
19160	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh we	no
19161	transcript	transcript_Bro007	actually -	no
19162	transcript	transcript_Bro007	do we have the features? Yeah. For the clean T_I-digits but we did not test it yet.	no
19163	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh the clean training stuff.	no
19164	transcript	transcript_Bro007	O_K.	no
19165	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mmm.	no
19166	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Well anyway, sounds like there'll be a lot to do just to  work with our partners to fill out the tables  over the next uh	no
19167	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mm-hmm.	no
19168	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yes.	no
19169	transcript	transcript_Bro007	next few days I guess they have to send it out -	no
19170	transcript	transcript_Bro007	let's see the thirty-first is uh	no
19171	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh Wednesday and I think the - it has to be there by some	no
19172	transcript	transcript_Bro007	hour	no
19173	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh European time on Wednesday so  I think basically	no
19174	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Hmm-hmm.	no
19175	transcript	transcript_Bro007	We lost time uh Wednesday maybe because	no
19176	transcript	transcript_Bro007	E- excuse me?	no
19177	transcript	transcript_Bro007	that the difference in the time may be -	no
19178	transcript	transcript_Bro007	is  a long  different of the time.	no
19179	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Maybe the Thursday	no
19180	transcript	transcript_Bro007	the twelfth of the night of the Thurs- thirty-one	no
19181	transcript	transcript_Bro007	is -	no
19182	transcript	transcript_Bro007	is not valid in Europe.  We don't know is happening.	no
19183	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
19184	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yes, so I mean - I think we have to actually get it done Tuesday  right because I - I think	no
19185	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Tuesday.	no
19186	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah, well.	no
19187	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Except if - if it's the thirty-one at midnight or I don't know -	no
19188	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh	no
19189	transcript	transcript_Bro007	we can  still	no
19190	transcript	transcript_Bro007	do some work on Wednesday morning.	no
19191	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh yeah well.	no
19192	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah, well.	no
19193	transcript	transcript_Bro007	W- i- is but is - is it midni- I thought it was actually something like five P_M	no
19194	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
19195	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
19196	transcript	transcript_Bro007	on -	no
19197	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mm-hmm.	no
19198	transcript	transcript_Bro007	was like - I thought it was five P_M or something, I didn't think it was midnight. I thought they said they wanted everything by	no
19199	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah, five P_M.	no
19200	transcript	transcript_Bro007	well, so five P_M	no
19201	transcript	transcript_Bro007	their time	no
19202	transcript	transcript_Bro007	is - is - if	no
19203	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Not five P_M, three P_M.	no
19204	transcript	transcript_Bro007	three P_M.	no
19205	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Three P_M.	no
19206	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Alright, that's six in the morning here.	no
19207	transcript	transcript_Bro007	It's d-	no
19208	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh no	no
19209	transcript	transcript_Bro007	no.	no
19210	transcript	transcript_Bro007	three - three A_- three P_M?	no
19211	transcript	transcript_Bro007	No, we are wondering about the - the - the hour	no
19212	transcript	transcript_Bro007	that we have to	no
19213	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.	no
19214	transcript	transcript_Bro007	eh I don't know if it's three P_M - it's	no
19215	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Three P_M here is in Europe midnight.	no
19216	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah, it's - it's midnight but	no
19217	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yes, yes, but I didn't think it was midnight that it was due, I thought it was due at some hour during the day like five P_M or something.	no
19218	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Oh O_K.	no
19219	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mm-hmm.	no
19220	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mm-hmm, maybe.	no
19221	transcript	transcript_Bro007	In which case	no
19222	transcript	transcript_Bro007	so I - I - uh well we should look but my assumption is that we basically have to be done Tuesday.  Um	no
19223	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
19224	transcript	transcript_Bro007	so then next Thursday we can sort of have a	no
19225	transcript	transcript_Bro007	little aftermath but then - then we'll actually have the new data which is the German and the Danish	no
19226	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
19227	transcript	transcript_Bro007	but that really will be much less work because	no
19228	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh the system will be fixed	no
19229	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
19230	transcript	transcript_Bro007	so all we'll do is	no
19231	transcript	transcript_Bro007	take whatever  they have and -	no
19232	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
19233	transcript	transcript_Bro007	and uh and run it through the process. Uh we won't be changing the training on anything	no
19234	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mm-hmm.	no
19235	transcript	transcript_Bro007	so there'll be no new training, there'll just be new H_T_K runs, so that's	no
19236	transcript	transcript_Bro007	means in some sense we	no
19237	transcript	transcript_Bro007	can kind of relax from this after -	no
19238	transcript	transcript_Bro007	after Tuesday and -	no
19239	transcript	transcript_Bro007	and uh	no
19240	transcript	transcript_Bro007	maybe next meeting we can start talking a little bit about where we want to go from here uh in terms of	no
19241	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mm-hmm.	no
19242	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh the research.	no
19243	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Um	no
19244	transcript	transcript_Bro007	you know what things	no
19245	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh did you think of when you were	no
19246	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh doing this process that uh you just didn't really have time to adequately	no
19247	transcript	transcript_Bro007	work on uh	no
19248	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mm-hmm.	no
19249	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh	no
19250	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
19251	transcript	transcript_Bro007	so	no
19252	transcript	transcript_Bro007	What?	no
19253	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Oh, Stephane always has these great ideas and -	no
19254	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Sure.	no
19255	transcript	transcript_Bro007	oh, but uh we don't have time.	no
19256	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
19257	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
19258	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
19259	transcript	transcript_Bro007	I'm not sure these are great ideas.	no
19260	transcript	transcript_Bro007	But they're ideas.	no
19261	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah?	no
19262	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
19263	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Oh, that was good. And - and uh also it's still true that uh	no
19264	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
19265	transcript	transcript_Bro007	But	no
19266	transcript	transcript_Bro007	I think it's true that - that we - we at least got fairly consistent	no
19267	transcript	transcript_Bro007	i- improved	no
19268	transcript	transcript_Bro007	results	no
19269	transcript	transcript_Bro007	by running uh the uh neural net transformation in parallel with the features rather than	no
19270	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh in sequence which was - was your suggestion and that - that - that seems to have been borne out.	no
19271	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mm-hmm.	no
19272	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mm-hmm.	no
19273	transcript	transcript_Bro007	The fact that none of these are - are - you know, enormous is - is -	no
19274	transcript	transcript_Bro007	is not	no
19275	transcript	transcript_Bro007	too surprising - most improvements aren't enormous and	no
19276	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
19277	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh some of them are	no
19278	transcript	transcript_Bro007	but uh	no
19279	transcript	transcript_Bro007	I mean you have something really really wrong  and you fix it  you can get big and really enormous improvements but	no
19280	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mm-hmm.	no
19281	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh	no
19282	transcript	transcript_Bro007	um	no
19283	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Cuz our best improvements over the years that we've gotten from	no
19284	transcript	transcript_Bro007	finding bugs, but	no
19285	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Anyway	no
19286	transcript	transcript_Bro007	O_K well I - I think - I see where we are and everybody knows what they're doing and is there - is there anything else we should talk about or - or - are we done?	no
19287	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mm-hmm.	no
19288	transcript	transcript_Bro007	I think it's O_K um.	no
19289	transcript	transcript_Bro007	We	no
19290	transcript	transcript_Bro007	so basically we will - I think we'll try to -	no
19291	transcript	transcript_Bro007	to focus on these three	no
19292	transcript	transcript_Bro007	architectures and -	no
19293	transcript	transcript_Bro007	and perhaps I was thinking also a fourth one with	no
19294	transcript	transcript_Bro007	just - just a single K_L_T because we did not really test that -	no
19295	transcript	transcript_Bro007	removing all these K_L_T's and	no
19296	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh-huh.	no
19297	transcript	transcript_Bro007	putting one single K_L_T at the end.	no
19298	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah, I mean that would be pretty	no
19299	transcript	transcript_Bro007	low maintenance to try it.	no
19300	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Yeah.	no
19301	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Uh if you can fit it in.	no
19302	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mm-hmm.	no
19303	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Oh I have - yeah I do have one other piece of information which uh	yes
19304	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Oh I have - yeah I do have one other piece of information which uh	no
19305	transcript	transcript_Bro007	I should tell people outside of this group too uh	no
19306	transcript	transcript_Bro007	I don't know if we're gonna need it	no
19307	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh but	no
19308	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh Jeff up at the	no
19309	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh University of Washington	no
19310	transcript	transcript_Bro007	has uh gotten a hold of a uh uh some kind of server farm of uh	no
19311	transcript	transcript_Bro007	of ten uh uh multiprocessor uh I_B_M machines R_S six thousands	no
19312	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mm-hmm.	no
19313	transcript	transcript_Bro007	and - and uh so I think each one is four processors or something or - I don't know, eight hundred megahertz or something and	no
19314	transcript	transcript_Bro007	there's four processors in a box and there's ten boxes and there's some kind of ti- so if - you know he's got a lot of processing power	no
19315	transcript	transcript_Bro007	and um we'd have to schedule it but if we have some big jobs and we wanna -	no
19316	transcript	transcript_Bro007	wanna - wanna run them he's -	no
19317	transcript	transcript_Bro007	he's offering it.	no
19318	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mm-hmm.	no
19319	transcript	transcript_Bro007	So.	no
19320	transcript	transcript_Bro007	It's uh	no
19321	transcript	transcript_Bro007	when he was here eh uh he - he used i- not only every machine here but every machine on campus as far as I could tell, so -  so in some ways he just got his payback, but	no
19322	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mm-hmm.	no
19323	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh	no
19324	transcript	transcript_Bro007	again I - I don't know if we'll end up with -	no
19325	transcript	transcript_Bro007	if we're gonna be C_P_U limited on anything that we're doing in this group but - but if - if we are	no
19326	transcript	transcript_Bro007	that's an offer.	no
19327	transcript	transcript_Bro007	O_K well uh	no
19328	transcript	transcript_Bro007	you guys doing great stuff so that's - that - that's really neat and uh	no
19329	transcript	transcript_Bro007	we'll uh	no
19330	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh g- don't think we need to uh	no
19331	transcript	transcript_Bro007	um	no
19332	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Oh well the other thing I guess that I will say	no
19333	transcript	transcript_Bro007	is that uh the digits that we're gonna record momentarily	no
19334	transcript	transcript_Bro007	is starting to get - are starting to get into a pretty good size collection	no
19335	transcript	transcript_Bro007	and um in addition to the SpeechDat stuff we will have those to work with	no
19336	transcript	transcript_Bro007	really pretty soon now so that's - that's another	no
19337	transcript	transcript_Bro007	source of data.	no
19338	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Um	no
19339	transcript	transcript_Bro007	which is	no
19340	transcript	transcript_Bro007	s- under somewhat better control and that we can - we can make measurements of the room the - uh that - you know if we feel there's other measurements we don't have that we'd like to have we can make them and	no
19341	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh Dave and I were just talking about that a little while ago	no
19342	transcript	transcript_Bro007	Mm-hmm.	no
19343	transcript	transcript_Bro007	so	no
19344	transcript	transcript_Bro007	uh that's	no
19345	transcript	transcript_Bro007	another -	no
19346	transcript	transcript_Bro007	another possibility for this - this kind of work.	no
19347	transcript	transcript_Bro007	K, uh if nobody has anything else maybe we should go around do - do our digits -	no
19348	transcript	transcript_Bro007	do our digits duty.	no
19349	transcript	transcript_Bro007	O_K.	yes

19467	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	That's a different thing.	no
19468	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	There's another - I don't know. It starts with a P_ or something. I forget the word for it,	no
19469	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oh.	no
19470	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	but it's - it's um	no
19471	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Typically when you - you're ab- r-	no
19472	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	starting around forty for most people,	no
19473	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	it starts to harden and then it's just harder for the lens to	no
19474	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oh.	no
19475	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	shift things and th- the - the  symptom  is typically that you -	no
19476	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Uh-huh.	no
19477	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	you have to hold stuff uh uh further away to -	no
19478	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
19479	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	to see it.	no
19480	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	In fact, uh m- my brother's a  gerontological psychologist and he - he uh	no
19481	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	came up with an - an uh - a uh body age test which uh	no
19482	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	gets down to sort of only three measurements that are good enough st-  statistical   predictors of all the rest of it.	no
19483	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And one of them is - is the distance	no
19484	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
19485	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	that you  have   to hold it at.	no
19486	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Give someone a piece of paper and then they -	no
19487	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
19488	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	We're - we're live by the way, so we've got a good intro here	no
19489	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oh.	no
19490	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oh. Yeah.  About  how  old  I am. O_K.	no
19491	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yep.  We can edit that out if you want.	no
19492	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oh, that's  optional.	no
19493	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	No, that's O_K.	no
19494	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
19495	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	O_K. So.	yes
19496	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oh, that's  optional.	no
19497	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
19498	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	O_K. So.	no
19499	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	You know .	no
19500	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	This  time the form	no
19501	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	discussion should be very short, right?	no
19502	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	It  also  should be   later.	no
19503	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	O_K.	no
19504	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Because Jane uh is not  here  yet.	no
19505	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Good point.	no
19506	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And uh she'll be most interested in that.	no
19507	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Uh, she's probably  least  involved in the signal-processing stuff so maybe we can just -	no
19508	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	just uh, I don't think we should go though an  elaborate  thing,	no
19509	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	but um uh Jose and I were just talking about	no
19510	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	the uh	no
19511	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	uh, speech e- energy thing,	no
19512	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	The   @@  -	no
19513	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
19514	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	and I uh - We didn't talk about the derivatives. But I think,	no
19515	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	you know, the - the - i-	no
19516	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	if I can -	no
19517	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	if you don't mind my - my speaking for you for a bit,	no
19518	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	um	no
19519	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Uh. Right now,  that  he's not really showing any kind of uh distinction,	no
19520	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	but uh -  but  we discussed a couple of the possible things that uh he can look at.	no
19521	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Um. And uh one is that uh this is all in  log  energy and log energy is basically compressing the distances	no
19522	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	uh  between things.	no
19523	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Um  Another is that he needs to play with the - the different uh  uh temporal	no
19524	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	sizes. He was - he - he was taking everything over two hundred milliseconds	no
19525	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	uh, and uh he's going to vary that number and also look at moving windows, as we discussed before.	no
19526	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Um	no
19527	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And uh - and the other thing is that the - yeah doing the -	no
19528	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	subtracting off the mean and the variance in the -	no
19529	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	uh and dividing it by the  standard deviation in the log domain,	no
19530	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	may not be  the right thing to do.	no
19531	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Hi. Yeah.	no
19532	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Hi Jane!	no
19533	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	We just started.	no
19534	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Could you take that mike there?	no
19535	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Are these the  long  term means? Like, over the whole - I mean,	no
19536	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	the means of   what?	no
19537	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Thanks.	no
19538	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Uh B- Between -	no
19539	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	All the frames in the  conversation?  Or of things that -	no
19540	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	between -	no
19541	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	No.	no
19542	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Between -	no
19543	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	No.	no
19544	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Neither. It's uh between the pauses  uh for some segment.	no
19545	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oh.	no
19546	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And so i- i- his - his - He's making the constraint it has to be at least two hundred milliseconds.	no
19547	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oh.	no
19548	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And so you take that. And then he's -	no
19549	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	he's uh  measuring  at the frame level -	no
19550	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	still at the frame level,	no
19551	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Right.	no
19552	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	of what  -	no
19553	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	and then - and then just uh normalizing with that larger amount.	no
19554	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	um and -	no
19555	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But one thing he was pointing out is when he - he looked at a bunch of examples in log domain, it  is  actually pretty hard to see	no
19556	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	the  change.	no
19557	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And you can sort of  see that, because of j- of just	no
19558	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	putting it on the board that	no
19559	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yep.	no
19560	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	if you sort of have  log-X_  plus	no
19561	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	log- X_ ,	no
19562	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah, maybe it's not log  distributed .	no
19563	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	that's the  log  of  X_  plus the  log  of  two  and it's just,  you know, it - it diminishes the  effect of having two of them.	no
19564	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mmm. Yeah.	no
19565	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	@@	no
19566	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But you could do like a C_D_ F  there instead? I mean, we don't  know  that the distribution here is	no
19567	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Um.	no
19568	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yes, right.	no
19569	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	normally.	no
19570	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So -	no
19571	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So just some kind of a simple -	no
19572	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So what I was suggesting to him is that -	no
19573	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Actually, a  P_D_F .	no
19574	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But, you know, uh	no
19575	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	P_D_F	no
19576	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But,  either   way.  Yeah.	no
19577	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
19578	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
19579	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah, eith- eith- uh	no
19580	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Something like that where it's sort of data driven.	no
19581	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	B- Yeah, but I think  also	no
19582	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	u-	no
19583	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I think a good first indicator is when the - the - the researcher looks at	no
19584	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	examples of the data	no
19585	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	and can  not  see	no
19586	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	a change  in how big the - the signal is,	no
19587	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
19588	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	when the two speaker -	no
19589	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Then, that's a problem	no
19590	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	right there.	no
19591	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
19592	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oh yeah.	no
19593	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So.	no
19594	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I think you should at  least  be able,	no
19595	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	"doing casual looking and can get the sense, "" Hey,  there's something  there. "" and then you can play around with the measures."	no
19596	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oh yeah.	no
19597	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
19598	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And when he's looking in the log domain he's not really seeing it.	no
19599	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So. And when he's looking in straight  energy  he  is,	no
19600	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	so that's a good place to start.	no
19601	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
19602	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Um.	no
19603	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So that was - that was the discussion we just had.	no
19604	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Um.	no
19605	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	The other thing	no
19606	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Actually we ca- had a  question  for  Adam  in this.	no
19607	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	How -	no
19608	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Uh, when you did the	no
19609	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	sampling?	no
19610	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	uh  over the  speech segments or s- or sampling over the -	no
19611	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	the individual channels in order to do the e-	no
19612	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	uh the  amplitude equalization,	no
19613	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	did you do it over	no
19614	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	just the entire - everything in the mike channels? You didn't try to find speech?	no
19615	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	No, I just took over the entire s- uh entire channel	no
19616	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	um  sampled ten minutes randomly.	no
19617	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Right, O_K. So then  that  means that someone who didn't speak	no
19618	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	very much	no
19619	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	would be largely represented by silence.	no
19620	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yep.	no
19621	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And someone who would - who would be -	no
19622	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So the normalization factor	no
19623	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	probably  is  i- i- i-	no
19624	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah, this was quite quick and dirty, and it was just for   listening.	no
19625	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	is - is -	no
19626	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
19627	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
19628	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	O_K.	no
19629	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And for  listening  it seems to work really  well.	no
19630	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
19631	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
19632	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
19633	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So.	no
19634	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
19635	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But that's -	no
19636	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Right. So th-	no
19637	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But, it's not -	no
19638	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
19639	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Not a good measure.	no
19640	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	O_K.	no
19641	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So yeah there - there - there -	no
19642	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	There's a good chance then given that	no
19643	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	different people  do  talk different amounts  that there is -	no
19644	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
19645	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
19646	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	there - there is still a lot more to be gained from gain norm- normalization with some	no
19647	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mmm.	no
19648	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yes, absolutely.	no
19649	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	sort if -	no
19650	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	if we can figure out a way to do it.	no
19651	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
19652	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Uh. But	no
19653	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	we were agreed that in addition to that	no
19654	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	uh there should be	no
19655	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	s- stuff related  to  pitch and harmonics and so forth.	no
19656	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
19657	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So we didn't talk at all about uh the other derivatives, but uh again just - just looking at -	no
19658	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Uh, I think uh Liz has a very good point,	no
19659	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	that in fact it would be much more graphic just to show -	no
19660	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
19661	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Well, actually, you  do  have some distributions here,	no
19662	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
19663	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	uh for  these  cases.	no
19664	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	You have some histograms,	no
19665	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
19666	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	um  and  uh,	no
19667	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	they don't look very separate.	no
19668	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	uh   separated.	no
19669	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	This is the - the first derivate of  log of frame  energy	no
19670	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	What  -	no
19671	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
19672	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
19673	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	uh without any kind of normalization.	no
19674	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
19675	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Log energy.	no
19676	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	These the-	no
19677	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Sorry.	no
19678	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	These are the - the first experiments uh with comment uh	no
19679	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Frame energy.	no
19680	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Except that	no
19681	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	it's hard to judge this because the - they're not normalized.	no
19682	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	It's just number of frames.	no
19683	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
19684	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
19685	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
19686	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
19687	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But yeah, even so.	no
19688	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	W-	no
19689	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I mean, what I meant is, even if you use  linear,   you know,  raw	no
19690	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	"""Number"" -"	no
19691	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	measures, like  raw energy or whatever,	no
19692	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	maybe	no
19693	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	we shouldn't make any assumptions about the distribution's  shape,	no
19694	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	and just use -	no
19695	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	you know, use the distribution to model the -	no
19696	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	the mean, or what- y-	no
19697	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	you know, rather than the mean take some -	no
19698	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah. But - And so in - in  these  he's  got	no
19699	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
19700	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	that.	no
19701	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	He's got some pictures.	no
19702	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
19703	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But he doesn't - he doesn't in the -	no
19704	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	he- i-	no
19705	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	just  in  derivatives,	no

19707	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	but not in the -	no
19708	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oh.	no
19709	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	but he d-	no
19710	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Right. So, we don't  know what they look like  on the,  tsk -	no
19711	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	but he doesn't -	no
19712	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	doesn't -	no
19713	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But he didn't h- have it for the energy.	no
19714	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	For the raw.	no
19715	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	He had it for the derivatives.	no
19716	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
19717	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So.	no
19718	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
19719	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I mean, there might be something there. I don't know.	no
19720	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Huh.	no
19721	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
19722	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Interesting	no
19723	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Here I - I	no
19724	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oh that - yeah that's a good q-	no
19725	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	in -	no
19726	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	did - did you have this sort of thing, for just the -	no
19727	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	just the l-	no
19728	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	r- uh the -	no

19733	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I - I - I haven't  the result	no
19734	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	O_K. Yeah. So she - she's right. That's a -	no
19735	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	but it's the - it's the - the - the following.	no
19736	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Well it might be just good to know what it looks like.	no
19737	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Cuz -	no
19738	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah. That's -	no
19739	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Huh?	no
19740	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	That's uh  cuz I'd mentioned scatter plots before but she's right, I mean, even before you get the scatter plots, just looking at a  single  feature	no
19741	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
19742	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	uh,	no
19743	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	looking at the distribution,  is  a good thing to do.	no
19744	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Catal-  uh - Combining the different possibilities of uh the parameters.	no
19745	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I - I - I - I mean the - the - the scatter plot	no
19746	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	combining eh different  n- two combination.	no
19747	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	combination of two,  of energy and derivate -	no
19748	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah, but - but what she's saying	no
19749	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	is, which is right, is  le-	no
19750	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I mean, let's start with the - Before we get complicated,	no
19751	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	let's start with the  most   basic  wh- thing,	no
19752	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	which is   we're  arguing	no
19753	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	that if you take energy -	no
19754	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	uh if you  look  at the  energy,	no
19755	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	that, when two people are speaking at the same time, usually	no
19756	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	there'll be  more  energy than when one is right?	no
19757	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
19758	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	That's - that sort of hypothesis. And the first way you'd look at that,	no
19759	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	That's right.	no
19760	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	uh s-	no
19761	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	she's, you know, absolutely right, is that you would	no
19762	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	just take a look at the  distribution  of those two  things,	no
19763	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
19764	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	much  as you've  plotted  them  here,	no
19765	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	You know, but just - but just -	no
19766	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
19767	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	just uh do it -	no
19768	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Well in this case you have  three.	no
19769	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	You have the  silence,  and that - that's fine.	no
19770	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
19771	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So,	no
19772	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	uh with three colors or three shades or whatever,	no
19773	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	just - just look at those distributions.	no
19774	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
19775	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And then, given that as a base, you can see if that gets improved,	no
19776	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	you know, or - or -	no
19777	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	or  worsened   by the -	no
19778	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	looking at  regular  energy,	no
19779	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	looking at  log  energy, we were just proposing that maybe it's -	no
19780	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	you know, it's harder to  see with the log energy,	no
19781	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
19782	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	um	no
19783	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	and uh	no
19784	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	also these different normalizations,	no
19785	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	does   a particular choice of normalization make it better?	no
19786	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But I had maybe made it too  complicated	no
19787	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	by suggesting	no
19788	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	early on, that you look at  scatter  plots because that's looking at a distribution in  two  dimensions.	no
19789	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
19790	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Let's start off just in  one,	no
19791	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
19792	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	uh, with this  feature.	no
19793	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
19794	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I think that's probably the most basic thing, before anything very  complicated.	no
19795	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
19796	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
19797	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Um	no
19798	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And then we- w- I think we're agreed that	no
19799	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I agree, yeah.	no
19800	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	pitch-related  things are - are - are going to be a - a really likely candidate	no
19801	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Uh-huh.	no
19802	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	to  help.	no
19803	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Um	no
19804	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	O_K.	no
19805	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But	no
19806	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	since -	no
19807	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	uh  your  intuition	no
19808	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	from looking at some of the  data,	no
19809	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	is that when you looked at the regular energy,	no
19810	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	that it  did  in fact usually go  up,	no
19811	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	when two people were  talking,	no
19812	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
19813	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
19814	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah, yeah, yeah.	no
19815	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	that's - eh	no
19816	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	you know, you should be able to come up with a measure which will	no
19817	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	match your intuition.	no
19818	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And she's right,	no
19819	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	that a -	no
19820	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	that having a -	no
19821	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But -	no
19822	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	having -	no
19823	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	having this  table,  with a whole bunch of things,  with the standard deviation, the variance and so forth,	no
19824	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Uh-huh.	no
19825	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	it's - it's -	no
19826	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	it's  harder  to interpret than just looking at the -	no
19827	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
19828	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But -	no
19829	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	the same kind of picture you have here.	no
19830	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	It - it's curious but uh I f- I found it in the - in the mixed file,	no
19831	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	in one channel	no
19832	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	that eh in several - oh e- eh several times eh you have an speaker	no
19833	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	talking alone	no
19834	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
19835	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	with a high level of energy	no
19836	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
19837	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	eh	no
19838	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	in the middle eh a zone of overlapping	no
19839	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
19840	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	with	no
19841	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	mmm less energy	no
19842	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	and	no
19843	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	eh  come  with another speaker with high energy and the	no

19854	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	This is -	no
19855	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I w- want to  point   to visual things,	no

19861	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	"""If it's a  reasonable  feature at  all,"	no
19862	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	"there's  some  separation."""	no

19866	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So.  Locally.  And the other thing is I-	no

19868	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
19869	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And -	no
19870	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Sorry.  I -	no
19871	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I was just going to say that - that	no
19872	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	right now we're just  exploring.	no
19873	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	What you would imagine  eventually,  is that you'll feed all of these features into some	no
19874	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
19875	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	discriminative system.	no
19876	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
19877	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
19878	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And so even if - if one of the features	no
19879	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	does a good job at  one  type of overlap, another feature might do a good job at  another  type of overlap.	no
19880	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
19881	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
19882	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah, this is the -	no
19883	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Right. I mean the -	no
19884	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	the reason I had suggested the scatter f- p- features is I used to do this a lot,	no
19885	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	when we had	no
19886	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	thirteen or fifteen or twenty features  to look at.	no
19887	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	um	no
19888	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Because something is a  good  feature	no
19889	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	uh by itself,	no
19890	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	you don't really know how it'll behave in combination and so it's nice to have as many -	no
19891	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	as many together at the same time as possible	no
19892	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	in uh in some reasonable visual form. There's cool graphic things people have had sometimes to put together three or four in some funny -	no
19893	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	funny way.	no
19894	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But it's true	no
19895	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	that you  shouldn't  do  any  of that unless you know	no
19896	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	that	no
19897	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	the  individual  ones, at least, have -	no
19898	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
19899	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	have some uh -	no
19900	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Well,  especially  for  normalizing.  I mean,	no
19901	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	some hope	no
19902	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
19903	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	it's  really  important to  pick a normalization that matches the distribution for that feature.	no
19904	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
19905	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And it may not be the same	no
19906	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	for all the types of overlaps or	no
19907	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	the windows may not be	no
19908	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	the same.	no
19909	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	e-  Actually, I was wondering,	no
19910	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	right now	no
19911	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	you're taking a -	no
19912	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	all  of the  speech,	no
19913	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	from the whole meeting,	no
19914	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	and you're trying to find points of overlap,	no
19915	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	but we don't really know which speaker is overlapping with which speaker, right?	no
19916	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Right.	no
19917	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
19918	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So I mean another way would just be to take	no
19919	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	the speech from  just,  say, Morgan,	no
19920	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And  just  Jane and then  just  their overlaps,	no
19921	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	like -	no
19922	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	but by hand, by cheating,	no
19923	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	and looking at	no
19924	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	you know, if you can detect something  that  way, because if we  can't  do it  that  way, there's no	no
19925	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	No prayer.	no
19926	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	good way that we're going to be able to do it.	no
19927	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	That - You know, there might be something	no
19928	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	helpful  and  cleaner  about looking at just  individuals and then that combination alone.	no
19929	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
19930	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Plus,  I think it	no
19931	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
19932	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	has more elegant -	no
19933	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	e-	no
19934	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	The m- the right model will be  easier to see that way.	no
19935	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So if - I don't know, if you go through and you find	no
19936	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
19937	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Adam,  cuz he has a lot of overlaps and some other speaker who also has e- enough speech and just	no
19938	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	sort of look at those	no
19939	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
19940	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	three  cases of Adam and the other person and the overlaps, maybe -	no
19941	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	and just look at the  distributions,  maybe there  is  a clear	no
19942	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
19943	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Uh-huh.	no
19944	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	pattern but we just can't	no
19945	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	see it because there's too many	no
19946	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	combinations of - of people	no
19947	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
19948	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	that can overlap.	no
19949	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I had the same intuition last - last - last week.	no
19950	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So.	no
19951	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
19952	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Just seems sort of complex.	no
19953	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I think it's - to start with it's s-	no
19954	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	your - your idea of simplifying,	no
19955	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	starting with something that	no
19956	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	you can see	no
19957	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	eh you know without	no
19958	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	the	no
19959	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	extra	no
19960	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	layers of -	no
19961	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Right.	no
19962	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Cuz if energy doesn't matter  there,  like -	no
19963	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I don't think this is true, but what if	no
19964	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	To study  individual?	no
19965	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Sorry, what?	no
19966	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Hmm?	no
19967	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	To study individual?	no
19968	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Well, you - you - you don't have to study  everybody  individually but	no
19969	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	The - the - the -	no
19970	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Well, to study the simplest case	no
19971	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But -	no
19972	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	just simple case and	no
19973	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	to get rid of extra -	no
19974	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Consider -	no
19975	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	the one that has the lot of data associated with it.	no
19976	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Right.	no
19977	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Cuz what if it's the case and I don't think this is true -	no
19978	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	That was a  great  overlap by the way.	no
19979	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	What if it's the case that when two people overlap they equate their -	no
19980	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	you know, there's a  conservation of energy and everybody -	no
19981	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	both   people talk more softly? I don't think this happens at  all.	no
19982	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Or - or what if what if the equipment -	no
19983	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Or they get louder.	no
19984	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	what if the  equipment  adjusts somehow,	no
19985	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	there's some	no
19986	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	equalizing in there?	no
19987	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah	no
19988	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	or -	no
19989	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Uh,	no
19990	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I mean.	no
19991	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	no we  don't  have  that.	no
19992	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But.	no
19993	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Well, but -	no
19994	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	O_K.	no
19995	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But I think that's what I was  saying  about	no
19996	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	different types of	no
19997	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Saturation.	no
19998	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	overlap.	no
19999	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	There are - there are different	no
20000	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	types,	no
20001	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	and  within  those types,	no
20002	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	like as  Jose  was saying, that  sounded like a backchannel overlap,	no
20003	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	"meaning the kind that's  a friendly  encouragement,  like ""Mm-hmm."", ""Great!"", ""Yeah!"""	no
20004	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20005	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And it  doesn't  take - you don't take the  floor.	no
20006	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Um, but,	no
20007	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	some of  those,  as you showed, I think can be discriminated by the duration of the overlap.	no
20008	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20009	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So.	no
20010	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	It -	no
20011	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Actually the s- new student, Don, who um Adam has met, and he was	no
20012	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	at one of our meetings - He's	no
20013	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	getting his feet wet and then he'll be starting again	no
20014	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	in mid-January. He's interested in trying to distinguish the types of overlap.	no
20015	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I don't know if he's talked with you yet.	no
20016	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20017	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But in sort of honing in on these different types and -	no
20018	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I don't consi-	no
20019	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Now I don't consider that possibility.	no
20020	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	This is a s- a general studio of the overlapping	no
20021	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So maybe -	no
20022	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20023	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	we're studying the -	no
20024	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So it might be something that we can	no
20025	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Well  I -	no
20026	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	help by categorizing some of them and then,	no
20027	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	i-	no
20028	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I -	no
20029	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I - I would s-	no
20030	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	you know, look at that.	no
20031	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	actually  still  recommend that he do the overall thing	no
20032	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	because  it would be the  quickest  thing for him to do.	no
20033	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	He could - You see, he already has all his stuff in place, he has the histogram mechanism,	no
20034	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20035	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	he has the stuff that subtracts out -	no
20036	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	and all he has to do	no
20037	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	is change it uh	no
20038	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	uh from - from log to plain energy	no
20039	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	and plot the histogram	no
20040	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	and  look  at it.	no
20041	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And  then  he should go on and do the other  stuff	no
20042	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20043	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	bec-	no
20044	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	but -	no
20045	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah, no. I  didn't  mean that -	no
20046	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But this will -	no
20047	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	that -	no
20048	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	for  you  to do that, but I was thinking if -	no
20049	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	if Don and I are trying to get   categories  and we label some  data  for you, and we say this is what we think is going -	no
20050	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
20051	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
20052	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So you don't have to worry about it. And here's the three types of overlaps. And we'll - we'll do the  labeling  for you.	no
20053	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20054	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20055	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Hm- hmm.	no
20056	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Um.	no
20057	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Consider different class of overlap?	no
20058	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah, that we would be working on  anyway.	no
20059	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	If there's time.	no
20060	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20061	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Then maybe  you can  try  some different things for those three  cases,  and see if that helps, or -	no
20062	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20063	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	This is the thing I - I comment with you before,	no
20064	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	that uh we have a great variation of th- situation of overlapping.	no
20065	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
20066	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And the behavior for energy is,	no
20067	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	uh log energy,	no
20068	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	is not uh the same all the time.	no
20069	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
20070	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And -	no
20071	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But I guess I was just saying that - that right now	no
20072	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	uh	no
20073	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	from the  means  that you gave,	no
20074	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I don't have  any  sense	no
20075	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	of whether	no
20076	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	even,	no
20077	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	you know, there are  any  significant number of cases for which there is distinct - and I would imagine there  should  be	no
20078	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20079	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	some -	no
20080	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	you know, there should be -	no
20081	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	The distributions	no
20082	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	should be  somewhat   separated.	no
20083	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20084	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Uh and	no
20085	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I - I would still guess that if they are not separated at  all,	no
20086	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20087	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	that there's some -	no
20088	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	there's - there's most likely something wrong in the way that we're measuring it.	no
20089	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20090	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20091	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Um,	no
20092	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	but	no
20093	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	um	no
20094	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	For instance, I mean I wouldn't expect that it was very  common	no
20095	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	overall,  that	no
20096	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	when two people were talking at the same time,	no
20097	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	that it would - that it really was	no
20098	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	lower,  although sometimes, as you say, it  would.	no
20099	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20100	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20101	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah, no, that was - That was a jok-	no
20102	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So.	no
20103	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So.	no
20104	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	or a sort of,	no
20105	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20106	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	a case where - where you would  never  know that unless you actually	no
20107	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I mean. No. It could - it probably  does  happen sometimes.	no
20108	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20109	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	go and look at	no
20110	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Right.	no
20111	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20112	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20113	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	two individuals. So.	no
20114	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20115	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mind if I turned that light off? The flickering is annoying me.	no
20116	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	O_K.	no
20117	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	It  might  the  case,  though, that the significant energy, just as Jose was saying,  comes  in the  non-backchannel  cases.	no
20118	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Because in back-  Most  people when they're talking don't change their own	no
20119	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	energy when they get a backchannel, cuz they're not really  predicting  the backchannel.	no
20120	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
20121	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	"And sometimes it's a nod and sometimes it's an ""mm-hmm"". And the  ""mm-hmm "" is really usually very low  energy."	no
20122	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20123	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20124	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So maybe those don't actually have much difference in energy. But	no
20125	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	all the  other  cases might.	no
20126	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	e-	no
20127	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	and the backchannels are sort of easy to spot	no
20128	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	s- in terms of their words or - I mean, just listen to it. So.	no
20129	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20130	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	e-	no
20131	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But -	no
20132	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	and - and again what they - what difference there  was  would kind of be lost in taking the log,	no
20133	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	so,	no
20134	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Well, it would be lost  no matter what you  do.  It just -	no
20135	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	as well.	no
20136	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20137	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mmm,	no
20138	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	no, if it's -	no
20139	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	if i-	no
20140	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	if it's -	no
20141	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Tone	no
20142	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Well, it  won't  be as  big.	no
20143	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I mean, even if you take the  log,  you can - your model just has a more sensitive  measures. So.	no
20144	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20145	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Sure, but  tone  might be very	no
20146	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	"Yeah, you're ""mm-hmm"" tone is going to be very different."	no
20147	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20148	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Right.	no
20149	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Right.	no
20150	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	You could imagine doing  specialized  ones for different  types  of backchannels,	no
20151	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	if you could - if you had a good model for it.	no
20152	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	"Your ""mm-hmm"" detector."	no
20153	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	If - if you're - a-	no
20154	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I guess my point is, if you're doing essentially a linear separation, taking the log first  does  in fact make it harder to separate.	no
20155	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Right.	no
20156	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20157	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So it's -	no
20158	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So, uh if you i- i-	no
20159	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So i- if there - if there close to things it does	no
20160	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20161	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	it's a  nonlinear  operation that  does  in fact change the distinction. If you're doing a non- if you're doing some fancy thing then - then yeah.	no
20162	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And right now we're essentially doing this linear thing by looking across here and - and saying we're going to cut it here.	no
20163	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Um	no
20164	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	and that - that's the indicator that we're getting.	no
20165	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But  anyway,  yeah, we're not  disagreeing on any of this, we should look at it more uh - more finely,	no
20166	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	but uh uh I think that -	no
20167	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	This often happens, you do fairly complicated things,	no
20168	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	and then you stand back from them and you realize that you haven't done something simple.	no
20169	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So	no
20170	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	uh, if you generated something like that just for the energy and see,	no
20171	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	and then, a- a- a- as - as Liz says, when they g- have uh uh smaller um, more coherent groups to look at, that would be another interesting thing later.	no
20172	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Uh-huh.	no
20173	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Uh-huh.	no
20174	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And then that should give us some indication -	no
20175	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	between  those, should give us some indication of whether there's anything to be achieved f- from energy at  all.	no
20176	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And then you can move on to the uh	no
20177	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	uh more  pitch related stuff.	no
20178	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
20179	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I - I - I think this is a good idea.	no
20180	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	O_K.	no
20181	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Not  consider the log	no
20182	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
20183	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	energy.	no
20184	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20185	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	@@	no
20186	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But then the -	no
20187	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Have you started looking at the pitch related  stuff at all, or - ?	no
20188	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	The - ?	no
20189	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Pitch  related?	no
20190	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Harmonicity and so on?	no
20191	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I - I'm preparing the - the program but I don't - I don't begin	no
20192	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Preparing to -	no
20193	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	because eh	no
20194	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20195	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I saw your email and	no
20196	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I agree with you	no
20197	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20198	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	it's better to -	no
20199	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I suppose it's better to - to consider the - the energy this kind of parameter	no
20200	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oh, that's  not  what I  meant.	no
20201	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	bef-	no
20202	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	No, no. I - I - I -	no
20203	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I - Well,	no
20204	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	we  certainly  should  see  this but I - I - I -	no
20205	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I think that the harm-	no
20206	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I  certainly  wasn't saying this was  better  than the	no
20207	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	harmonicity and pitch related things I was just saying	no
20208	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I - I go on with the - with the	no
20209	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20210	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	pitch, aha!	no
20211	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	O_K.	no
20212	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah, I was just saying -	no
20213	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I - I - I - I understood uh that eh	no
20214	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I - I had to finish	no
20215	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	by the moment with the	no
20216	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	and - and concentrate my - my energy in that problem.	no
20217	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	O_K. O_K.	no
20218	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	O_K. But I think, like, all these derivatives and second derivatives and all these other very fancy things, I think I would just sort of  look  at the energy  and then	no
20219	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	get into the  harmonicity  as - as	no
20220	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	O_K. I go on	no
20221	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	a suggestion.	no
20222	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	with the pitch.	no
20223	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Uh	no
20224	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	O_K. So maybe uh	no
20225	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	since w- we're trying to	no
20226	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	uh compress the meeting,	no
20227	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	um, I know  Adam  had some  form  stuff he wanted to talk about	no
20228	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	and did you have some?	no
20229	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I wanted to ask just s- something on the end of  this  top- topic. So,	yes
20230	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I wanted to ask just s- something on the end of  this  top- topic. So,	no
20231	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	when I presented my results about the uh distribution of overlaps and the speakers and the profiles of the speakers,	no
20232	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Uh-huh.	no
20233	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	at the bottom of that I  did  have a  proposal,  and I had plan to go  through  with it, of - of co-  coding  the types of overlaps that people were  involved  in s-	no
20234	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	just with reference to speaker style so,	no
20235	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oh.	no
20236	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	you know, with reference - and you know I said that on my - in my  summary,  that	no
20237	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	That'd be great.	no
20238	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah, I remem- Right.	no
20239	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	you know so it's like people may have different amounts of being  overlapped  with or overlapping	no
20240	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	but that in itself is not  informative  without knowing what  types  of overlaps they're involved in so	no
20241	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I  was planning to do a taxonomy of  types  overlaps with reference to  that.	no
20242	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	That  would be  great.  That would be really  great.	no
20243	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20244	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So,	no
20245	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	but it you know it's like	no
20246	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Hmm.	no
20247	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	it sounds like you also have uh something in that  direction.	no
20248	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Is - is it -	no
20249	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	We have nothing - You know, basically, we got  his  environment  set up. He's - he's a double-E_	no
20250	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	you know. So.	no
20251	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	It's mostly that,	no
20252	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	if we  had  to  label it ourselves, we - we  would  or we'd have to, to get started,	no
20253	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	but if -  It -	no
20254	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	it would be much better if  you  can do it.	no
20255	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	You'd  be much better  at doing it also because	no
20256	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	you know, I - I'm not -	no
20257	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Interesting.	no
20258	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I don't  have  a good feel for how they should be sorted out, and I really didn't wanna	no
20259	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	go into that if I didn't have to. So if -	no
20260	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	If you're w- willing to do that or - or -	no
20261	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Well maybe we can O_K.	no
20262	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	It would be interesting, though, to talk, maybe not at the meeting,	no
20263	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20264	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	but at some other time about what are the classes.	no
20265	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
20266	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20267	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20268	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
20269	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I think  that's  a research  effort in and of itself,	no
20270	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah, it would be interesting.	no
20271	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	because you can  read  the literature, but I don't know how it'll  turn out and,	no
20272	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20273	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	It seems like we also s- with reference to a purpose, too, that we we'd want to have them coded.	no
20274	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I would think it's interesting, yeah.	no
20275	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	You know, it's  always  an interesting question.	no
20276	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20277	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	That'd be  great.	no
20278	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20279	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yep.	no
20280	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	That'd be  really  great. And we'd still have some  funding	no
20281	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	O_K.	no
20282	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I can do that.	no
20283	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	uh- uh-	no
20284	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	for this project, like probably,	no
20285	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	if we had to hire some - like an undergrad, because uh Don is being	no
20286	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	hhh.	no
20287	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	covered half time on something else -	no
20288	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
20289	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I mean,	no
20290	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	he - we're not paying him  the full	no
20291	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	R_A-ship for -  all  the  time.  So.	no
20292	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	um	no
20293	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	If we got it to where we wanted - we needed someone to do that - I don't think there's really enough	no
20294	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	data  where - where -	no
20295	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
20296	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah, I see this as a prototype,	no
20297	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20298	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	to use the only the -	no
20299	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20300	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	the already transcribed meeting as just a prototype.	no
20301	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I - I think a- a- another	no
20302	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	parameter we c- we -	no
20303	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But -	no
20304	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	we can consider is eh the  duration.	no
20305	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
20306	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Another e- e- m-	no
20307	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	besides eh the - the class of overlap,	no
20308	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	the duration.	no
20309	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Because is possible  eh some s- s- um eh	no
20310	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	some classes eh has eh	no
20311	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	a type of a duration, eh,	no
20312	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	a duration very short	no
20313	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
20314	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	uh when we have -	no
20315	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah, definitely.	no
20316	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah, maybe -	no
20317	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	It may be  correlated.	no
20318	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	we have overlapping with speech.	no
20319	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Is possible	no
20320	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
20321	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	to have.	no
20322	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And it's interesting,	no
20323	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I think,	no
20324	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	to consider the - the  window   of normalization,	no
20325	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	normalization window.	no
20326	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Eh  because eh if we have a type of,	no
20327	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	a kind of eh	no
20328	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	overlap, eh	no
20329	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	backchannel overlap,	no
20330	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	with a short duration,	no
20331	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	is possible	no
20332	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	eh to normali- i- i-	no
20333	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	that if we normalize eh with eh	no
20334	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	eh consider only the - the eh window	no
20335	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	eh by the left eh ri- eh	no
20336	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	side on the right side	no
20337	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	overlapping with a - a very	no
20338	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	eh oh a small window	no
20339	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	eh the - if the fit of normalization is eh	no
20340	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	mmm	no
20341	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	bigger	no
20342	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	eh in that overlapping zone eh very short	no
20343	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
20344	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah, that's true. The window shouldn't be  larger  than the  backchannel.	no
20345	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I - I me-	no
20346	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I - I understand.	no
20347	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I mean that you have	no
20348	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20349	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	eh you have a backchannel, eh, eh - you have a overlapping zone	no
20350	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	very short	no
20351	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	and you consider	no
20352	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	eh n- eh	no
20353	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	all the channel	no
20354	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	to normalize	no
20355	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
20356	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	this very short eh -	no
20357	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
20358	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	"for example ""mmm mm-hmm hmm"""	no
20359	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	eh	no
20360	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And the energy is not eh height	no
20361	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	eh I think if you consider all the channel	no
20362	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	to normalize and the channel is	no
20363	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	mmm	no
20364	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	bigger	no
20365	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
20366	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	eh eh eh	no
20367	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	compared with the - with the overlapping	no
20368	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	eh duration,	no
20369	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	eh the effect	no
20370	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	is	no
20371	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	mmm	no
20372	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	stronger	no
20373	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	eh	no
20374	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	that	no
20375	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I - I mean the - the e- effect of the normalization	no
20376	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	eh with the mean and the - and the variance	no
20377	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
20378	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	eh is different that if you consider	no
20379	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	only a	no
20380	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	window	no
20381	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	compared	no
20382	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	eh with the n- the duration of overlapping.	no
20383	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Not  -	no
20384	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	You - you want it	no
20385	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	around  the overlapping part. You want it to include something that's not in  overlapping  but -	no
20386	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20387	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20388	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20389	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
20390	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	but uh	no
20391	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I - I don't know. Is - s-	no
20392	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20393	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Well it's a  sliding   window,  right? So if you take the - the measure	no
20394	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	If -	no
20395	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
20396	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20397	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	in the center of the overlapped  piece,	no
20398	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20399	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	you know, there'd better be some-	no
20400	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	something.  But if your window is  really   huge  then yeah you're right you won't even - The portion of the -	no
20401	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah,	no
20402	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	This is the -	no
20403	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	of the backchannel won't - won't effect anything. But you -	no
20404	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	This is the - the idea,	no
20405	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	to consider only the - the small window	no
20406	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah. So.	no
20407	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	near - near -	no
20408	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	near the - the overlapping zone.	no
20409	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	You know, you shouldn't be more than	no
20410	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	like -  You should  definitely  not be  three  times as big as your -	no
20411	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	as your  backchannel.	no
20412	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20413	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
20414	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Then you're gonna w- have a wash.	no
20415	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And hopefully it's more like	no
20416	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I'm not sure that's  necessarily  true.	no
20417	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	on the order of -	no
20418	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah?	no
20419	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	It  is  an  empirical  question, it seems like.	no
20420	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yea-	no
20421	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Because -	no
20422	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20423	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	because it -	no
20424	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	because	no
20425	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20426	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	um	no
20427	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	again if you're just  compensating  for the  gain,	no
20428	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	you know, the fact that this - this gain thing was crude,	no
20429	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	and the gain wh-	no
20430	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	if someone is speaking relatively	no
20431	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	at consistent  level,	no
20432	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	just to - to give a - an extreme example,	no
20433	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	all you're doing is compensating for that.	no
20434	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And  then you  still s-	no
20435	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And then if you look at the frame with  respect  to that,	no
20436	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	it still should - should uh	no
20437	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	change	no
20438	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah, it  depends  how different your normalization is, as you slide your window across. I mean.  That's  something we don't know.	no
20439	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
20440	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	It's possible to try it both ways, isn't it?	no
20441	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Well, I mean we're also talking about	no
20442	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	in this small  @@	no
20443	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	a couple of different things. I mean, one is your  analysis  window and then the other is any sort of normalization that you're doing.	no
20444	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah I was talking about the n- normalization window.	no
20445	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And the -	no
20446	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And they could be quite different.	no
20447	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20448	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20449	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Right.	no
20450	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	This was sort of where -	no
20451	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah. That's true.	no
20452	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yep.	no
20453	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	where we were  last  week.	no
20454	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20455	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But, anyway	no
20456	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	We - we'll have to look at some core things.	no
20457	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Um.	no
20458	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	O_K.	no
20459	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	O_K.	no
20460	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But that'd be great if - if you're marking those and -	no
20461	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Great.	no
20462	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	O_K.	no
20463	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	um.	no
20464	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20465	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But	no
20466	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	it  is  definitely true that we need to have the  time  marks,	no
20467	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
20468	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	and I was assuming  that  will be  inherited  because,	no
20469	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yep, I agree.	no
20470	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	if you have the words and they're roughly aligned in time	no
20471	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
20472	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	via	no
20473	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	forced alignment or whatever we end up using,	no
20474	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	then	no
20475	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	you know, this  student and I would be looking at the time	no
20476	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	marks and classifying all the frames inside those as whatever labels	no
20477	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Coming off of the other -	no
20478	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20479	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Good. So, it wouldn't be	no
20480	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Jane gave	no
20481	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I wasn't planning to label the time marks.	no
20482	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I can give you	no
20483	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I was thinking that that would come from the engineering side, yeah.	no
20484	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	my  transcription   file, no?	no
20485	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	@@	no
20486	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I don't think you  need  to.	no
20487	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah. That should be linked to the words which are linked to time somehow, right?	no
20488	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	There you go.	no
20489	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Well we're not any time  soon  going to get a forced  alignment.   So.	no
20490	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Not now.	no
20491	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20492	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Um	no
20493	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	If it's not hand-marked then we're not going to get the times.	no
20494	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Well, it's something that w-	no
20495	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Well, we - we wouldn't be able to do  any  work without a forced alignment  anyway,  so somehow if -	no
20496	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yes	no
20497	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	once he gets going we're gonna	no
20498	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	hafta come up with one and	no
20499	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yes.	no
20500	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20501	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I mean w- I guess we could do a very  bad  one with Broadcast News.	no
20502	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Good.	no
20503	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So whatever you would label would be	no
20504	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Good.	no
20505	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	attached to the words, I think.	no
20506	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Great!	no
20507	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Good, good. Mm-hmm.	no
20508	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20509	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Well again for the close  mike	no
20510	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	stuff,	no
20511	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	That might be good enough.	no
20512	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	we could come up -	no
20513	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	take a s-	no
20514	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	take the Switchboard	no
20515	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	system or something, and -	no
20516	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20517	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Um	no
20518	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	It'd be worth a try. It would be interesting to see what we get.	no
20519	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Just, you know, low-pass filter the speech and -	no
20520	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Cuz there's - there's a lot of work you can't do  without  that, I mean,	no
20521	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	how - how would you -	no
20522	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20523	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	You'd have to go in and measure every	no
20524	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	start and stop point	no
20525	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	next to a word	no
20526	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	is y- if you're interested in anything to do with words. So.	no
20527	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yep.	no
20528	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	It would be  very  inefficient.	no
20529	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20530	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
20531	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Anyway  So that'd be great.	no
20532	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Good. O_K.	no
20533	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20534	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	There's something we should	no
20535	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	talk about later but	no
20536	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	maybe not just now.	no
20537	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But, uh,	no
20538	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	should talk about our options as far as the uh	no
20539	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	uh	no
20540	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	transcription	no
20541	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yep, if I_B_M doesn't -	no
20542	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But. Well, w-	no
20543	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	O_K. Good.	no
20544	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But	no
20545	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Do we hafta  turn -	no
20546	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	we'll do that  later.	no
20547	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Are we supposed to keep recording here?	no
20548	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah. Let's do that later.	no
20549	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah  Right.	no
20550	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20551	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	We'll talk about it later.	no
20552	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20553	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So	no
20554	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	uh	no
20555	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	"Uh ""forms"".  You had something on forms."	no
20556	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Forms	no
20557	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Next iteration of forms.	no
20558	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oops.	no
20559	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oh! Oh  good,  O_K.	no
20560	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Um.	no
20561	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oh.	no
20562	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	How - So it's two pages per person?	no
20563	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Nope.	no
20564	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	One's a digit form, one's a speaker form.	no
20565	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oh!	no
20566	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So one is a one time only  speaker form and the other is the digits.	no
20567	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oh,  I  see.	no
20568	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oh it's the  same.	no
20569	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oh no no.  Is - is new  Is O_K.	no
20570	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So don't fill these out.	no
20571	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Alright.	no
20572	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	This is just the suggestion for uh what the new forms would look like.	no
20573	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So, they incorporate the changes  that we talked about.	no
20574	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Date and time.	no
20575	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Uh why did you switch the order of the Date and Time fields?	no
20576	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	This is rather a low-level, but	no
20577	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	On which one?	no
20578	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	On - on the  new  one,  Time  comes first and  then  Date,	no
20579	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	but  I  thought -	no
20580	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oh you mean on the  digit  form?	no
20581	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	This is -	no
20582	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	this is rather a low level question, but -	no
20583	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Uh, because	no
20584	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	but it  used  -  used  to be Date came  first.	no
20585	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	the user fills out the first three fields and I fill out the rest.	no
20586	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oh  I  see.	no
20587	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Well,  how  would the -	no
20588	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So it  was   intentional.  It's an interesting observation, but it was intentional.	no
20589	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	How would the user know the time if they didn't know the date?	no
20590	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Because the  date  is when you actually read the digits and the  time	no
20591	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	and, excuse me, the  time  is when you actually read the  digits,	no
20592	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	but I'm filling out the  date   beforehand.  If you look at the form in front of you?	no
20593	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	that you're going to fill out when you read the digits?	no
20594	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20595	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	you'll see I've already filled in the  date  but not the  time.	no
20596	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I  always assumed -	no
20597	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So the  time  is supposed to be pretty  exact,  because I've just been taking beginning time -	no
20598	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah, me too.	no
20599	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	time of the meeting.	no
20600	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah,	no
20601	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah, I've noticed that in the  forms.	no
20602	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I - yeah.	no
20603	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	The - the  reason  I put the  time  in, is so that the  person	no
20604	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	@@	no
20605	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Me too.	no
20606	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	who's extracting the digits, meaning me,	no
20607	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oh!	no
20608	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	will know where to look in the meeting,	no
20609	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oh dear. We've been -	no
20610	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But -	no
20611	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	to try to find the digits.	no
20612	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	we've been  messing   up  your  forms.	no
20613	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I  know.	no
20614	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I am put - I am putting the beginning of the meeting.	no
20615	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	"So you should call it, like, ""digits start time"". Or."	no
20616	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And I haven't said anything.	no
20617	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yep.	no
20618	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	in - on there .	no
20619	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Why - What - what were you putting in?	no
20620	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oh, well, I was saying if we started the meeting at	no
20621	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20622	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	two  thirty,  I'd put two thirty, and I guess d-	no
20623	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	e-  everyone  was putting two  thirty,  and	no
20624	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20625	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oh.	no
20626	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	No, it's about fifty fifty.	no
20627	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	"I didn't  realize  there was ""uh oh"	no
20628	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	"I'm about to read this and I should"" -"	no
20629	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Actually it's about one third each. About one third of them are blank,  about one third of them are when the digits are read, and about one third of them are when the  meeting starts.	no
20630	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oh.	no
20631	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So.	no
20632	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	This would be a  radical  suggestion but -	no
20633	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I could put instructions?	no
20634	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Nah.	no
20635	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Ei- either that or maybe you could	no
20636	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20637	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	maybe write down when people	no
20638	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	start reading digits on that  particular   session.	no
20639	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But if I'm not at the meeting, I can't do that.	no
20640	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I know, O_K.	no
20641	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah, he's been setting stuff up and going away. So.	no
20642	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	That's a good point.	no
20643	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I  see. Good point good point.	no
20644	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	For some reason he doesn't want to sit through every meeting that's -	no
20645	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yep, but that is the reason Name, Email and Time are where they are.	no
20646	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oh, O_K. Alright.	no
20647	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20648	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I rest my -	no
20649	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And then the others are later on.	no
20650	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Uh-huh.	no
20651	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	O_K. w-	no
20652	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And the Seat is this number?	no
20653	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
20654	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Seat and Session.	no
20655	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	"""For official use only"""	no
20656	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	That's -	no
20657	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	"""use only"""	no
20658	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Well, he's  very  professional.	no
20659	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Actually you could -	no
20660	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	"Well that  does  raise another  question,  which is why is the ""Professional use only"" line not higher?"	no
20661	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Why doesn't it come in at the point of Date and Seat?	no
20662	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oh.	no
20663	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	What?	no
20664	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Because we're filling in  other  things.	no
20665	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	What?	no
20666	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Well, because -	no
20667	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	If y-	no
20668	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	your - your professional use, you're gonna already have the date,	no
20669	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	and the s-	no
20670	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	What - which form are you talking about?	no
20671	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Well I'm comparing the  new  one with the  old  one.	no
20672	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	This is the digit form.	no
20673	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oh.	no
20674	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oh you're talking about the  digit  form. The digit form doesn't -	no
20675	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20676	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Digit.	no
20677	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Digit form.	no
20678	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oh! I wasn't supposed to -	no
20679	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20680	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Sorry.	no
20681	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	"The digit - No, that's  alright.  The digit form doesn't have a ""for official use only"" line."	no
20682	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Sorry.	no
20683	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	It just has a  line,	no
20684	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	which is what you're supposed to read.	no
20685	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	That - uh O_K.	no
20686	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	@@	no
20687	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So on the  digits  form,	no
20688	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Sorry about that. Yeah.	no
20689	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	everything  above  the line is a  fill-in  form	no
20690	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	and everything  below  the line is digits that the user  reads.	no
20691	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20692	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	O_K.	no
20693	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Alright s- but I didn't mean to derail our discussion here, so you really wanted to start with this other form.	no
20694	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	No, either way is fine I just -	no
20695	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	You just started  talking  about something, and I didn't know which  form  you were  referring  to.	no
20696	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Alright yeah, I was comparing - so th- this is -	no
20697	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So I was looking at the  change  first. So it's like we started with  this  and now we've got a  new  version of it	no
20698	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	wi-  with reference to this. So the  digit  form, we had one already.	no
20699	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Now the f- the fields	no
20700	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	are  slightly   different.	no
20701	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So the main thing that the person fills out	no
20702	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	um  is the name and email and	no
20703	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20704	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	time?	no
20705	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Right.	no
20706	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Ah!	no
20707	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	You do the rest?	no
20708	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yep.	no
20709	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Just as uh - as I have	no
20710	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Right.	no
20711	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	for all the others.	no
20712	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	What -	no
20713	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And there's an  addition  of the native  language,	no
20714	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	which is a  bit  redundant.	no
20715	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	This one has Native Language and this one does too.	no
20716	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	That's because the one, the digit form that has native language is the  old  form not the  new  form.	no
20717	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oh! Thank you.  Thank you, thank you. There we go.	no
20718	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20719	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oh,  yeah.  I'll  catch up here.	no
20720	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	O_K,  I  see.	no
20721	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	"""South Midland,  North  Midland"""	no
20722	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	That's the old and that's the new.	no
20723	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah this was the problem with these categories, I -	no
20724	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I picked those categories from TIMIT.	no
20725	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I  don't know what those are.	no
20726	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Actually,  the only way  I  know is from working with the database and having to figure it out.	no
20727	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	What -	no
20728	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	With TIMIT, yeah?	no
20729	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	uh-huh.	no
20730	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	What i-	no
20731	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So is South Midland like Kansas? and North Midland like - like uh Illinois, or - ?	no
20732	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So, I was gonna ask wh-	no
20733	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	w-	no
20734	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Well yeah.	no
20735	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20736	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Nor- um -	no
20737	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I mean. So - so what accent are  we  speaking?	no
20738	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Western?	no
20739	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	By definition?	no

20744	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Spanish?	no
20745	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	eh	no
20746	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	The original	no
20747	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	is the center of Spain and the	no
20748	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	beca-	no
20749	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah, I mean you could call it whatever you want.	no
20750	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	For the foreign language we couldn't	no
20751	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	classify every single one. So I just left it blank and you can put whatever you want.	no
20752	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Because	no
20753	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	is different, the Span- uh	no
20754	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	the Spanish language from the - the north of Spain, of the south, of the west and the -	no
20755	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Sure.	no
20756	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But.	no
20757	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So I'm not sure what to do about the Region field for English variety.	no
20758	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20759	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	"You know, when I wrote - I was writing those down, I was thinking, ""You know, these are great  if you're a  linguist ""."	no
20760	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20761	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But  I  don't know how to -  I  don't know how to -  I  don't know how to categorize them.	no
20762	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Actually even if you	no
20763	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
20764	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	t-	no
20765	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	If you're -	no
20766	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	if e-	no
20767	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	This wasn't developed by -	no
20768	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	th- these regions weren't -	no
20769	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	if y-	no

21328	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So you - this is n-  Dan's  patches, Dan Ellis's patches.	no
21329	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	The - what - the ones I applied, that you can actually do are Dan's, because it doesn't slow it down.	no
21330	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	M-	no
21331	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Fantastic!	no
21332	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Just uses a lot of memory.	no
21333	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	"So when you say "" slow "", does that mean to -"	no
21334	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	No, the - the one that's installed is fine. It's not slow at all.	no
21335	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I  wrote another version.	no
21336	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Which, instead of having the  one  pane with the  one  view,	no
21337	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	It has  multiple  panes  with the views.	no
21338	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
21339	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
21340	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But the  problem  with it	no
21341	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	is the  drawing  of those  waveforms  is  so   slow	no
21342	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	that every time you do  anything  it just crawls.	no
21343	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
21344	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	It's really bad.	no
21345	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	It's -	no
21346	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So, it - it's the redrawing of the w-	no
21347	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	That's a consideration.	no
21348	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
21349	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	oh uh-huh,	no
21350	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	w- as you move.	no
21351	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	As you  play,  as you  move,  as you  scroll.	no
21352	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Just about  anything,  and it - it was so slow it was not usable.	no
21353	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And this'll be a -	no
21354	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So that's why I didn't install it and didn't pursue it.	no
21355	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	hav- having the multiwave will be a big help cuz -	no
21356	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	in terms of like disentangling overlaps and things,	no
21357	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oh  yeah.	no
21358	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	that'll be a  big  help.	no
21359	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So.	no
21360	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
21361	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I  think  that the one Dan has is usable enough.	no
21362	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	It doesn't  display  the others. It  displays  just the mixed signal.	no
21363	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
21364	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But you can  listen  to any of them.	no
21365	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	That's excellent. He also has version control which is another nice	no
21366	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
21367	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	e- so you -	no
21368	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	No, he  suggested  that, but he didn't -	no
21369	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	e- the patches that you -	no
21370	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	It's not installed.	no
21371	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oh, I  thought  it was in one of those  patches.	no
21372	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	No.	no
21373	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	No.	no
21374	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oh O_K.	no
21375	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Well.	no
21376	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So is there any hope for actually displaying	no
21377	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Alright.	no
21378	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	the wave form?	no
21379	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Um, not if we're going to use Tcl-T_K	no
21380	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	O_K.	no
21381	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	At least not if we're going to use  Snack.	no
21382	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I mean you would have to do something ourselves.	no
21383	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Well, or use the one that crawls.	no
21384	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	O_K.	no
21385	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Well, I'm -	no
21386	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I  probably   would   be   trying  to  use   the  -	no
21387	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	whatever's  there.  And	no
21388	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Why don't we - we  see  how Dan's works and if it -	no
21389	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	it's useful to have the -	no
21390	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
21391	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	If we really need the display -	no
21392	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I mean.	no
21393	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I wonder - I'm just wondering if we can  display  things other than the  wave  form. So. Suppose we have a  feature  -	no
21394	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	a  feature  stream.	no
21395	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And it's just, you know, a - a	no
21396	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
21397	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	uni-dimensional feature,	no
21398	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	varying in time.	no
21399	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And we want to plot  that,  instead of the whole wave form.	no
21400	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I mean.	no
21401	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
21402	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	That might be faster. Right? So.	no
21403	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
21404	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	We - we could  do  that but that would mean changing	no
21405	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	the code.	no
21406	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I mean this isn't a program  we  wrote.	no
21407	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
21408	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	This is a program that we got from someone else,	no
21409	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	O_K.	no
21410	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	and we've done  patches  on.	no
21411	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	O_K.	no
21412	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
21413	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
21414	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Well, I'll talk to you about it and we can see but	no
21415	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Cou-	no
21416	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So.	no
21417	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
21418	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	i- e-	no
21419	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I mean, y-	no
21420	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	it's  definitely   great to have the other one. That's -	no
21421	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	If there was some -	no
21422	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Is there some  way  to  have someone write	no
21423	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	patches	no
21424	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	in something faster and -	no
21425	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	and -	no
21426	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	link it  in,  or something? Or is that -	no
21427	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Not easily. I mean y-  yes  we could  do  that. You could - you can write	no
21428	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	widgets in C_.	no
21429	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
21430	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And try to do it that way but I just don't think -	no
21431	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	it -	no
21432	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Let's  try  it with Dan's and if that isn't  enough,	no
21433	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Right.	no
21434	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	we can do it otherwise. I  think  it  is,  cuz when I was  playing  with it, the  mixed  signal has it all  in  there.	no
21435	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And so it's really - It's not too bad to find places in the - in the stream	no
21436	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	O_K.	no
21437	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	where things are happening.	no
21438	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And it's also -	no
21439	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Hmm?	no
21440	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So I - I don't think it'll be bad.	no
21441	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	also the case that - that uh this  multi-wave   thing	no
21442	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	is proposed to the -	no
21443	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So. Dan proposed it to the Transcriber central people,	no
21444	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	and it's likely that uh - So. And - and	no
21445	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	they responded favorably looks as though it will be incorporated in the future version.	no
21446	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oh.	no
21447	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	They said that the only reason they hadn't had the multi- the parallel	no
21448	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	uh  stream  one  before  was simply that	no
21449	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	they hadn't had time to do it.	no
21450	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And uh	no
21451	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
21452	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	so it's likely that this - this may be entered into the ch- this central	no
21453	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	@@ .	no
21454	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	They may well have  not  had much  demand  for it.	no
21455	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	And if - if -	no
21456	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Well that's - that's - that's true, too.	no
21457	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
21458	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	This is a -	no
21459	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
21460	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So. You mean they could - they could do it and it would be  fast enough if  they  do it? Or - ?	no
21461	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	a useful thing for  us.	no
21462	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oh. No.	no
21463	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Depends on how much  work  they did.	no
21464	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I just mean - I just mean that it's - that - that his - So.	no
21465	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oh .	no
21466	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	This one that	no
21467	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	we now have	no
21468	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
21469	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	does  have the status of	no
21470	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	potentially being incorporated	no
21471	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	l-  likely  being incorporated into the central code.	no
21472	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	O_K.	no
21473	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Now, tha- Now, if we develop  further	no
21474	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	then, y- uh, I don't -	no
21475	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I mean it's - I think it's a nice feature to have it -	no
21476	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I think if - if - if one of us sat down and  coded  it, so that it could be  displayed  fast enough	no
21477	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	set that way.	no
21478	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I'm sure they would be  quite  willing to  incorporate  it.	no
21479	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
21480	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But it's  not  a trivial  task.	no
21481	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	O_K.	no
21482	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm. Yeah.	no
21483	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I just like the idea of it being something that's,	no
21484	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	you know, tied back into the  original,  so that other people can benefit from it.	no
21485	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
21486	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
21487	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	However. I  also  understand that you can have	no
21488	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	widgets that are  very  useful for their purpose and that you don't need to	no
21489	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	always go that w- route.	no
21490	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
21491	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	O_K.	no
21492	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	anyway, shall we do digits?	no
21493	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
21494	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah. Let's do digits,	yes
21495	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah. Let's do digits,	no
21496	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	uh, and then we'll turn off the mikes, and then I have one other thing to discuss.	no
21497	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	O_K.	no
21498	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I actually have to leave. So.	no
21499	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	O_K.	no
21500	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Um.	no
21501	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I mean  I had to leave at three thirty,	no
21502	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Uh-oh.	no
21503	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	so I can -	no
21504	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oh.	no
21505	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	O_K.	no
21506	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Well, you want to go  first?  Or.	no
21507	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Well, I can wait  for the digits but I	no
21508	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	can't   stay  for the  discussion  I c-	no
21509	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I have to make a  call.	no
21510	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So.	no
21511	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	O_K. Well, we'll talk to you about it -	no
21512	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Well, should we - e- should we switch off the g-	no
21513	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Um.	no
21514	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Do you wanna go do digits or do you wanna just  skip  digits?	no
21515	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	No, I can do digits  if  -	no
21516	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Then -	no
21517	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	if -	no
21518	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But I don't wanna butt  in,	no
21519	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Alright.	no
21520	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	or something.	no
21521	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	You go ahead.	no
21522	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	But if there's something on the  rest  of the -	no
21523	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	I'm - I'll be around just have to make call before quarter of. So.	no
21524	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Mm-hmm.	no
21525	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Uh	no
21526	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	So I -	no
21527	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Or we can talk about it.	no
21528	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Ke-	no
21529	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Why don't you read the digits?	no
21530	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	O_K.  Alright.	no
21531	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah, why don't you read the digits and then you can  go.	no
21532	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Oh, this is the new one.	no
21533	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah.	no
21534	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Yeah, don't -	no
21535	transcript	transcript_Bmr009	Alright.	no

21657	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21658	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So you see  the  -	no
21659	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I just  tried  it. I think my  head is too big.	no
21660	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So.	no
21661	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	My head's too big, also.  It's too ba-	no
21662	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And there  is  a problem that you can hear it come and go,	no
21663	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	cuz when you turn your head, then	no
21664	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	you drift away from the microphone.	no
21665	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Oh yeah.	no
21666	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21667	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Oh, that's true.	no
21668	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K	yes
21669	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Oh, that's true.	no
21670	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K	no
21671	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	so  let's uh	no
21672	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	The distance isn't -	no
21673	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	course that's true of a lapel as well.	no
21674	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Let's discuss agenda items.  What did we have?	no
21675	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I should have brought more -	no
21676	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yes.	no
21677	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	uh  You - you were	no
21678	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I have a  couple things about speaker form -	no
21679	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	announce some things	no
21680	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	about forms in general.	no
21681	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K, forms	no
21682	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	is one thing  uh, there's	no
21683	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	status on  on the uh	no
21684	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	transcription	no
21685	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	discussion   which will take us about thirty seconds	no
21686	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Stuff.	no
21687	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	uh	no
21688	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and then uh Jose  as usual	no
21689	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	uh, the one among us who's actually doing a bunch of things on this	no
21690	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	uh	no
21691	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	He has  this and I think we can have some -	no
21692	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I was just  glancing through it, so I think we	no
21693	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	have something to discuss  about.	no
21694	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
21695	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	um	no
21696	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and	no
21697	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	um	no
21698	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	We just sent in that uh	no
21699	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	N_S_F pre-proposal but I don't think there's much to say about that except	no
21700	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	we've sent it in and	no
21701	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	we'll see what happens	no
21702	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	um	no
21703	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Anybody? Anything?	no
21704	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Anything else  going on? No. O_K.	no
21705	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	That's it.	no
21706	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So	no
21707	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Why don't we do it in that order?  Go ahead.	no
21708	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K.	yes
21709	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Why don't we do it in that order?  Go ahead.	no
21710	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K.	no
21711	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I uh  probably should have printed out more of these.	no
21712	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So one of the things that I've been doing with the digits forms is I've been adding more and more speaker specific information to them and it's getting pretty crowded and you have to fill it out each time.	no
21713	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So, what I  thought  was, it would be nice to have a single speaker form that you fill out once.	no
21714	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And then, on the digits form you just have to put your name down	no
21715	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and you can look it up from the speaker form.	no
21716	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	so, I had a first pass of it,	no
21717	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and I	no
21718	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	spoke with Jane a bit about how to specify	no
21719	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	what language and education and that sort of stuff and so I have a first pass at it.	no
21720	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And I was uh just wondering if people had any comments on information that should or shouldn't be on it.	no
21721	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And I  only did one copy which was really stupid of me.	no
21722	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	um	no
21723	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So I'll just sort of  say  what it's on and then I can hand it around.	no
21724	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So the top of it is	no
21725	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	uh, Name, Sex	no
21726	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Email or Other Contact Information.	no
21727	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And I put the contact information just in case we have people with the same name,	no
21728	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	so that you can distinguish them,	no
21729	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and then also just to have a  separate  contact from the consent form.	no
21730	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And then, uh, we talked a little bit about whether to do -	no
21731	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	how we get at the background.	no
21732	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And we could  do  profession, but	no
21733	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	it's  so  uniform	no
21734	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	that we figured what was more important	no
21735	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	was  actually the education level.	no
21736	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	um	no
21737	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	At least that would get at  some  idea of their background. So I have a -	no
21738	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well -	no
21739	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and it's also relevant to status.	no
21740	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I c- I can insert that.	no
21741	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And s- and relevant to status.	no
21742	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
21743	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So that  what I have is	no
21744	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	uh	no
21745	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Status?	no
21746	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Which might in- af- affect the discourse aspects.	no
21747	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So, go ahead.	no
21748	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Oh - oh, stats kind of status, O_K.	no
21749	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	His - Uh-huh. Yeah.	no
21750	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So - uh, I have uh,	no
21751	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Categories.	no
21752	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	five things that you can  circle,	no
21753	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Undergrad, Grad,	no
21754	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Post-doc, Professor, and then Other, with a colon and a place where you can fill in if there's some Other.	no
21755	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So I think the  problem  with that is that there's not a necessarily easy equivalent for our  visitors,	no
21756	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	who are  not used to the	no
21757	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	U_S education levels.	no
21758	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and  may need some	no
21759	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	help to translate what that means.	no
21760	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	How fine a resolution do you  need  on that	no
21761	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	for this?	no
21762	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I mean	no
21763	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Is the question.	no
21764	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	maybe not so  much.	no
21765	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
21766	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Student, Non-student.	no
21767	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Oh  I think undergrad  is useful.	no
21768	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"Can you just write something like ""position""?"	no
21769	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and people can fill in their own  you know,	no
21770	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	P- prone.	no
21771	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21772	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"""Post-doc"" or  ""visitor"" or whatever."	no
21773	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Sitting.	no
21774	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	@@	no
21775	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, the problem with that is	no
21776	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	um, I think the same as the problem of  profession.	no
21777	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"That it - it will be - there will be a tendency all - for everyone to put down ""speech researcher"" or -"	no
21778	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	or something at that granularity.	no
21779	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	oh.	no
21780	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So	no
21781	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I  don't  think there's a problem  asking  the education level, I th-	no
21782	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	At least  I  don't feel like there is.	no
21783	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	um	no
21784	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I think the only  question  is whether the - what  categories  should there be.	no
21785	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21786	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I think that - so	no
21787	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Uh - did - are - were you suggesting that it should be  more  fine grained than this?	no
21788	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	No, no.  Less.	no
21789	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Less.	no
21790	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Less?  What would you suggest as a - as a change?	no
21791	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Um,	no
21792	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Hmm	no
21793	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	um	no
21794	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	well, do you think there's -	no
21795	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I don't really know.	no
21796	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I mean, were you thinking, uh, that it	no
21797	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	would be useful for some research later	no
21798	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	to know say, you said undergrad for instance, so, undergrad versus grad, do you think that's important?	no
21799	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
21800	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
21801	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I do, and the reason is because I think that	no
21802	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K.	no
21803	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	um, well having been a grad  student as, yeah,	no
21804	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	a-  as others here,	no
21805	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	at - at Berkeley,	no
21806	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	that, um,	no
21807	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I think there's almost like a quantum leap from undergrad to grad	no
21808	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	in terms of like the  status.	no
21809	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I mean , I mean you notice it in various ways, like	no
21810	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	simply  trying to meet with a professor during office hours.	no
21811	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	You know, in - in my department it was always the case grad students had a  huge	no
21812	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	amount of different priority, and were treated as equals, g- and -	no
21813	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and help- helpers, you know, in - in	no
21814	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	research, uh	no
21815	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	uh c- uh	no
21816	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	roles and things that they -	no
21817	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	that they - In terms of like the s- the social dynamics of interactions,	no
21818	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
21819	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I would expect them to be	no
21820	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	less deferent.	no
21821	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and  um	no
21822	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I see.	no
21823	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	maybe  less assertive of their own views and things like that.	no
21824	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I don't  think that we're going to  have  a lot of undergrads,	no
21825	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right.	no
21826	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	unless we  branch out to different types of meetings, but -	no
21827	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	How about -	no
21828	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	You could say, if you're giving a talk, how likely are you to be challenged?	no
21829	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	This is the  dimension.	no
21830	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, this is the dimension.	no
21831	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, one of the - one of the criteria	no
21832	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah, but -	no
21833	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	One  -  one  dimension.	no
21834	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I had for designing this form, is that I didn't want a separate instruction sheet.	no
21835	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21836	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And so we'll get to that in a moment when we talk about language also.	no
21837	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
21838	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Is I did  not  want to have to, you know come down and quiz each person and have a	no
21839	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	uh	no
21840	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	social dynamics expert	no
21841	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	being the one who's filling out the answers. I want it to be  self-evaluating.  You	no
21842	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	can give it to them and they can understand what you're asking.	no
21843	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
21844	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And it's non-threatening, I mean, this - this compared to, you know,	no
21845	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yep.	no
21846	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	wh- exactly what level of professorship, and -  and -	no
21847	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well,  sounds  like you really need to  know  something kind of like that. You need to know sort of	no
21848	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Bas- in- in this meeting,	no
21849	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	sort of what is your social status?	no
21850	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	That's a separate question.	no
21851	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So, we'll -	no
21852	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	We'll	no
21853	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well,  I   agree  with him, though. I - Yeah.	no
21854	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	get to that in a moment.	no
21855	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	But I - I agree that this is	no
21856	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	that w-	no
21857	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	the rea- the motivation was	no
21858	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	things that could affect social dynamics in ways that are relevant to the research	no
21859	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	without being threatening to the person.	no
21860	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	But - but - but it's gonna  depend  on who's -	no
21861	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And this  particular  form -	no
21862	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I  know.  So, this  particular  form	no
21863	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	is speaker -	no
21864	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	is dependent only on the speaker, not on the  meeting.	no
21865	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21866	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
21867	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	You could imagine then having  another  form	no
21868	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	that you might want to do  during  a meeting	no
21869	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	to get out the relationships -	no
21870	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
21871	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21872	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	But  then  that's interfering with the  meeting.	no
21873	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So, what I  like  about  this  information is you give it to them once,	no
21874	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and they fill it out  once,	no
21875	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and - and then you  have  that  information.	no
21876	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	well,	no
21877	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and we - also discussed the idea of having	no
21878	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I-	no
21879	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I g-	no
21880	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	the separate D_T_ Ds  would handle	no
21881	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	maybe, s- specific - meeting-specific things that might be relevant.	no
21882	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	D_T_D?	no
21883	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	uh, the data, so that, you know, his X_M_L thing?	no
21884	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Oh.	no
21885	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	You got	no
21886	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	the Data Type Definition -	no
21887	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Oh, O_K.	no
21888	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	the Document Type Definition p- part	no
21889	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Ah.	no
21890	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21891	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21892	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	that it's - can s- be used for relational things, yeah.	no
21893	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	D_T_D.	no
21894	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I guess -	no
21895	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	See-	no
21896	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I guess it seems to me like you know I - trying to	no
21897	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	deduce information about the person's status	no
21898	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	from the meeting independent form  will be  useless  because -	no
21899	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Not  at  all.  I mean, the fact that	no
21900	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	one person's an undergrad and the other's a full professor is interesting.	no
21901	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So, the question is how much of this information	no
21902	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	um,	no
21903	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	But, that will  depend  on what the  meeting's  about,	no
21904	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	can y-	no
21905	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	right? Let's say the undergrad was an expert in physics, and -	no
21906	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well,  absolutely!	no
21907	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	@@	no
21908	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	But - but you  want  to have that  information.	no
21909	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21910	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right? So, if you don't have that information,	no
21911	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
21912	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	how are you gonna do  anything?	no
21913	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I guess I'm wondering  how  can you make a  conclusion	no
21914	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	yeah	no
21915	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	based  on that,	no
21916	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Where'd  -	no
21917	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	This is just -	no
21918	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	if you  don't  know about the meeting?	no
21919	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, you know, we're - we're talking at - at a general level of description. You can  always  get more specific.	no
21920	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	yeah	no
21921	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And, it may be -	no
21922	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I mean, so what would you suggest?	no
21923	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I  don't  know.  I'm just -	no
21924	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	That's why I was  wondering about if you can put something about the d-	no
21925	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right.	no
21926	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	@@  -	no
21927	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Can you repeat the categories you had? Maybe they're fine.	no
21928	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21929	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Undergrad, Grad, Post-doc, Professor, Other	no
21930	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So that, yeah, I think that's fine	no
21931	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	except the one	no
21932	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	thing is there are a lot of ICSI v- like I don't know what I would be here, just	no
21933	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I'm not a professor  I'm not a -	no
21934	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"oh, that's right, you know I was saying ""Professor""."	no
21935	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So - so anything that, like a Visitor r- ICSI Visitor or, ICSI y- I mean a	no
21936	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Uh-huh.	no
21937	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Visiting S-	no
21938	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"Yeah, when I said ""Professor"", I guess what I was thinking in my mind was more"	no
21939	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Researcher or whatever.	no
21940	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"""P_H_D but not Post-doc""."	no
21941	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	How about -	no
21942	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So if -	no
21943	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah, how about	no
21944	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and  -	no
21945	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Post-P_H_D researcher or something	no
21946	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	if we can put something -	no
21947	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah, that - then -	no
21948	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	then  I think what you have is  great.	no
21949	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21950	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right?	no
21951	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	for - for that purpose  and  -	no
21952	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So, change -	no
21953	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"Would we change ""Post-doc"" to"	no
21954	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"""Post-P_H_D Researcher""?"	no
21955	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	or just -	no
21956	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Or maybe Post-doc	no
21957	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"change ""Post-doc"" to ""P_H_D""?"	no
21958	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	You could say -	no
21959	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Because I think P_H_D and Professor are d- are	no
21960	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21961	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	distinct aren't they?	no
21962	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21963	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Wait, what's a P_H_D?	no
21964	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	It's possible.	no
21965	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Like, if you have a P_H_D	no
21966	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Someone who has a P_H_D.	no
21967	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and you're  hanging around here, and you're not a professor	no
21968	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and you're not a post-doc, then that's like what we are	no
21969	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	so	no
21970	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah so for - for me there's - there's a -	no
21971	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	There's a bunch of people like that.	no
21972	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	There are people -	no
21973	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Um, this got very tricky in fact when we got involved with the  Spanish  program	no
21974	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	actually because	no
21975	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"uh, when we said, in our original forms, ""post-doc"""	no
21976	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	what we were used to, from the German program and from the U_S standard,	no
21977	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21978	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"when you say ""post-doc"" it meant somebody who had  just  gotten a P_H_D"	no
21979	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right.	no
21980	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	who was doing one year someplace.	no
21981	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	But when we did the  Spanish  call,	no
21982	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21983	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"many people said ""oh I want to be"	no
21984	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"uh - have a post-doc slot"" and they were"	no
21985	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21986	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	twenty years out	no
21987	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"because they were ""post"""	no
21988	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right.	no
21989	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21990	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right.	no
21991	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"their  ""doc"""	no
21992	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah. Yeah.	no
21993	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
21994	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So, you can say Post-P_H_D Researcher or	no
21995	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	so	no
21996	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Sure.	no
21997	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I - I - I think that -	no
21998	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	what-  if there's one more category that's sort of	no
21999	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right.	no
22000	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	It might be hard to do a finer thing than that because whether somebody is going to be dominant in a meeting	no
22001	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	general like that.	no
22002	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	is really	no
22003	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I think it's going to be  so  clouded by everything else - Someone who's	no
22004	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	just  gotten their P_H_D	no
22005	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	uh, could be very very	no
22006	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	uh, strongly opinionated about something and somebody who's been twenty years out	no
22007	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	could be shy, you know, s-	no
22008	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So, maybe Undergrad, Grad,	no
22009	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm. That's true.	no
22010	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
22011	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Post-P_H_D and Other?	no
22012	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"What's  ""Other""?"	no
22013	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	um, other -	no
22014	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	For the European -	no
22015	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	It's just to allow.	no
22016	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yep.	no
22017	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	If i-	no
22018	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	You- I think you could keep Professor, but you could say Post P_H_D Researcher or something.	no
22019	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	It could be st- It could be -	no
22020	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Instead of -	no
22021	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	instead of -	no
22022	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	instead of  Professor  or instead of  Post-doc?	no
22023	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	No, instead of Post - Post-doc or Post-P_H_D,	no
22024	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	just wrap all the people that are post P_H_D	no
22025	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and non-professors together.	no
22026	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	so you want Professor to be in a separate category, you think -	no
22027	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	you think uh -	no
22028	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So,	no
22029	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I think  professors  probably want it  I don't  care.	no
22030	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	think - think we -	no
22031	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	as I said Undergrad -	no
22032	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Undergrad, Grad, Post-P_H_D, Professor, Other?	no
22033	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
22034	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, yeah the Post-P_H_D one is the one that can be, like	no
22035	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Post-	no
22036	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Post-doc or Post-P_H_D Researcher or	no
22037	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
22038	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	whatever. Yeah.	no
22039	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right.	no
22040	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Then it'd be fine.	no
22041	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So, I'm te- I'm tending to push toward simpler even though I know that  more  detailed means	no
22042	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I think it's fine.	no
22043	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	more  potential information for someone later who's doing research  in - in this area	no
22044	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I - uh - The - the - the thing	no
22045	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	making me lean toward simpler where possible is that	no
22046	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	uh  the more a thing -	no
22047	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Many of the meetings that we record	no
22048	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	uh,  may  be the kind where we just record somebody  once	no
22049	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	even though  we want to get a  lot  of data that has	no
22050	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	uh,  many  meetings with the same people.	no
22051	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And so the more forms we have and the more lines in the forms	no
22052	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	that's th- the more overhead for that one time thing makes it harder to do.	no
22053	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	That's true.	no
22054	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, the  whole  reason that I'm  doing  it this way is - is uh - my experience  so  far has been the exact  reverse.	no
22055	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right.  That's what we've done so far.	no
22056	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	That -	no
22057	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right. And so I'm saying I expect us to do both kinds.	no
22058	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right.	no
22059	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I guess we could have another type of  form   for	no
22060	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
22061	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	less frequent.	no
22062	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, one thing, so you understand he -	no
22063	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	he d- he wants you to do this only once for each person?	no
22064	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yes.	no
22065	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K, O_K.	no
22066	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So I'm saying there are going to be -	no
22067	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So.	no
22068	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	What I imagine once we've collected a  lot  of data,	no
22069	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	a chunk of it will be	no
22070	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	uh, the same people many times	no
22071	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and another chunk of it will be people -  random  meetings that we got with	no
22072	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
22073	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
22074	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
22075	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
22076	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	from different  people  and I think it's use- We've talked about this before, it's useful to have both kinds of data.	no
22077	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I think.	no
22078	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well I think that if - if we're  planning  to do that,	no
22079	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	then we should probably have another set of forms.	no
22080	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K.	no
22081	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	You know, a  single  form that's the consent form	no
22082	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and the speaker information form and not have them do digits.	no
22083	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K.	no
22084	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	No, I  like  the idea of putting down the -	no
22085	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	the  status  information because I think you probably can get a lot of	no
22086	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
22087	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
22088	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	interest- there can be a lot of interesting  research  on that.	no
22089	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I'm wondering	no
22090	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	could we  add  something to the  form  that gets filled out at  each  meeting	no
22091	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	that would somehow -	no
22092	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	This is a topic I want to bring up   after  I get through this.	no
22093	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
22094	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K.	no
22095	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So, that - that - that's  another  form that I want to discuss.	no
22096	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	um,	no
22097	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	with the digits forms. So, s- can we get -	no
22098	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well -	no
22099	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I guess I was thinking	no
22100	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	maybe, you know how you were taking information  off  of the digits and putting it onto that? Could we	no
22101	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
22102	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	put one more thing on here maybe?	no
22103	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	That's what I want to talk about in a -	no
22104	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah, I'm - I have that as a topic, also.	no
22105	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K.	no
22106	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So, let's finish with the  speaker  form -	no
22107	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Cuz you said separate forms so I thought maybe -	no
22108	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	speaker form and then we'll get over  o- get over to that one.	no
22109	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K.	no
22110	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So, Education Level, Undergrad, Grad, Post-P_H_D, Professor, Other.	no
22111	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K?	no
22112	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K.	no
22113	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	um	no
22114	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"and then I put ""Optional"""	no
22115	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"with a big ""Optional"" in parentheses, Age."	no
22116	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Wait, why is that optional?	no
22117	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Because I think a lot of people are  sensitive  to it and won't want to write it  down.	no
22118	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
22119	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
22120	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So I don't want to make them feel like they have to.	no
22121	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I don't know.	no
22122	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	It - it would be very good to get age for a lot of purposes.	no
22123	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
22124	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I mean	no
22125	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Uh,  sure.  But if someone doesn't want to write it down I don't want them to say you can't record me -	no
22126	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	a lot of corpora -	no
22127	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	yeah, so we ca- we have these age ranges or something?	no
22128	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Oh, right.	no
22129	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well it -	no
22130	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, wait - wait - wait - wait a minute, um,	no
22131	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	You know, like -	no
22132	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	It's not illegal or anything right, it's not pushing on anything unethical or illegal, whatever, to ask for their age, right?	no
22133	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	No, not at all, every - most corpora have that, you know,	no
22134	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So -	no
22135	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I suggest you ask for their age	no
22136	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	information.	no
22137	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and if they say I don't want to give it say O_K.	no
22138	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	In - in like the London-Lund  they -	no
22139	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
22140	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	they - the researchers  themselves  estimate the age afterw- after the fact. So they say, you know, uh	no
22141	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	middle thirties,	no
22142	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	you know  fifties or sixties, and they -	no
22143	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
22144	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and they just - they estimate  for  the person	no
22145	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	But -	no
22146	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, I think that just having on the form -	no
22147	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	saying Optional, Age,	no
22148	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	again means  I  don't have to be  sitting  here and explaining the  form  every time we  do  this.	no
22149	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	yeah, that's O_K.	no
22150	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
22151	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And it isn't - it isn't  that  boldf-	no
22152	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And having a little  instruction  sheet and say	no
22153	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"""If you're in this age- range do this, and if you're in this rage do that."""	no
22154	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I see.	no
22155	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
22156	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
22157	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"And it's - and it  isn't  really that  prominent.  It's - you know his ""Optional"" is not really boldface, but -"	no
22158	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So.	no
22159	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	How about -	no
22160	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"How about ""optional but highly desirable""?"	no
22161	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
22162	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Please, please!	no

22291	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	difference, but -	no

22298	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
22299	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So the - the  for	no
22300	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	the non-na- for the native English speakers we have  Variety  of English and Region.	no
22301	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
22302	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And that's it.	no
22303	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And that's partly to pick up - Yeah.	no
22304	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And then  we have  another  form later down which is	no
22305	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	um, list other language influences.	no
22306	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	S- Mm-hmm	no
22307	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So what does Region mean	no
22308	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah, I was just gonna ask the same thing.	no
22309	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and like	no
22310	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	if  I  see this form I wouldn't be quite sure what you mean by	no
22311	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Region.	no
22312	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Region -	no
22313	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right, neither would I.	no
22314	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Do you want to have - give choices and have them circle one, or, I mean	no
22315	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, we -	no
22316	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Um,  I don't think we can do that because it would be different for -	no
22317	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Does that mean region of -	no
22318	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	When we - when we discussed it it was - it was	no
22319	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	where - where you lived during your childhood and adolescence.	no
22320	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Region of the U_S, or region of the world -	no
22321	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	If you're  American  English it would be region of the U_S.	no

22324	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	It's -	no
22325	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	but I mean.	no
22326	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	W- it's where you lived.	no
22327	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	That - that - so that's why I didn't have  circle  forms. Because	no
22328	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	it would be different depending on	no
22329	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	what your language is. So -	no
22330	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Do you mean state,  or do you mean more broad than the state level?	no
22331	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Hmm.	no
22332	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	You mean like you know	no
22333	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	southern U_S, or northeastern or	no
22334	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	It- I think it would be however you would identify	no
22335	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	your own. And, as I said I don't really see a way of doing a  circle	no
22336	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	fill  in, because there would be -	no
22337	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	there would have to be one for American English, one for British English, one for	no
22338	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
22339	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	you know, one for each type.	no
22340	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	If you wanted to get regions for American English you could copy what they did in TIMIT.	no
22341	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, and also -	no
22342	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	They had divided things up into	no
22343	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	But - but  that would mean I would have to do - generate a different form	no
22344	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	regions.	no
22345	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	for circles, if you're American English or British English or Indian English.	no
22346	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	No, no. It would only be f-	no
22347	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	if you said American English	no
22348	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	yeah maybe  not  for the  others,  because there aren't going to be enough	no
22349	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	then you'd put the regions. For the others, you would just leave it.	no
22350	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	people to really group them	no
22351	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah. We wouldn't have enough to really make them -	no
22352	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	difference on those.	no
22353	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well -	no
22354	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and you know when you talk about dialects in England, I mean, that's really -	no
22355	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Every block of  London has a different -	no
22356	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Hmm.	no
22357	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	so.	no
22358	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
22359	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I haven't  seen  what - what they did in TIMIT.	no
22360	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	My Fair Lady's  -	no
22361	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Are you s- Do they have a bunch of options like uh -	no
22362	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Oh, it's like six regions of the country or something. Very - just a limited number and then	no
22363	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
22364	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I see.	no
22365	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K.	no
22366	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
22367	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	if you're American you would just circle	no
22368	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, that's the concept, yeah.	no
22369	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	the region	no
22370	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
22371	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah, and Henry Higgins could say which block you were from.	no

22373	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	where -	no
22374	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right? So that's -	no
22375	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
22376	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	That's right.	no
22377	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well that - you know that was the concept of having the  region  thing, I -	no
22378	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	It would be no problem to  change  it to  options  if um - if  that  were  desirable.  Although for different	no
22379	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah, I just don't know what to do about the other	no
22380	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	varieties of English.	no
22381	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, that's true.  I mean, Indian English I wouldn't know f-	no
22382	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	You'd just leave them.	no
22383	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	You don't even ask.	no
22384	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I - I - there are  huge  differences	no
22385	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	what  -	no
22386	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	you know	no
22387	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, that's why I wanted to just leave it something that you could write it down.	no
22388	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	in the others so it might be	no
22389	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	better to just do it for the	no
22390	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	yeah you could leave region for -	no
22391	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	for the others but have  circled choice for the American  English.	no
22392	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	One - one good reason to use the  TIMIT  ones is if anybody asks you	no
22393	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"you know, about the data later on you can say ""well I chose these"	no
22394	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"based on TIMIT"","	no

22398	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And -	no
22399	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	just doing	no
22400	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	the - the sort of the Steve suggestion,	no
22401	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	uh, as - as an add-on to it, right? Rather than saying Region,	no
22402	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	just say	no

22404	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"here and here?"""	no
22405	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	That  was the  concept  of region.	no
22406	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And that would apply to everybody then?	no
22407	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah. And then you could  map  those to the TIMIT regions  later,  if people wanted to.	no
22408	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Just -	no
22409	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and -	no
22410	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
22411	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	It's just the  wording  of it.	no
22412	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And then they - they could s-	no

22420	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Actually	no
22421	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	that  is  true for them but it means that you're gonna get a bunch of different  level   -	no
22422	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	levels of resolution in your survey, it - it'll be more of a pain later, so.	no
22423	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Somebody's gonna have to do some data -	no

22430	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	First of all some people take - you-	no
22431	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	A lot of post-processing.	no
22432	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, and some people would give you more specific	no
22433	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	information than others and that's a  waste  because you can only use	no
22434	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	the least common denominator of specificity and	no
22435	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah but that -	no
22436	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	but the good thing about it is it - is it frees you from coming up with exactly what the right	no
22437	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	generally .	no
22438	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	categories  are.	no
22439	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	um,	no
22440	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right?	no
22441	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I don't know later on, if - if somebody just says Midwest, now all these other people who said	no
22442	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
22443	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	you know area- then	no
22444	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	that'll have to become your category.	no
22445	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and it's -	no
22446	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	It's harder later on, i- I -	no
22447	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I see.	no
22448	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	There  is  another  problem.	no
22449	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	It's easier for the  person  but it's harder for the r- it	no
22450	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	actually  less  informative for us because you can't enforce	no
22451	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	any minimum level of specificity.	no
22452	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	But I think that if you're going to have it be general	no
22453	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	so it's -	no
22454	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	uh, so the idea again was, you know, you might wanna  also  know if -	no
22455	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	if they grew up in Germany or if they grew up -	no
22456	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and so  uh, I think  you wanna -	no
22457	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	The idea - the motivation I think for this being suggested  before  was that it did cover a range of these cases that might	no
22458	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	um -	no
22459	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	you know, if you say your native	no
22460	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	language was - was English but uh  you	no
22461	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	you grew up in Germany, uh	no
22462	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah, y- there  is  actu - you made me think about another wrinkle	no
22463	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I think this -	no
22464	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	in this whole thing, which is that  just asking them where they grew up	no
22465	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	between certain ages isn't enough, because	no
22466	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
22467	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	somebody could grow up in Germany but live on an army base	no
22468	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.  Or someone could in Geor- in - in New York and have, I mean, any  number  of different types of  speech patterns.	no
22469	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	speaking English.	no
22470	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Or their parents live - yeah.	no
22471	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah, so you sort of have to say what languages were spoken in the home between the ages of -	no
22472	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and their parents -	no
22473	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, we have this - We hafta - So. He hasn't given you the  overview,	no
22474	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	but you have, like, the  Native  Speaker category, the  Non-native  Speaker  category, and then you have	no
22475	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Other Language Influences, for example bilingual dialects, th- things like that.	no
22476	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Oh that's nice, O_K.	no
22477	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Now there's this  issue  of	no
22478	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	not wa- like  you're  saying,	no
22479	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	you don't want the forms to be hugely complicated and take half the  meeting  to complete.	no
22480	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
22481	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So,	no
22482	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	it's trying to - e- there's this - trying to - trying to hold this  balance  between the amount of information  needed  and	no
22483	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	uh, you know, not taking too much  meeting  time, and then in addition, add to it the third level of the  balance,  uh, um this - this issue of not being too intrusive,	no
22484	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
22485	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	asking in a way that they don't mind.	no
22486	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	If we  release  this corpus, what do we want, I mean	no
22487	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	if you do this free form um  the free form solution where some questions are very open-ended	no
22488	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	then you need - someone needs to enter that, and they'll be notes and it will be very difficult for somebody later actually use	no
22489	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, I think rea- I think that	no
22490	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	that without mapping it. It's O_K. But it's -	no
22491	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	we need to  remember  that we have -	no
22492	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	First  of all, it's  not  all  free  form. We have several  categories that  are   specifically  constrained,	no
22493	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
22494	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And in terms of the  more open ones, we have the - we're in the enviable position of having the  contact  information and also  knowing  most of the people who	no
22495	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	will be participating in the meeting data. We can	no
22496	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	find it - We can  resolve  certain issues later, if -	no
22497	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mmm.	no
22498	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I mean, I guess what you  really  want, is if	no
22499	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah, and the question is how	no
22500	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	extensive this gets.	no
22501	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	there's  some  information you wanna know - So we want some rough idea of their dialect, basically.	no
22502	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
22503	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	That's  it.	no
22504	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	then we should have some question where it's not free form, except for these people who are	no
22505	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	who have	no
22506	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"non-American English accents. There we probably have to have a category ""Non-American English"" and then a few choices."	no
22507	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And we should have something	no
22508	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	that's simple, that people can circle,	no
22509	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	like	no
22510	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	these TIMIT regions or something, so that we have something	no
22511	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	that minimally you can - cuz a lot of times if you give the data out that's what people are gonna use. They're gonna want some small set of	no
22512	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	places, and then, but anything additional people can fill out, and we can put it in as a note or something, but if we don't have that, someone's gotta sit there and figure out	no
22513	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	you know, I've got twenty people who said	no
22514	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Midwest, and I've got a few people who said something else and these don't overlap or these	no
22515	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well-	no
22516	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Isn't it - I mean, I think  that	no
22517	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	we're going a  little  bit in a  circle,	no
22518	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	because I  like  the TIMIT suggestion very much,	no
22519	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and I think it's a question of how to ge- incorporate it,	no
22520	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and - and we've already suggested - I mean,	no
22521	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	it's come up in this discussion, that - the suggestion	no
22522	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	that	no
22523	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	we could have  um the TIMIT categories for the American,	no
22524	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and - and then make the choice  or not,	no
22525	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Oh, O_K, so - yeah as long as you have -	no
22526	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	as to whether we do it for British,	no
22527	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I mean, w- we sort of discussed one way or the other, and it	no
22528	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	doesn't  matter to  me.	no
22529	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I don't know if  Adam has - has a preference,	no
22530	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	But - but -	no
22531	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	but we could have  you know, a sub- a sub-categorization for American,	no
22532	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	We could even use the TIMIT subcategorization. I don't know if it has one for British, or whatever,	no
22533	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
22534	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	But you know, just have it - you know, a short simple form that you can categorize yourself	no
22535	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	in a - in a systematic way.	no
22536	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	What about	no
22537	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	the - the phrasing that	no
22538	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	um	no
22539	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Chuck used, uh  which was	no
22540	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	in - in relation to the question I was trying to	no
22541	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	formulate of uh	no
22542	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Where -	no
22543	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	where did you - what - what was that - what w- how did you phrase it?	no
22544	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	What language was spoken in the home?	no
22545	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"""What language was spok-"", yeah, so it's not where did you grow up, but what language was spoken in the home between the ages of, what would it be, five and twelve or something like that?"	no
22546	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mmm. Yeah.	no
22547	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	It's a good idea.	no
22548	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Depends of who you  ask,  what the age range is.	no
22549	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, in the  home,  the influence of the  home  is much lower age than that, I mean once you go beyond the age five or six	no
22550	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
22551	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	then it's the -	no
22552	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	the school influence as well and	no
22553	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And the peers.	no
22554	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and yeah, so  In the home it's sort of your phonetic first level,	no
22555	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	That's  one  part though.	no
22556	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	um   a -	no
22557	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah, so this is why I -	no
22558	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So it's - you know it starts to get sort of complicated.	no
22559	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, -	no
22560	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So - so th-	no
22561	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	It's - that's  not  a  problem  though, I mean.	no
22562	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	That would be a  good   question  to ask, and then you could add a question. You know,	no
22563	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	would - uh	no
22564	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"""among your peers""."	no
22565	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	You know.	no
22566	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	cuz he does make a good point about the region not necessarily again, if you're on the army base or -	no
22567	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Specify the  age  range.	no
22568	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right.	no
22569	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, the way it's phrased right now,	no
22570	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
22571	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	it's clearly asking about language.	no
22572	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And so, what it's trying to get at is what you think you  speak.  Now, I think that	no
22573	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right.	no
22574	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	the point is well  taken  that sometimes people are  wrong  about what they think they speak.	no
22575	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	But, other than having a trained  linguist	no
22576	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	interview them  and ask these very specific  questions,  I don't see a way  around  it.	no
22577	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
22578	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"Because as you  said,  what you're gonna have to stay - say is ""Well, list the languages that your  parents  spoke when you were in home and how  good  they were at it and how long they spoke it,"	no
22579	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"and  now  list the ones in  preschool  and now  list  the ones in  first  grade and now list the ones your  friends  speak -"""	no
22580	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Sort of like as soon as you get to the  cases on the edge, the complexity just shoots up.	no
22581	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right.	no
22582	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah, that's right.	no
22583	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
22584	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
22585	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So I want to  try  to keep the complexity so someone can fill out this  form	no
22586	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and we're -	no
22587	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	at the  beginning  of a  meeting  without taking f- uh forty-five minutes.	no
22588	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and then we - like I said, we have the enviable benefit of  knowing  most of these people.	no
22589	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and being able to ask them  follow-ups  if we need to.	no
22590	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	For now, right so it's - I mean, again, we are hoping to expand this out, yeah.	no
22591	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	For now.	no
22592	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	That's  true.	no
22593	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Washington and stuff,	no
22594	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	yeah.	no
22595	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	That's  true.	no
22596	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So I think that adding the - the  TIMIT	no
22597	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	categories  is a good idea, because that's very easy for a person to fill out.	no
22598	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	But I think we  still  have this problem of	no
22599	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	is it gonna be a  self-evaluation?	no
22600	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	or are we gonna ask them	no
22601	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"""what was it when you were  four  years old, or what was it when you were  six  years old, or what wher-"" w-"	no
22602	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	What's the best way of phrasing the question?	no
22603	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, you know the  other  thing,  too,  is that	no
22604	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	it seems like th- one of the reasons you would gather	no
22605	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	real detailed information about their	no
22606	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	native  language  is if you were gonna do fine-grained phonetic  analysis  or something.	no
22607	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and -	no
22608	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, it's -	no
22609	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And somebody  might.	no
22610	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I don't -	no
22611	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Or adapta- or adaptation.	no
22612	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Most of -	no
22613	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well that's what I was gonna ask, is that -	no
22614	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	but most of those people don't rely on the self-evaluations, anyway. They'll probably listen to the speech, so	no
22615	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, I - you know, I w-	no
22616	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I  was thinking of it as -	no
22617	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	e-	no
22618	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	that's a good point,	no
22619	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	but I was thinking uh, you know, with reference to	no
22620	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	the  language model issue, which	no
22621	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	uh	no
22622	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and I  guess  it could be done  inductively,	no
22623	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	but if you have a bunch of, say, R_less dialects and	no
22624	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	uh you know, if they -	no
22625	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	But even you know in Switchboard, I -	no
22626	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I remember looking  really  carefully at -	no
22627	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	They  have information sort of like TIMIT I don't know it's - how well they categorized,	no
22628	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	but they had North Atlantic, Mid-Atlantic, and -	no
22629	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	You know,  Texas  was definitely out on -	no
22630	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I mean	no
22631	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	most of the people from cer- certain places in the South were	no
22632	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	from	no
22633	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	specific Texas locations, but	no
22634	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	other than that	no
22635	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	you had a huge range of -	no
22636	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	You know, people would say Boston, and they had nothing like what I would call a Boston accent. So it was -	no
22637	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm. Interesting.	no
22638	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Were they putting down where they lived	no
22639	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	at the moment they m- recordings were made? Is that why?	no
22640	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Um	no
22641	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Rather than where they grew up?	no
22642	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	No, the question was really	no
22643	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	geared  towards trying to get people's self-evaluation of their	no
22644	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
22645	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	dialect	no
22646	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mmm.	no
22647	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	region.	no
22648	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	But you have a lot of  stratification  in -	no
22649	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and you know, for instance, you know, Minnesota Midwest is totally different than Michigan Midwest which is totally -  these were all settled by very different  type people, so	no
22650	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
22651	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	any  region.	no
22652	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right.	no
22653	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Interesting.	no
22654	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	it - it's sort of a general help	no
22655	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	but I think that anyone who's doing phonetics wouldn't rely on that, they would probably use it as a first pass or something,	no
22656	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So, then we probably don't  need  the fine-grained information.	no
22657	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well maybe should we just -	no
22658	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Then maybe we shouldn't - just shouldn't  ask.	no
22659	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, I think we  do  need to make sure about the f- the non-native accents because those are, you know -	no
22660	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
22661	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	but we don't need to ha- be really really specific about the others, because it won't be very w- helpful anyway.	no
22662	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
22663	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, maybe for the native  English  speakers we shouldn't even  ask  the region if it's that  unreliable.	no
22664	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I think we  should,  because other databases do.	no
22665	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	It's sort of a political thing.	no
22666	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And there are some general - like, you will find more New Yorkers in the New York category.	no
22667	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	but it's not	no
22668	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	It  can't  be relied on  only.	no
22669	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right.	no
22670	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	The other thing also is that I'm asking for the variety of English, and I  did  just put American, British, Indian and other.	no
22671	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So, I didn't put Canadian, Australian, and all the other varieties.	no
22672	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
22673	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	But Other is there, and people will fill that out. They'll see by example.  Yeah that's - I think that's fine, they'll say oh, I'm not one of these, I'm	no
22674	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	e-	no
22675	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	But do you think those three are O_K?	no
22676	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah, I think those are good.	no
22677	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K.	no
22678	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Canadian, or	no
22679	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
22680	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So internally, we have Texas and other.	no
22681	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Hmm.	no
22682	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So that for the Eng- native English speakers, we'll do variety of English,	no
22683	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right.	no
22684	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	regions from the TIMIT labels, and another field.	no
22685	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I mean, even like Cal- L_A is totally different than - I mean, you really can't um -	no
22686	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And then	no
22687	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well -	no
22688	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
22689	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	We could ask them for more information, but I don't think it's -	no
22690	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I  thought  this was  be fast.	no
22691	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well that's what	no
22692	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
22693	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	necessary and it's not going to solve this problem.	no
22694	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	the  final - the fin- the  third  category was designed to do,	no
22695	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	because - I mean, you have a bunch of different types of accents in  New  York	no
22696	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	You know. Native-speaking  New  Yorkers, as a - as a function of their  social  uh groups and their  ethnic  identifications and their -	no
22697	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Oh yeah.	no
22698	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	mm-hmm	no
22699	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	You know. There are  lots  of things that are	no
22700	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	very  identifiable as	no
22701	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	um	no
22702	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	you know,	no
22703	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	other - other aspects,	no
22704	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
22705	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	which is why we have this third category. So	no
22706	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	we wanted to	no
22707	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	certainly distinguish American versus British,	no
22708	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and other types at that level,	no
22709	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and then allow people to self-identify if there are  other  specific things,	no
22710	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and then in  addition,  this issue of  regions	no
22711	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	with   some  sort of	no
22712	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	time  frame for the re- region because I think that if you live	no
22713	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	in Massachusetts now versus	no
22714	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	you know, in childhood and as-  adolescence  -	no
22715	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So if you lis-	no
22716	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	if - if you - You know. So,  region  with respect to a  time  frame is what I would suggest.	no
22717	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Air conditioning.	no
22718	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"""Where did you live?"" I mean. What  you  said."	no
22719	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	you know,	no
22720	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"""where - where - wh- where did you live?"", or"	no
22721	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"uh, what you were saying, ""Languages in the home""."	no
22722	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	But I think that	no
22723	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	uh a time frame on the region would be useful instead of	no
22724	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"""Region  now "", say."	no
22725	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	It's a little bit  unbounded.	no
22726	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	um	no
22727	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	so  are  you suggesting that you put something in about childhood	no
22728	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	in there.	no
22729	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	well, you know, there's this issue of -	no
22730	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	of what age is  relevant  for the formation of your speech patterns, whatever they are.	no
22731	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well you could distinguish between pre-five and five t- five to twelve, right? So depending on what someone's interest was in the formation of the phonetic kinds of  categories or whether - or whether you're talking more about their	no
22732	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And -	no
22733	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	linguistic speech patterns, you know	no
22734	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Oh,  that's  interesting.	no
22735	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	uh	no
22736	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	so	no
22737	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	But, again,	no
22738	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	it depends how fine we wanna get, but we could say uh	no
22739	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"""where did you live before you were five?"", ""where did you live after you were five?"",  I  don't know."	no
22740	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Oh that's  interesting.	no
22741	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	from five to -	no
22742	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	yeah	no
22743	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	fifteen or something,	no
22744	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	is a -	no
22745	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I mean, I think the question on regions is really	no
22746	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	to ask people	no
22747	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	how did they define their dialect region now, di- the- whether they picked it up	no
22748	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	at - the - one age or another.	no
22749	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	pretty much, I mean, most people will  know  whether they have a southern	no
22750	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	accent or not.	no
22751	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
22752	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	um, but they may  have lived	no
22753	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	you know, in other places, too. So if we ask the question about dialect regions, it makes  no  sense to say where do you live now.	no
22754	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right.	no
22755	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right?	no
22756	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right.	no
22757	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	You ask how would you best define your	no
22758	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	your accent or your dialect style.	no
22759	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"Right, the way - the way the form reads  now,  I think it's pretty  clear  that's what we're asking  cuz it says ""Native English speakers, Variety of English, American, British, Indian, Other, Region""."	no
22760	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K	no
22761	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
22762	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And then we'll have  Southern  English, you know, whatever -	no
22763	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	whatever the TIMIT categories are. So I think	no
22764	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	i- if you  look at this fr-	no
22765	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Or you could say to somebody,  how  do you define your - your - the accent	no
22766	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	that you have.	no
22767	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right.	no
22768	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	um	no
22769	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And then you can ask these other questions as well, but what we don't want them to think is that they're living in a certain place	no
22770	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and that therefore they're - I mean, nowadays  hardly  anybody	no
22771	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right.	no
22772	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	from California  has a  native Californian accent, so.	no
22773	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
22774	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well I - I g-	no
22775	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K.	no
22776	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I don't think it was  ever  the intent to  talk about the region  now,  because	no
22777	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right, so I - it seems to me that  if you read this form,	no
22778	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K, as long as it's clear.	no
22779	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	It's -	no
22780	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	It's a sub-categorization.	no
22781	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	i- w- it's pretty obvious that it's a subcategory of the  language	no
22782	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
22783	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	that you think you speak,   not  where you  live.  I mean, I don't say  anything  about where you live	no
22784	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
22785	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K.	no
22786	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K.	no
22787	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	on the  form.	no
22788	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So it's just in the  section  talking about language.	no
22789	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K.	no
22790	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K.	no
22791	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Why don't we try it out.	no
22792	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and see -  see what kind of responses we get from people. Anyway.	no
22793	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
22794	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah,	no
22795	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"And then uh, as Jane said, the last question is ""List other language influences, bilingual dialects, et cetera."" And that's just and open-ended"	no
22796	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Oh. Mm-hmm.	no
22797	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	place for them to  do.	no
22798	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Sounds good.	no
22799	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	That's  to handle that  unusual  percent	no
22800	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And then -	no
22801	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	or two. Yeah.	no
22802	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And then the  bottom  of the form is for -	no
22803	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	not  for  them  to fill out, but for  us  to fill out,	no
22804	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	for um	no
22805	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	the aliases and database - speaker database that the person is in,	no
22806	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	since we'll eventually anonymize and this will be a form- a place for us to	no
22807	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	connect the two. And then the meetings that they attended,	no
22808	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
22809	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	because there'll be one form for each person.	no
22810	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Sounds good.	no
22811	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	It's  very  efficient.	no
22812	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K. So.	no
22813	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah, I guess I'll fiddle around  yet  again with the language stuff.	no
22814	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I  don't think you really have to do all that much.	no
22815	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	d- I- yeah.	no
22816	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, you -	no
22817	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	It - it gets into a can of worms.	no
22818	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
22819	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
22820	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I mean, the more you ask, the more you realize that	no
22821	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	you're not getting  great  answers to what you're  asking  and -	no
22822	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	N- Right.	no
22823	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
22824	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, y- you didn't really  talk  about the  non-English  speaker categories.	no
22825	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So.	no
22826	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right.	no
22827	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So, there's another area which is non-native English speakers which asks for Native language,	no
22828	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Region, and Variety of English.	no
22829	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And that's it.	no
22830	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	N- detec-	no
22831	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Because it used to be that Germans would learn  British  English, and now I think there's, you know, is a certain percentage of them who -	no
22832	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	What about proficiency in English? as well?	no
22833	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	who've	no
22834	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	@@	no
22835	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	to tend toward American English.	no
22836	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Proficiency.  That's a good idea.	no
22837	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Uh,	no
22838	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	That's hard though, for self-identification -	no
22839	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I -	no
22840	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I -	no
22841	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	You don't want to do it for political reasons, I mean - I'm no-	no
22842	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Hmm.	no
22843	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"I wasn't thinking about that, I was just thinking, ""Gee, I'd"	no
22844	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I wasn't thinking -	no
22845	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"like to know actually -"""	no
22846	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	oh	no
22847	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	No, no. I wasn't thinking political at  all.  I was just saying, looking at	no
22848	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Oh, O_K.	no
22849	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	applications of people over the years for post-docs here. They're r-	no
22850	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	generally not very good at assessing their own abilities.	no
22851	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, do you think that's -	no
22852	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K.	no
22853	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	but -	no
22854	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I agree.	no
22855	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	That's also because they know that	no
22856	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	it's a re-	no
22857	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	important  for them to be good at it. So, don't -	no
22858	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	That could be.	no
22859	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	don't you think they overrate	no
22860	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	rather than underrate?	no
22861	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	That could be.	no
22862	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yes.	no
22863	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, so maybe that's -	no
22864	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So, but no, I think proficiency is actually a good thing to  have  on this sort of form.	no
22865	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Maybe we - maybe we shouldn't  ask  it, I don't know.	no
22866	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	The - the question are -	no
22867	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well,  e-	no
22868	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	what are - what would the categories be?	no
22869	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"I'd - I'd have to - I - I'd wanna relate it back to  training.  ""How many years did you  study  English"", or,"	no
22870	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Good, Bad.	no
22871	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"you know, ""have you lived in the America - in a c- an English"	no
22872	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"country before"". But it seems like that's  so  -"	no
22873	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I mean, I think that	no
22874	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	you know, if a person who -	no
22875	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"What about something like ""How comfortable are you"	no
22876	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"in a meeting conducted in English?"", or ""How easy is it for you?"", or something like that where it's -"	no

22881	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
22882	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah, that's a good one.	no
22883	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	That'd be O_K.	no
22884	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
22885	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Something - wha- what do  you  think, what's it - I mean -	no
22886	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Is better.	no
22887	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	How - yeah? How long have you been in an English speaking country. O_K.	no
22888	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I think it's better.	no
22889	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	@@	no
22890	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
22891	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah, I  like  that.	no
22892	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I   like  that.	no
22893	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	That's - that's non-threatening,	no
22894	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and it's also an i-	no
22895	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah	no
22896	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	a good indicator. And there are people who  haven't  ever  lived in an English speaking country and who are  superb.  However,	no
22897	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	um,	no
22898	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mmm.	no
22899	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	that's -	no
22900	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	you know	no
22901	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And then there will be people who  live in an English speaking  country,  but all their meetings are held in another  language.	no
22902	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I do think it's a pretty good indicator.	no
22903	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	That's true too.	no
22904	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Or even,	no
22905	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
22906	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So,	no
22907	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	you know, I mean,	no
22908	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	some people who just don't  change  much in their -	no

22910	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
22911	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yochai's company is like that.	no
22912	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Being totally monolingual, I'm not the right person to ask,	no
22913	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Everybody speaks Hebrew.	no
22914	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Really?	no
22915	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	to talk about this but it just seems to me that that doesn't -	no
22916	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	the length of time doesn't really get at what we're asking.	no
22917	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right? It seems to be that  asking  about the  proficiency,  even if it's self-rated,	no
22918	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	is  what we wanna know.	no
22919	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Except  that you have some many  biasing  factors, you have - you have people who are highly confident when they really  should be a little bit less confident, and then you have,	no
22920	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
22921	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	uh	no
22922	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	other people who are just the reverse, and - and it - so many things that vary - I -	no
22923	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yes.	no
22924	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And also we wanna keep it simple and non-evaluative.	no
22925	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
22926	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K.	no
22927	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	We done?	no
22928	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	With  that  form.	no
22929	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah. Oh, there's  another  form.	no
22930	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Shall we wait for other forms later, or you -	no
22931	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	No, you got - what's the other form?	no
22932	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Keep going more  form  -	no
22933	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Uh, the other form is a modified  digits  form.	no
22934	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	uh	no
22935	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and  it's pretty sim- this one's pretty simple, it's - it's very much what like the digits forms in front of us, except it doesn't ha- ask for sex or native language.	no
22936	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Um, so it's Name, Email, Time, Date, Seat, Session,	no
22937	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mike number, Channel, Mike type.	no
22938	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Why do we need  that  much information, why do we need the  email  address, for example?	no
22939	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Uh, in case people have the same name.	no
22940	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Oh, I see.	no
22941	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	How often would that happen?	no
22942	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	In case people what?	no
22943	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So I wanted -	no
22944	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Have the same name.	no
22945	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Oh.	no
22946	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah, I'm particularly sensitive to this cuz a good friend of mine in S- in Seattle was named Scott Smith and there were fourteen of them in -	no
22947	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	at Boeing.	no
22948	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I see.	no
22949	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So	no
22950	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So the only -	no
22951	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	so -	no
22952	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	We could  drop  email. I mean that's not a big deal, it's just uh -	no
22953	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, it's an - it's an interesting  identifier,  I -	no
22954	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I - now that I realize the und- the reason for it.	no
22955	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well the other thing is that potentially if this is done over a period of time, someone's email could change.	no
22956	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	The -	no
22957	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right.	no
22958	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	That's true too.	no
22959	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, the other way I was thinking about it was assigning them an I_D	no
22960	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
22961	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	but I  hate  it when people do that to me, when they say, here's you I_D, don't forget it.	no
22962	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Oh yeah,  that's  bad.  Thanks	no
22963	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So, I - I wanted just  something  that would give us a  hint  of	no
22964	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	who the person is if the name field isn't readable or it's a duplicate.	no
22965	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	That's interesting.	no
22966	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	How about their birthday?  I don't know.	no
22967	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Good idea.	no
22968	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I mean, not - not the year  not the year  not the year but just their birthday.	no
22969	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	It's the age question again.	no
22970	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Your mother's maiden name -	no
22971	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Oh, I see. Then, you don't hafta ask the  age.	no
22972	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
22973	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Not the year.	no
22974	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	mother's maiden name	no
22975	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I don't know, what are the chances of people having the same name.	no
22976	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	social security number,	no
22977	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah, that's right. And a  bank  where you frequent.	no
22978	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
22979	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	PIN.	no
22980	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	They  -	no
22981	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	The PIN!	no
22982	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Social - social  security  number.	no
22983	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So, although the email - email will change, I think that's a good way of doing it. We'll be able to backtrack from email.	no
22984	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
22985	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I   like  that.	no
22986	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I never thought of that as an identifier.	no
22987	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	That makes sense.	no
22988	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Um, and then the other thing I was  thinking  about	no
22989	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and it probably wouldn't be on the  digits  form, but it - it is something that	no
22990	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	some  form  about  the individual meeting.	no
22991	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
22992	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Now, the problem I  have  with that is I don't know who would be filling it out.	no
22993	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well,  that  I think, someone internal to the meeting could do after the fact.	no
22994	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And this would - and - and we discussed this, this is with reference to like the D_T_D,	no
22995	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	what you would put in the D_T_D that's meeting-specific. So. And it could be something like,	no
22996	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"""oh by the way,"	no
22997	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	the guy giving the presentation today	no
22998	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	is the  student  of the professor who	no
22999	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"you know, whatever""."	no
23000	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So, speaker A is his professor and they - and he's preparing for his quals or some such thing like that.	no
23001	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"Or it could be you know, ""so-and-so and so-and-so are married""."	no
23002	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Hmm.	no
23003	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So-and-so and so -	no
23004	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Just to pick up an arbitrary an  example.	no
23005	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	We - this wouldn't be relevant all the time but you know, if there's a big discussion on	no
23006	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	you know, the - the - um, best way to move house,	no
23007	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	then - and these people are talking a whole lot,	no
23008	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	then it might be interesting information to say oh by the way they're married, or -	no
23009	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I - I don't mean, uh, you know.	no
23010	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right.	no
23011	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So th- so the sorts of questions  I  had were one	no
23012	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Who's gonna fill it out, and who's gonna take  responsibility  for filling it out	no
23013	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	in each meeting, I mean, will we re- will we  require  it.	no
23014	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I would tend to leave that	no
23015	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	e- spontaneous, I think that	no
23016	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
23017	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	e- at the stage of uh	no
23018	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Uh, sc- scanning the	no
23019	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	transcripts after they've been produced by -	no
23020	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	by our -	no
23021	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	by I_B_M,	no
23022	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
23023	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	At  that  point, I think that some of these dynamics will appear to be important, and you could - you could spend a  lot  of time enumerating all the different relationships that people have.	no
23024	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And that was my other question, which is  um	no
23025	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
23026	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	what  sort of information do we want to  record?  I mean, so I think  pairwise  relationships are pretty  easy.	no
23027	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
23028	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	You know, source, destination, relation.	no
23029	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Are there  other  sorts of things that might - we might want to record?	no
23030	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, I ju- I was just thinking, with reference to	no
23031	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	uh, things that have - that bear on the content or the status relations,	no
23032	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	would be the things -	no
23033	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Without  being  exhaustive,  by any means,	no
23034	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	but just like I said, if there's a k- a certain topic that comes up in the meeting, and -	no
23035	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	that knowing their relationship will clarify it,	no
23036	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	or  if there's a certain dynamic that comes up -	no
23037	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So, I mean, a person	no
23038	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	is asked a whole bunch of questions, more than you'd usually think they'd be asked, and it turns out it's because he's being prepared for a job interview or something like that,	no
23039	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right.	no
23040	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	then it's useful to know that - that relationship.	no
23041	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I think that fits in well with the whole meeting map -	no
23042	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	But, not to be exhaustive.	no
23043	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	mapping meetings concept is that's another way of  looking  at -	no
23044	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Interesting.	no
23045	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	looking  at it. So,	no
23046	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	are there anything other than pairwise?	no
23047	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Oh, well  yeah,  you could have people who are all part of the same  football  league, or -	no
23048	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Oh yeah, O_K.	no
23049	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	uh	no
23050	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So thi-	no
23051	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	or  chess  club, or -	no
23052	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Isn't this an open-ended,	no
23053	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	like	no
23054	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	basically a notes column? I mean you can imagine wanting	no
23055	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	you  should  be able  always  to attach some	no
23056	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yes,  shirt   - certainly.	no
23057	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	notes to - is this the - the place where we would do that, or is there another	no
23058	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I've been thi- I - it seems to be that there  is  -	no
23059	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	place.	no
23060	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	We could attach more structure if we wanted to. Especially because a  lot  of these relationships are pairwise power relationships.	no
23061	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I- Maybe I was missing something maybe, but	no
23062	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I mean	no
23063	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	this is something one would try to  infer,  but how do - how would you	no
23064	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	How would you freeze that information about what, uh, I mean, we already have these things about someone's a professor and someone's a student, or something, but	no
23065	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
23066	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	would you - would you -	no
23067	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Some person would be writing O_K this person was leading the meeting and that was or - or - is that what you mean, or -	no
23068	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	What - what - what - uh,	no
23069	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"Um, just as an  example,  it would be, ""Source, Adam Janin"", ""Destination, Morgan"", ""Relationship, Advisor""."	no
23070	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Oh, so you're just putting	no
23071	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	preexisting	no
23072	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	relationships that are	no
23073	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	that are relevant.	no
23074	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I think that starts to -	no
23075	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I see.	no
23076	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	There's definitely some clear cases,	no
23077	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	but there are a lot of gray areas, where	no
23078	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	yeah.	no
23079	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yep.	no
23080	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	the context	no
23081	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	happens	no
23082	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	just in that meeting, or, I mean, where you don't wanna sort of	no
23083	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah, I m-	no
23084	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	have to	no
23085	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	make a distinction between a pre-existing	no
23086	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	relationship, or	no
23087	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, realize, w- this was -	no
23088	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	the idea  was  that this would be meeting specific.	no
23089	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Otherwise, they would -	no
23090	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	it would be possible to have a	no
23091	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	But I mean, there are some that generalize	no
23092	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	higher level thing.	no
23093	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right, but that example was not -	no
23094	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	over many meetings and there are some that don't, and there are some	no
23095	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	That's  true.	no
23096	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right, so my example was not a good one,	no
23097	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	That's  true.	no
23098	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	things that happen in between meetings,	no
23099	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
23100	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	because that's -	no
23101	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So, I mean, for -	no
23102	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and -	no
23103	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	today,  for instance, this is the second meeting recorded today.	no
23104	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	The first meeting was a - was a front-end meeting, and in that one, the basic form of that was uh, I was the leader,	no
23105	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"and I was saying uh, ""what are the results you've gotten in the last week?"""	no
23106	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And they were - and uh one person was sort of taking the lead,	no
23107	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	in describing what the results were,	no
23108	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"and then uh, Chuck was taking the role of saying, ""well, what did you mean by that?"", so he was sort of like the out- s- semi-outsider, asking curiosity questions."	no
23109	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"And then it would come back to me with saying ""well, you know, you showed me  that  but you know, I think you should do  this  in the future,"""	no
23110	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	so it was very much sort of	no
23111	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"""Leader"" and - and - and - and ""Led"" sort of relationship."	no
23112	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And um	no
23113	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	the guy I was primarily doing this with uh is - is a visiting researcher,	no
23114	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	uh, in this l- meeting,	no
23115	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	uh, you are my graduate student,	no
23116	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	but uh it's not taking that kind of role at all,	no
23117	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right.	no
23118	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	right? You're - you're - you're actually leading the meeting for the most part,  most  of this meeting, so it's -	no
23119	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, it's just cuz it's my turn.	no
23120	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah, well, whatever.	no
23121	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So	no
23122	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Uh	no
23123	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah, so I - I don't know, so you're suggesting -	no
23124	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I think this one needs to be open-ended,  completely  open-ended, and	no
23125	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	the only concern  I  would have is if there's something we  wanna  be able to say and we can't put it in that field.	no
23126	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, the- there's -	no
23127	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	@@	no
23128	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I mean.	no
23129	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I - g- you -	no
23130	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	You're  the expert on the D_T_Ds,	no
23131	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, the D_T_Ds mean we can	no
23132	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	but -	no
23133	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	do whatever -	no
23134	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
23135	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	however we want it.	no
23136	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	But what I - what I was thinking uh -	no
23137	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	the reason that I  didn't  want to make it  completely  open-ended is that it  does  seems like there  is  some  structure  which is common.	no
23138	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Especially with these  pairwise  ones, where you can describe them and pairwise. And you might want a  tool	no
23139	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So you mean like -	no
23140	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	that  used  that information.	no
23141	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Is there a way that we can add keywords or sub-	no
23142	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I don't know what you would call them, but little labels	no
23143	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	for things that we decide are useful things to have	no
23144	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Sure, absolutely.	no
23145	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	but	no
23146	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	You know, as long as we have this one	no
23147	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	place where it can all be stored, then we're fine, I think.	no
23148	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right, cuz it seems like it's sort of a -	no
23149	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and those'll probably occur - I mean, to us, we'll think of a few of them, some other researcher will think of	no
23150	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right.	no
23151	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	some totally different	no
23152	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"Exactly. It's sort of a research question, you - you're analyzing the meeting and you're deciding, ""ah, there's this kind of structure to it."""	no

23154	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Y- Yeah, it's - it's -	no
23155	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	it's gonna change -	no
23156	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	It's gonna change, and maybe we wanna regroup things under different labels later, if we figure out that these pairwise things are -	no
23157	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
23158	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
23159	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Interesting.	no
23160	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right	no
23161	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well I think -	no
23162	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well -	no
23163	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	being - being in a common organization was one I hadn't thought of, that -	no
23164	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So you're  football  league was a good one.	no
23165	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So the  ones   I've  been thinking of are all sort of	no
23166	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	uh, power, responsibility.	no
23167	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I guess husband-wife is yet another one.	no
23168	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And so, you know, in discourse	no
23169	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	analysis you get things like	no

23196	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	generally useful and it - it sounds like a good thing to do.	no
23197	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And -	no
23198	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K.	no
23199	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Interesting.   Good.	no
23200	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And  systematize  also maybe the  encoding  of it if - as we find some are useful and some are not so useful.	no
23201	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Nope.	no
23202	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah, so what I have right now is all pairwise, so that's probably not sufficient.	no
23203	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
23204	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I think you don't need to have that much structure built in, and that would	no
23205	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah, maybe not.	no
23206	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	be less time-consuming to do it this way first, and then find out what structure's needed.	no
23207	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yep.	no
23208	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K.	no
23209	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	what about all of the meetings that have been recorded so far that - without this?	no
23210	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Will -	no
23211	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Will somebody go back and fill that  in,  or we just won't  have  it, or -	no
23212	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, I  think  that in a  lot  of the meetings people  won't  be filling this out  anyway.	no
23213	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So  really  what I want to have is a  place  that if a researcher  wants  that information, they can  add  it.	no
23214	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mmm.	no
23215	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Almost all of the meetings	no
23216	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	that we have	no
23217	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	are recorded with roughly  this  group  uh and uh  you know and	no
23218	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right.	no
23219	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	a fair minority with the group that we have in the  morning,  so this is  not  a lot of people. We could easily - There's just a couple other meetings that	no
23220	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right.	no
23221	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So it -	no
23222	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So it wouldn't be that hard to go back and -	no
23223	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	We can regenerate a  lot  of this information.	no
23224	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
23225	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
23226	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	But -	no
23227	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Even  if we  can't,	no
23228	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	generate it, I think it's alright to have some of the sections in your	no
23229	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	database blank,	no
23230	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
23231	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	that this information was  not  collected for this meeting.	no
23232	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And there's just not gonna be a way  around  that.	no
23233	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	That's just gonna  happen	no
23234	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	like the N_S_ A  meeting,	no
23235	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	the	no
23236	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	networks  meeting.	no
23237	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I don't think they're gonna want to fill  out  that information.	no
23238	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
23239	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So.	no
23240	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K, enough on forms.	no
23241	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K, so we're running kind of late, so we'll probably wanna zip through some other things, maybe	yes
23242	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K, so we're running kind of late, so we'll probably wanna zip through some other things, maybe	no
23243	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K.	no
23244	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	do some more time on - on Jose's stuff later, um  uh Status of Transcription,	no
23245	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Uh, I guess, you know, we - we recently woke up um our friends and uh	no
23246	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	so I - I guess - you've sent off this - the uh	no
23247	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	C_D-ROMs  and you got some response from -	no
23248	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	from uh I_B_M about -	no
23249	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	They haven't  received  them yet,	no
23250	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	but I  did  get a  response  from them saying	no
23251	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	"""Yes we're still alive, we haven't done anything yet."" basically."	no
23252	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
23253	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And uh -	no
23254	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Was there some suggestion that they might soon, or -	no
23255	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah. So - so, they've	no
23256	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
23257	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	transferred the responsibility to someone else. I  can't remember his name	no
23258	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	McCoond	no
23259	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	McCoond ?	no
23260	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
23261	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Something  like that, but uh -	no
23262	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And so he sent me email and said he's gonna be starting to work on it, and I haven't received anything else.	no
23263	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Great, O_K. Well, that was that one.	no
23264	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So.	no
23265	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
23266	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Um,	no
23267	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So  tomorrow  I'll send a email and just ask if he received it, he  should  be getting it today.	no
23268	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Actually he should have  gotten   it  yesterday.  But.	no
23269	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Give him a day.	no
23270	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	um, and I think we should just sort of look at this thing from you, off-line Jose cuz it's getting kind of late but I mean I think the bottom line just glancing through it is that there's - there's a  lot  of overlap,	no
23271	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
23272	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	in just  energy  related things and so you need something  else.	no
23273	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
23274	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I mean, that's sort of -  right?	no
23275	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K.	no
23276	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And uh what - the - so I'd -	no
23277	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	What about that error that -	no
23278	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	that uh  the -	no
23279	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	The residual error?	no
23280	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	the supposed lub- no, the supposed  bug   that was -	no
23281	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	that we were - We were guessing you had a bug before because  you went through and you concatenated all of these things together -	no
23282	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
23283	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Ah, yeah yeah. I - I found the error,	no
23284	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and I repeated the experiments eh and here, eh  you can find the new results	no
23285	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	eh  with - Yeah, yeah.	no
23286	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Ah.	no
23287	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K, so this is post bug fix.  Good, O_K.	no
23288	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K?	no
23289	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So um - so I had two thought just glancing through this. So, one is - one is that um	no
23290	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	that uh	no
23291	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	we might wanna talk about normalization.	no
23292	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I mean, I don't know what normalizations you use. Sometimes things have more overlap before you've done	no
23293	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	some kind of normalization  and we might think about what different kinds of normalizations are possible.	no
23294	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
23295	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And the other thing is that, if that  isn't   @@  uh so much of the issue, then probably -	no
23296	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
23297	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I mean, residual L_P_C energy and just plain energy are very closely  related,  even though they're  different  and um so	no
23298	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
23299	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	um  you really  may  need to go to something that looks at i- in  some  sense harmonicity, or um	no
23300	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	um	no
23301	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Hmm.	no
23302	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	relationship to or - fit - fit to pitch tracks on uh - on either side of - of it, for instance?	no
23303	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
23304	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	You know, so if - if there's uh a really bad fit between	no
23305	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	where the pitch is going in this suppose - uh hypothesized region of overlap,	no
23306	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and the - the - and one or the other uh side,	no
23307	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Another  side.	no
23308	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	you know, then this - this - this might	no
23309	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	an alteration in th- in the tracking way.	no
23310	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	uh, suggest a -	no
23311	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Excuse me?	no
23312	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	You mean that eh you ehm  mmm -	no
23313	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I understand that eh you - you mean eh to - to study the alteration	no
23314	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	between the - the tracking of the pitch eh if we compare the overlapping zone with a speaker zone.	no
23315	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I- if you have two - if you have two - if you have  uh	no
23316	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	in the co- in the  context.	no
23317	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	two	no
23318	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	people speaking	no
23319	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
23320	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	uh  and	no
23321	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	there's an overlap, then - I mean the first thing is that there should be a mixture of harmonics	no
23322	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
23323	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	uh during overlapped voice sections anyway.	no
23324	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And um	no
23325	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	the - any - a measure that you have of how much of the energy is due to your best guess at a particular harmonic sequence,	no
23326	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	it's also going to be a smaller  fraction.  This is, you know, related to the harmonicity sort of thing.	no
23327	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Uh-huh.	no
23328	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And then the other thing I'm saying is that if you look at the  temporal  evolution  of the pitch	no
23329	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
23330	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	there  should  be  something  like a discontinuity there.	no
23331	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
23332	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Now, there's  other  places where you'll have discontinuities in pitch and speech, but -	no
23333	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	but - maybe it'll have something to - have a different character.	no
23334	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	But it seems like energy - energy tells you something, but uh	no
23335	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	if - unless this is a normalization problem, it looks from your results like there's so much overlap that  certainly you need something that  isn't  energy-like, in  addition  to it, at least.	no
23336	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Uh-huh.	no
23337	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K.	no
23338	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Are -	no
23339	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Are the things in the -	no
23340	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I don't normalicized eh in these er- experiments.	no
23341	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	by the moment. I don't normalicize.	no
23342	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K, so the question is - is - would some kind of normalization  help.	no
23343	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah?	no
23344	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	You know, uh, i- i- it could be that if you normalized uh by the overall	no
23345	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Nnn. Yeah.	no
23346	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	um  energy uh for uh you know some - some longer period of time or something, uh  that - that there would be more of a distinction.	no
23347	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	The different zone.	no
23348	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	uh, I - I don't know.	no
23349	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So, uh, from -	no
23350	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	from these charts,	no
23351	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	are - hmm, I'm just trying to  remember  where we  were,  but uh, were - you were interested in finding out if you can tell the difference between  overlap and single speakers by looking at the e- energy, like say, for example, the mean of the energy. Was that the idea? O_K.	no
23352	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
23353	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
23354	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
23355	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So, if you look at -	no
23356	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	on this page that has uh frame energy, you look at the mean for the overlap, that's forty-four point sixty-two versus the mean for the speakers, thirty-nine point sixty-two, so there seems to be more energy when there's overlapping which	no
23357	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
23358	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
23359	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
23360	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Which is the intuition, un- unfortunately there's a standard deviation of like ten, so	no
23361	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	makes sense, but -	no
23362	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
23363	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
23364	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah, different than standard deviation.	no
23365	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Oh.	no
23366	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	The  product of the  deviation is the vari- is the variance.	no
23367	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	For each one, yeah.	no
23368	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	But are we assuming	no
23369	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
23370	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	that you could	no
23371	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	know the energy for a speaker when there's no overlap? I mean	no
23372	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I can imagine a model where you say, O_K, you know	no
23373	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And -	no
23374	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I'm - I'm gonna give myself - it's cheating, but	no
23375	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	not completely if they're	no
23376	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	often not overlapping	no
23377	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and normalized for the speaker	no
23378	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
23379	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	or is that	no
23380	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	not allowed. I mean, what's the -	no
23381	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, that's what I was suggesting, that y- you wanna do some kind of longer time normalization eh with the -	no
23382	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
23383	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
23384	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	But -	no
23385	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	even if you make a mistake occasionally, that - that i- is roughly	no
23386	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	right	no
23387	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	i- is there some	no
23388	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	corresponding to that  speaker,  so that if you, if - if uh -  if you	no
23389	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
23390	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	because that - that's gonna spread out these distributions really a lot, to  not  do any kind of normalization, and so that - that could mask the effect somewhat.	no
23391	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	right	no
23392	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	so the um - just one more clarifying question - On the overlap category,  is that	no
23393	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	overlapping of speakers	no
23394	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	only?	no
23395	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
23396	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	It doesn't include some of the other sounds?  O_K.	no
23397	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	No.	no
23398	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	It's a pu- pure overlapping zone. I mean that eh overlapping between two, three, four eh eh speaker.	no
23399	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So that's why it doesn't add up down -	no
23400	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K.	no
23401	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And -	no
23402	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K.	no
23403	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And did - is this from the mixed signal?	no
23404	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Th-	no
23405	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
23406	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	O_K, so there  is   some  normalization  already,  in that they've been  volume  equalized	no
23407	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right,	no
23408	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	right.	no
23409	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
23410	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	uh over the entire signal.	no
23411	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right.	no
23412	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	That's what makes it  seem difficult, because you're already left with	no
23413	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Because they - they're -	no
23414	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
23415	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	a high standard deviation and they're already roughly	no
23416	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
23417	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	so that each person's  hearable,  right? - so- sort of equally loud, perceptually anyway.	no
23418	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right.	no
23419	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right.	no
23420	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	What  about  doing it with just the single channels?	no
23421	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Sorry?	no
23422	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	What about,	no
23423	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	uh	no
23424	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Say	no
23425	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	this graphic?	no
23426	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, I - I'm thinking - so	no
23427	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	they're raising the question about the fact	no
23428	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	that	no
23429	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	if you use the  mixed  signal,	no
23430	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah. I use the mixed signal	no
23431	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	there's already been a -	no
23432	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	without  normalization   -	no
23433	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	without normalization, but -	no
23434	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, but the mixed signal already  has  a normalization in it.	no
23435	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I - I'm wo-	no
23436	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Exactly.  So what I'm wondering is what about doing  some  of this with the	no
23437	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	but	no
23438	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	single  channel	no
23439	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Ah.	no
23440	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	recordings.	no
23441	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I - I don't study the single channel	no
23442	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	yet	no
23443	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	but eh	no
23444	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	is eh - is an idea.	no
23445	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, I think it'll be worse, right, I think the mixed -	no
23446	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	to - to begin to work with the	no
23447	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	eh  with the one- single channel. Now.	no
23448	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I have  another  - another thought.	no
23449	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Um, this is - this is  frame  energy, of course frame -	no
23450	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	frames have a lot of	no
23451	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	variance to them because different sounds	no
23452	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	are different	no
23453	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	loudnesses.	no
23454	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So	no
23455	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
23456	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I mean, what if you took uh one second	no
23457	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	chunks or something like that. Or - or	no
23458	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	maybe not even a  second,  maybe a quarter of a second or something, so that you would typically have two or three basically syllable kind of length -	no
23459	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah, like two hundred milliseconds or twenty to twenty-five frames, or	no
23460	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
23461	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right.	no
23462	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Or window it - hamming window.	no
23463	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
23464	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So then you - you'll - you know -	no
23465	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
23466	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Something,  yeah.	no
23467	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So - so I mean, so you know two hundred, three hundred four hundred mill- some longer chunk of  time,	no
23468	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
23469	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and then you looked at the amount of energy in  that.	no
23470	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and how does  that  vary over these different cases.	no
23471	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Uh-huh.	no
23472	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	or  voiced  regions, I mean	no
23473	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	can we tell? can we - sorry	no
23474	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	or voiced regions.	no
23475	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Interesting.	no
23476	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I mean, is it  known  whether something's voiced here, or is it roughly estimate - estimateable?	no
23477	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, I mean, you could do a -	no
23478	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	you could first determine that something was voiced or not.	no
23479	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I mean like if  one  speaker's voicing and the other one  isn't  and they're overlapping,	no
23480	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	do we know that the first speaker's voicing, or not?	no
23481	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Well, I mean the overlaps are typically more than just a tiny little bit of time and so uh there could be voiced and non-voiced pieces during the overlap.	no
23482	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Ah.	no
23483	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Huh.	no
23484	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Mm-hmm.	no
23485	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	But will we be able t- to detect the voicing when there's overlap?	no
23486	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	That's what  I just wondered.	no
23487	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	I don't  know,	no

23491	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	it's -	no
23492	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So  if  we could, or if you  could  do  some  of it,	no
23493	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	this - this has to do with these questions of harmonicity, and so forth, right?	no
23494	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no

23496	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
23497	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
23498	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	then um, voiced regions would be, like, probably more informative,	no
23499	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yeah.	no
23500	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	for energy because -	no
23501	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right, so you could do something like, uh	no
23502	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	and pi- and pitch for that matter.	no
23503	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	but -	no
23504	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Sure.	no
23505	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	But I think what will be easy for him to do would be to do this thing of looking over a large enough region of  time.  Cuz if you look over a large enough region of  time,   most  of the time you'll have some voiced -	no
23506	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	a fair amount of voiced uh energy  in  it.	no
23507	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Right.	no
23508	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	And so I think that would be -	no

23685	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	harmonics would be very important.	no
23686	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	So if you can find voiced regions and - You know,  if  you have two speakers and they're both voicing	no
23687	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Yes.	no
23688	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	unless they have very similar, you know, pitch, you should be able to see the  difference in harmonics pretty clearly	no

23690	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	Um -	no
23691	transcript	transcript_Bmr008	just by counting them, I mean  yeah, so even if you're not exactly sure when the overlap starts and ends because there's some  non-voiced regions, at least you can  have these islands of reliability where you're pretty sure.	no

24036	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Um. Let's see. I guess  I would like to have a discussion about you know where we are on	no
24037	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	uh, recording, transcription  you know, basically you know where we are on the corpus.	no
24038	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Good.	no

24040	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	the other thing which I would like to talk about which is a real meta-quest, I think, deal is, uh, agendas.	no
24041	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So maybe I'll - I'll start with that actually. Uh,	yes

24045	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	the fact that he would  kinda  like to know,	no

24047	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	he's	no
24048	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	sort of  peripherally  involved to this point,	no
24049	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	and if there's gonna be a topic about -	no
24050	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	discussion about something that he	no
24051	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	uh strongly cares about then he would come and -	no
24052	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And I think part of -	no
24053	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	part  of his motivation with this  is that  he's trying to help us  out,  in the -	no
24054	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	because of uh	no
24055	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	the fact that the meetings are - are tending to become	no
24056	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	reasonably large now on days when everybody shows up and so,	no
24057	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	he figures he could help that out by  not  showing - and - and I'm sure help	no
24058	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Mmm.	no
24059	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	out his own time.	no
24060	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	by not showing up if it's a	no
24061	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	meeting that he's - he's -	no
24062	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So, uh in order -	no
24063	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I'd - I think that	no
24064	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	this is a  wish  on his part. Uh. It's actually gonna be hard because it seems like a lot of times	no

24067	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Right.	no
24068	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	we could  try  anyway, uh,	no
24069	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	do another try at coming up with the agenda	no
24070	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	uh, at some point before the meeting,	no
24071	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	uh, say the day before.	no
24072	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Well maybe it would be a good idea for one of us to  like on Wednesday, or Tuesday send out a reminder for people to send in agenda items.	no
24073	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
24074	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	O_K.	no
24075	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	You - you wanna volunteer to do that?	no
24076	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Sure.	no
24077	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	O_K.	no
24078	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Alright so we'll send out agenda request.	no
24079	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Uh.	no
24080	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Let me	no
24081	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	That'll be - I think that'll help -	no
24082	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I'll put that on my spare brain or it will not  get done.	no
24083	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	That'll help a lot, actually.	no
24084	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah, I have to tell you for the uh - for the admin meeting that we have, Lila does that um every time before an admin meeting.	no
24085	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And uh, she ends up getting the agenda requests uh, uh ten minutes before the meeting. But - but -  But.	no
24086	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Uh.	no
24087	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	But we can  try.	no
24088	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Maybe it'll work.	no
24089	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Mmm.	no
24090	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.  Maybe.	no
24091	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Weirder things have happened.	no
24092	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
24093	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I'm wondering if he were to just, uh, specify particular topics, I mean.	no
24094	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Maybe we'd be able to meet that request of his a little more.	no
24095	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I would - I would also guess that as we get more into processing the data and things like that there'll be more things of interest to him.	no
24096	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Well then -	yes
24097	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I would - I would also guess that as we get more into processing the data and things like that there'll be more things of interest to him.	no
24098	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
24099	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Actually it -	no
24100	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	This - this maybe brings up another topic which is um -	no
24101	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So we're done with that topic.	no
24102	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	The other topic I was thinking of was	no
24103	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	the sta- status on microphones and channels, and all that.	no
24104	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah, actually I - I was going to say we need to  talk about that too.	no
24105	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
24106	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Why - why don't we do that.	no
24107	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	O_K. Um, the new microphones, the  two  new ones are in.	no
24108	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Um.  And they are being assembled as we speak, I hope.	no
24109	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And I didn't bring my car today so I'm gonna pick them up tomorrow.	no
24110	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Um, and then the other  question  I was  thinking  about is -	no
24111	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	well, a  couple  things. First of all,	no
24112	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	if the other headsets are a lot more comfortable, we should probably just go ahead and get them.	no
24113	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So we'll have to evaluate that when they come in,	no
24114	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	and get people's opinions on - on what they think of them.	no
24115	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Uh-	no
24116	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Um, then the  other  question I had is maybe we should get another  wireless.	no
24117	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Another wireless setup. I mean it's  expensive,  but it does seem to be  better than the  wired.	no
24118	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So how many channels do you get to have	no
24119	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	in a wireless setup?	no
24120	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Um,	no
24121	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	well,	no
24122	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I'm pretty sure that you can daisy-chain them together so what we would do is replace the wired mikes with wireless.	no
24123	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So we currently have one base station with six wireless mike,	no
24124	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	possibility of six wireless receivers, and apparently you  can  chain those together.	no
24125	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And so we could replace our wired mikes with wireless if we bought another base station and more wireless mikes.	no
24126	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So, um.	no
24127	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And -	no
24128	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So let's see we -	no
24129	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So, you know it's still, it's fifteen minus six.	no
24130	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Right? So we could have up to nine.	no
24131	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And right now we can have up to six.	no
24132	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Right.	no
24133	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And we  have  five, we're getting one more.	no
24134	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
24135	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And it's um, about nine hundred dollars for the base station,	no
24136	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	and then eight hundred per channel.	no
24137	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Oh. So yeah so the only -	no
24138	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Beyond the mike - the cost of the mikes the only thing is the base station that's nine hundred dollars.	no
24139	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Right.	no
24140	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Oh, we should do it.	no
24141	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	O_K.	no
24142	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
24143	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	O_K, so I'll look into how you daisy-chain them and - and then just go ahead and order them.	no
24144	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
24145	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I don't quite understand how that - how that works,. If -	no
24146	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So we're not  increasing  the number of channels.	no
24147	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	No, we're just replacing the wired - the two wired that are still  working,	no
24148	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	O_K. O_K. I see.	no
24149	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	along with a couple of the wired that  aren't  working,	no
24150	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	one  of the wired that's not working,	no
24151	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	with a wireless.	no
24152	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah. Basically we found -	no
24153	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Three wireds work, right?	no
24154	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I - I guess three wireds work, yeah.	no
24155	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah. Yeah.	no
24156	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah. But we've had more problems with that.	no
24157	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yep.	no
24158	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And that sort of bypasses the whole - the whole Jimbox thing and all that.	no
24159	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Right.	no
24160	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And so	no
24161	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	um,	no
24162	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	we - we seem to have uh, a reliable way of getting the data in, which is through the ra- Sony radio mikes, as long as we're conscious about the batteries.	no
24163	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	That seems to be the key	no
24164	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Right.	no
24165	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Everyone's battery O_K?	no
24166	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	issue.	no
24167	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I checked them this morning, they should be.	no
24168	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	O_K.	no
24169	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
24170	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Um,	no
24171	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	That's the only thing with them. But the quality seems really good and -	no
24172	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Um I heard from U_W that they're - they're uh very close to getting their, uh setup purchased. They're - they're - they're buying something that you can just sort of buy off the shelf.	no
24173	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Well we should talk to them about it because I know that S_R_I is also in the process of looking at stuff,	no
24174	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	and so, you know, what we should try to keep everyone - on the same page with that.	no
24175	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
24176	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	S_R_I, really?	no
24177	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
24178	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Oh.	no
24179	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	They got sa- apparent-	no
24180	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Well,	no
24181	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Maybe  this needs to be bleeped out? I have no clue.	no
24182	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Uh, I don't know. Probably we shouldn't - probably we shouldn't talk about funding stuff.	no
24183	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I don't know how much of it's public.	no
24184	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Right.	no
24185	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
24186	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	But anyway there's - there's - there's uh, uh other activities that are going on there and - and uh - and NIST and U_W. So.	no
24187	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Um. But - but yeah I thin- I think that at least the message we can tell other people is that our experience is - is quite positive with the Sony, uh,  radio-mikes .	no
24188	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Right.	no
24189	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Now the  one  thing that you  have  said that actually concerns me a little is you're talking about changing the headsets meaning changing the connector,	no
24190	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	which means some hand-soldering or something, right?	no
24191	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Uh, no, we're having the -  them   do  it. So it's so- hand-soldering it, but I'm not doing it.	no
24192	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	No?	no
24193	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Oh.	no
24194	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	O_K.	no
24195	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So, they - they charge  right.	no
24196	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Nothing against you and your  hand-soldering  but -	no
24197	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	You've never  seen  my hand-soldering.	no
24198	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	But uh,	no
24199	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Uh,	no
24200	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	O_K, so that's being done professionally and -  Yeah.	no
24201	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	a- as I said they're coming in.	no
24202	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I - I mean - Yeah. I mean.	no
24203	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
24204	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	As professionally as I guess you can get it done.	no
24205	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Well,	no
24206	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	it could - if they do a lot of it, it's -	no
24207	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I mean i- it's just their repair shop.	no
24208	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Right? Their maintenance people.	no
24209	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Well, we'll see what it - it's like. That - tha- that  can  be quite good.	no
24210	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yep.	no
24211	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Th- this - Yeah, O_K.	no
24212	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Good. Yeah. So let's go with that. Uh,	no
24213	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And, I mean we'll see,  tomorrow,  you know, what it looks like.	no
24214	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	yes
24215	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And, I mean we'll see,  tomorrow,  you know, what it looks like.	no
24216	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
24217	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So, um,	no
24218	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	uh,	no
24219	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Dave isn't here but he was going to	no
24220	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	start working on some things with the digits.	no
24221	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Uh,	no
24222	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	so he'll be interested in what's going on with  that.  I guess - Was - the decision last time was that the -	no
24223	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	the uh transcribers were going to be doing stuff with the digits as well?	no
24224	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Mm-hmm. Yeah.	no
24225	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Has that started, or is that - ?	no
24226	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Uh, it would be to use his interface and I was going to meet with him today about that.	no
24227	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Right, so, the decision was that Jane did  not  want the transcribers to be doing any of the  paperwork.  So I did the - all  that  last week.	no
24228	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So all the - all the  forms  are now  on the computer.	no
24229	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And uh, then I have a bunch of scripts that we'll read those and	no
24230	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	let the uh  transcribers use different tools. And I just want to talk to Jane about how we transition to using those.	no
24231	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Mm-hmm.	no
24232	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So he has a nice set up that they -	no
24233	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	it w- it will be efficient for them to do that.	no
24234	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	O_K. So anyway -	no
24235	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I - I don't think it'll take too long.	no
24236	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So, you know, just uh, a matter of a few days I suspect.	no
24237	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So anyway I think we - we have at least one uh, user	no
24238	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	for the digits once they get done, which will be Dave.	no
24239	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Right.	no
24240	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	O_K.	no
24241	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I've already done five or six  sets.	no
24242	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So if he wanted to, you know, just have a few to start with, he  could.	no
24243	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah, he might - he might be asking -	no
24244	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	You know, and I also have a bunch of scripts that will, like, generate P_files and run recognition on them also.	no
24245	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Right.	no
24246	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	O_K.	no
24247	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Uh, is Dave -	no
24248	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I don't know if Dave is on the list,	no
24249	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	if he's invited to these meetings, uh	no
24250	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	if he knows.	no
24251	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I don't tend to get an invitation  myself  for them even.	no
24252	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	No, no.	no
24253	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Uh, we don't have a active one but I'll make sure he's on the list.	no
24254	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
24255	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Should we  call  him? I mean is he - d- is he definitely not  available  today?	no
24256	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I don't know.	no
24257	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Should I call his office and see?	no
24258	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Uh, well i- it's uh -	no
24259	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	He  was  in. Yeah.	no
24260	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I mean, he's  still  taking classes, so uh, he may well have conflicts.	no
24261	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
24262	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah, he was in  s-	no
24263	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	He wasn't there at cof-	no
24264	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah, so this might be a conflict for him.	no
24265	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
24266	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	O_K.	no
24267	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
24268	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	O_K.	no
24269	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Uh, so.	no
24270	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah didn't he say his signal-processing class was like	no
24271	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I think he has a class. Yeah.	no
24272	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Tuesdays and Thursdays?	no
24273	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah. He might have.	no
24274	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Oh, O_K.	no
24275	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	You talking about David Gelbart?	no
24276	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Oh well, whatever.	no
24277	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
24278	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yes.	no
24279	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
24280	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
24281	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
24282	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah, I think he's taking two twenty-five A_ which is now.	no
24283	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	O_K.	no
24284	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So.	no
24285	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah. O_K.	no
24286	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
24287	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So, that's why we're not seeing him. O_K.	no
24288	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Uh, transcriptions, uh, beyond the digits, where we are, and so on.	yes
24289	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Uh, transcriptions, uh, beyond the digits, where we are, and so on.	no
24290	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	O_K.	no
24291	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Um -	no
24292	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And the - and the recordings also, just where we are.	no
24293	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
24294	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Well,	no
24295	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	so um, should we - we don't wan- wanna do the recording status first, or - ?	no
24296	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Well, we have about thirty-two hours  uh	no
24297	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	as of,	no
24298	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I guess a week and a half ago, so we probably now have about thirty- five  hours.	no
24299	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And - and that's - that's uh - How much of that is digits?	no
24300	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	It's uh - that's including digits, right?	no
24301	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	That's including digits. I haven't separated it out so I have no clue how much of that is digits.	no
24302	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So -	no
24303	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
24304	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So anyway there's at least probably thirty hours, or something of -	no
24305	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	There's got to be more than thirty hour - i- it couldn't - of -	no
24306	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Of - of  non-digits?	no
24307	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Mmm.	no
24308	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Of non-digits.	no
24309	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah, absolutely. I mean, the digits don't take up that much time.	no
24310	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah, yeah.	no
24311	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	O_K.	no
24312	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	O_K, and the transcribers h- I, uh, don't have the exact numbers, but I	no
24313	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	think it would come to about eleven hours that are finished uh, transcribing from them right now.  The next step is to - that I'm working on is to insure that the data are  clean  first,	no
24314	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	and then  channelized.  What I mean by  clean  is that they're spell-checked, that the mark-up is consistent all the way throughout, and also that we now incorporate these additional conventions that	no
24315	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	uh,  Liz  requested in terms of um, um  in terms of having a s- a	no
24316	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	systematic handling of numbers, and acronyms which I hadn't been specific about.	no
24317	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	"Um, for example, i- they'll say uh ""ninety-two"". And you know, so how - you could -"	no
24318	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Nine two, right.	no
24319	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	"e- Exactly. So if you just say ""nine two"", the - there are many s- ways that could have been expressed. An- and I just had them -"	no
24320	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I - I mean, a certain number of them  did  put the words down,	no
24321	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	but now we have a convention which also involves having it followed by, um, a gloss th- and things.	no
24322	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	You know, Jane?	no
24323	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Mm-hmm.	no
24324	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Um, one suggestion and you may already be doing this, but	no
24325	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I've noticed in the past that when I've gone	no
24326	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	through transcriptions and you know in - in order to build lexicons and things,	no
24327	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	if you um, just take all the transcriptions and separate them into words and then alphabetize them,	no
24328	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	a lot of times just scanning down that list you'll find a lot of  inconsistencies and mis-	no
24329	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Misspelled.	no
24330	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
24331	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	You're talking about the type token frequency listings, and I use those too.	no
24332	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Y- you mean just uh  on each - on each line there's a one word right?	no
24333	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	It's one token from the - from the corpus.	no
24334	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.	no
24335	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah, those are e- extremely efficient and I- and I - I agree that's a very good use of it.	no
24336	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Oh so you already have that, O_K.	no
24337	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Well that's - that's a way - that's - You know, the  spell-check	no
24338	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	basically  does  that but - but in addition - yes, that's - that's exactly the strategy  I  wanna do in terms of locating these things which are	no
24339	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	you know colloquial spoken forms which aren't in the lexicon.	no
24340	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Mm-hmm. Cuz a lot of times they'll appear  next  to each other,	no
24341	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Exactly.  And then you ca- then you can do a s-	no
24342	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
24343	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	and uh, i- in alphabetized  lists,  they'll appear  next  to each other	no
24344	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Absolutely. I agree.	no
24345	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	and - and so it makes it easier.	no
24346	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	That's a very good - that's a very good uh, suggestion.	no
24347	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And that was - that's  my  strategy for handling a  lot  of these things, in terms of things that need to be  glossed.  I didn't get to that point but -	no
24348	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So there are numbers, then there are acronyms, and then um, there's a - he- she wants the uh, actually a -	no
24349	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	an explicit marker of what type of comment this is, so i- curly b- inside the curly brackets I'm gonna put either	no
24350	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	"""VOC"" for vocalized, like cough or like laugh or whatever,"	no
24351	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	"""NONVOC"" for door-slam, and ""GLOSS"" for things that have to do with - if they said a s- a spoken form with this - m- this pronunciation error. I already had that convention but I -"	no
24352	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Right.	no
24353	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Oh that's great.	no
24354	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I haven't been asking these people to do it systematically cuz I think it most - ha- most efficiently handled by uh - by a - a filter. That was what I was  always  planing on. So that, you know you get a whole long list -  exactly  what  you're  saying,	no
24355	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	"you get a whole list of things that say ""curly bracket  laugh  curly bracket"","	no
24356	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Mm-hmm.	no
24357	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	then y- you know it's - it's - You - you risk less error if you handle it by a filter,	no
24358	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	than if you have this transcriber ch- laboriously typing in  sort of a  VOC space, so man-	no
24359	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
24360	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So many ways that error prone.	no
24361	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Right.	no
24362	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Right.	no
24363	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So, um,	no
24364	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	um I'm - I'm going to convert that via a filter, into these tagged uh, subcategorized comments,	no
24365	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	and same thing with you know,  we see  you get a subset	no
24366	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	when you do what  you're  saying, you end up with a s- with uh, you're collapsing across a frequency you just have the tokens and you can um, have a filter which more efficiently makes those changes. But the numbers and acronyms have to be handled by hand, because, you know I mean, jus-	no
24367	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Mm-hmm.	no
24368	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Mm-hmm.	no
24369	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	You don't know what they could be.	no
24370	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	"Yeah now TIMIT's clear um  and P_L_P is clear  but uh there are things that are not so well known, in - or - or have variant - u- u- uses like the numbers you can say ""nine two"" or you can say ""ninety-two"", and uh"	no
24371	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
24372	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So how are you doing the -	no
24373	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I'd handle the numbers individually.	no
24374	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	How are you doing the uh, acronyms so if I say P_Z_M what would it appear on the transcript?	no
24375	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	It would be separate - The letters would be separated in space and potentially they'll have a curly bracket thing afterwards e- but I'm not sure if that's necessary,  clarifying  what it is, so gloss of  whatever.	no
24376	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	O_K.	no
24377	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Mm-hmm.	no
24378	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Right.	no
24379	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I don't know if that's really necessary to do that.	no
24380	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Maybe it's a nice thing to do because of it then indicating this is	no
24381	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	uh, a step away from i- indicating that it really is intentional that those spaces are there, and indicating why they're there to indicate that it's uh  the	no
24382	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Mm-hmm.	no
24383	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	you know,  uh enumerated, or i- it's not a good way of saying - but it's - it's the  specific uh way of stating these - these letters.	no
24384	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Right. So it sounds good.	no
24385	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And so anyway, the clean - those are those things and then channelized is to then um, get it into this multichannel format.	no
24386	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And at  that  point then it's ready for use by Liz and Don.	no
24387	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	But that's been my top priority - beyond getting it  tanel-  channelized, the next step is to work on tightening up the boundaries of the time bins.	no
24388	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
24389	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Right.	no
24390	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And uh,  Thilo  had a - e- e- a breakthrough with this - this last week in terms of getting the channel-based um	no
24391	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	uh s- s- speech-nonspeech segmentation um, up and running and I haven't - I haven't been able to use that yet cuz I'm working s- re- this is my top priority - get the data clean, and channelized.	no
24392	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I actually gave	no
24393	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Have you also been doing spot checks, Jane?	no
24394	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Oh   yes.  Well you see that's part of the cleaning process. I spent	no
24395	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Okay, good.	no
24396	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	um actually um I have a segment of ten minutes that was transcribed by  two  of our transcribers,	no
24397	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Oh good. Good.	no
24398	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	and I went through it last night, it's - it's almost spooky how similar these are, word for word. And there are some differences in commas cuz commas I - I left them discretion at commas.	no
24399	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Right.	no
24400	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Uh - and so because it's not part of our st- of our ne-  needed  conventions.	no
24401	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Mm-hmm.	no
24402	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And um,	no
24403	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	and - so they'll be a difference in  commas,  but it's word-by-word the  same,	no
24404	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	in - in  huge  patches of the data. And I have t- ten minute stretch where I can - where I can show that. And - and  sometimes  it turns out that one of these transcribers has a better ear for technical jargon, and the other one has a better ear for colloquial speech. So	no
24405	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	"um, the one i- i- the colloquial speech person picked up ""gobbledy-gook"". And the other one didn't. And on  this  side, this one's picking up things like ""neural nets"" and the one that's good on the sp- o- on th- the vocabulary on the uh colloquial  didn't."	no
24406	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Hmm.	no
24407	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Right.	no
24408	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	"When - for the person who missed ""gobbledy-gook"" what did they put?"	no
24409	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	It was an interesting approximation, put in parentheses, cuz I have this convention that, i- if they're not sure what it was, they put it in parentheses.	no
24410	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Oh.	no
24411	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So they tried to approximate it, but it was -	no
24412	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Oh good.	no
24413	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	it was spelled G_A_B_B_L -	no
24414	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Sort of how it sounds.	no
24415	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yes. More of an attempt to - I mean apparently it was very  clear  to her that these - the- a- this - this was a  sound  - these are the  sounds,  but -	no
24416	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
24417	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	It was a technical term that she didn't recognize,	no
24418	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
24419	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah. But she knew that she didn't know it. Maybe it was a technical ter- exactly. But she - even though her  technical  perception is just really - uh you know I've - I'm tempted to ask her if she's taken any	no
24420	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	"courses in this area or if she's taken cognitive science courses then cuz ""neural nets"" and - oh she has some things that are - oh ""downsampled"", she got that right."	no
24421	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Right.	no
24422	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Hmm.	no
24423	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And some of these are rather  uh unexpected.	no
24424	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Obscure, yeah.	no
24425	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	But ch- ten solid uh - m- ch- s- chunk of ten solid minutes where they both coded the same data. And um -	no
24426	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And - and again the  main  track that you're working with is elev- eleven hours? Is that right?	no
24427	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yes exactly.	no
24428	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah, O_K.	no
24429	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And that's part of this -	no
24430	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Eleven hours.	no
24431	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Is that - is that - that including digits?	no
24432	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yes it is. Mm-hmm.	no
24433	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
24434	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So let's say roughly  ten hours or so of -	no
24435	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I mean it's probably more than that but - but with - of - of non-digits.	no
24436	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	It'd be more than that because I - my recollection is the minutes - that da- digits don't take more than half a minute. Per person.	no
24437	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
24438	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Oh, O_K.	no
24439	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	But um  the - the total set that I gave them is twelve hours of tape,	no
24440	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Oh, I see.	no
24441	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	But they haven't gotten to the end of that yet. So they're still working - some of them are - Two of them are still working on completing that.	no
24442	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Oh, I see.	no
24443	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
24444	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Boy,  they're  moving right  along.	no
24445	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah. They  are.  Mm-hmm. They're very efficient.	no
24446	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
24447	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	There're some who have more hours that they devote to it than others. Yeah.	no
24448	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Mm-hmm.	no
24449	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Mm-hmm.	no
24450	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So what - what - what's the deal with - with your -	yes
24451	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So what - what - what's the deal with - with your -	no
24452	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	The channel u- thing?	no
24453	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
24454	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Oh, it's just uh, I ran the recognizer -  uh,  the   speech-nonspeech detector on different channels and,	no
24455	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	it's just in uh - in this new multi-channel format and output, and	no
24456	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Oh, I see.	no
24457	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I just gave one - one meeting to - to Liz who wanted to - to try it for - for the recognizer	no
24458	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	as uh, apparently the recognizer had problems with those long chunks of speech, which took too much memory or whatever,	no
24459	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Right.	no
24460	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
24461	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	and so  she - she will try that I think and -   I'm - I'm working on it. So, I hope -	no
24462	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Is this anything different than the H_M_M system you were using before?	no
24463	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
24464	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	No.	no
24465	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Uh,	no
24466	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I  mmm, use some - some different features but not - not - The basic thing is this H_M_M base.	no
24467	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Mm-hmm.	no
24468	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So there's still no -	no
24469	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	no knowledge using different channels at the same time. You know what I mean?	no
24470	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	There is some, uh as the energy is normalized across channels yeah.	no
24471	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Across all of them. O_K.	no
24472	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So. But basically that's one of the main changes.	no
24473	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Mm-hmm.	no
24474	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Mm-hmm.	no
24475	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	What are some of the other features? Besides the	no
24476	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	energy? You said you're trying some different features, or something.	no
24477	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Oh I just uh -  Mmm,	no
24478	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I just use um our loudness-based things now as they - before there were - they were some in - in the log domain and I - I changed this to the -	no
24479	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Cu- Cube root?	no
24480	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	to the -	no
24481	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
24482	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	To -	no
24483	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	No, I changed this to the - to the - to the loudness thingy with the - with the how do you call it? I'm not sure.	no
24484	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Hmm.	no
24485	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Ah.	no
24486	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	With the, uh -	no
24487	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Fletcher Munson?	no
24488	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	No.	no
24489	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I'm not sure about the term.	no
24490	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Oh, O_K.	no
24491	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Uh, I'll look it up.  And say it to you.	no
24492	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah, alright.	no
24493	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Uh, O_K, and - Yeah. That's - that's basically the - the - the thing.	no
24494	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	O_K.	no
24495	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah, and I - and I tried t- to normalize uh -	no
24496	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	uh the features, there's loudness and modified loudness, um, within one channel,	no
24497	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	because they're,	no
24498	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	yeah to - to be able to distinguish between foreground and  background  speech.	no
24499	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And it works quite well. But, not always.	no
24500	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Uh-huh.	no
24501	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Uh-huh.	no
24502	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So.	no
24503	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	O_K.	no
24504	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Good.	no
24505	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Um, let's see.	no
24506	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I think the uh -	no
24507	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Were - were you basically done with the transcription part?	no
24508	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So I guess the next thing is this uh - bleep editing.	yes
24509	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Were - were you basically done with the transcription part?	no
24510	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So I guess the next thing is this uh - bleep editing.	no
24511	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Right. So the -	no
24512	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	The  idea  is that we need to have - We need to provide the transcripts to every participant of every meeting	no
24513	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	to give them an opportunity to bleep out sections they don't want. So I've written a bunch of tools that will generate web pages,	no
24514	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	uh  with  the transcription in it so that they can click on  them   and  piece   - pieces and they can scroll through and read them, and then they can  check  on each one if they want it excluded.	no
24515	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And then, it's a  form,  H_T_M_L form, so they can submit it and it will end up sending me email with the times that they want excluded.	no
24516	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And so, uh, some of the  questions  on this is what do we do about the privacy issue.	no
24517	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
24518	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And so I thought about this a  little  bit and I think the  best  way to do it is every participant will have a password, a  single  password. Each  person  will have a single password, user name and password.	no
24519	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And then each  meeting,  we'll only allow the participants who were at that meeting to look at it.	no
24520	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And that way each  person  only has to remember one password.	no
24521	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I - I can't help but wonder if this is maybe a little more elaborate than is needed. I mean if people have -	no
24522	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Uh, I mean, for  me  I would actually want to have some pieces of paper that had the transcription and I would sort of flip through it.	no
24523	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	"And then  um  if I thought it was O_K, I'd say ""it's O_K""."	no
24524	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Mm-hmm.	no
24525	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And, I -	no
24526	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	uh - I mean it depends how this really ends up working out, but I guess my thought was that the	no
24527	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	occasion of somebody wondering whether something was O_K or not and needing to listen to it	no
24528	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	was gonna be extremely rare.	no
24529	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Right, I mean so th- th- th- the fact that you could listen to it over the web is a minor thing that I had already done for  other reasons.	no
24530	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	O_K.	no
24531	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And so that - that's a minor part of it, I just wanted some web interface so that people - you didn't actually have to send everyone the text.	no
24532	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So m- what my intention to do is that as the transcripts become  ready,	no
24533	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	um  I would take them, and generate the web pages and send email to every participant or  contact  them using the contact method they wanted,	no
24534	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	"and just uh,  tell  them, ""here's the web page"","	no
24535	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	"um, ""you need a password"". So th- th- question number one is how do we distribute the passwords,"	no
24536	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	and question number  two  is how else do we wanna provide this information if they want it.	no
24537	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	That's -	no
24538	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I think what I was sort of saying is that if you just say	no
24539	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	"""here is a - here is -"""	no
24540	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I mean this maybe it sounds paleolithic but - but I just thought if you handed them some sheets of paper,	no
24541	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	"that said, uh, ""here's what was said in this transcription is it O_K with you?"	no
24542	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	"and if it  is,  here's this  other  sheet of paper that you sign that says that it's O_K"". And then they'd hand it back to you."	no
24543	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I think that um there are a subset of people who will want printouts that we can certainly provide.	no
24544	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	But certainly  I  wouldn't want a printout. These are  big,  and I would much rather be	no
24545	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	ha- be able to just sit and leaf through it.	no
24546	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	You find it easier to go through a large - I mean how do you read books?	no
24547	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Well I certainly read books by hand. But for something like this, I think it's easier to do it on the web.	no
24548	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Really?	no
24549	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I mean, it -	no
24550	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Cuz you're gonna get, you know, if I - I'm - I'm in a  bunch  of meetings and I don't wanna get a  stack  of these. I wanna just be able to go to - go to the web site  and visit it as I want.	no
24551	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Going to a web site is easy, but flipping through a hundred pounds - a hundred pages of stuff is  not  easy on the web.	no
24552	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Well, I don't think it's that much harder than, paper.	no
24553	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I have one question. So are you thinking that um the person would have a transcript and go strictly from the  transcript?  Because I - I do think that there's a benefit to being able to hear the	no
24554	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Really?	no
24555	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So.	no
24556	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	tone  of voice and the -	no
24557	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So here's the way I was imagining it, and maybe I'm wrong, but the way I imagined it was that	no
24558	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
24559	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	"um, the largest set of people is gonna go ""oh yeah, I didn't say anything funny in that meeting just go ahead, where's the - where's the release?"""	no
24560	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And then there'll be a  subset  of people, right? - O_K there's - I mean think of who it is we've been recording mostly. O_K there'll be a  subset  of people,	no
24561	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
24562	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	"who um, will say uh ""well, yeah, I really would like to see that."" And for them,"	no
24563	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	the easiest way to flip through, if it's a  really   large   document,	no
24564	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I mean unless you're  searching.   Searching,  of course, should be electronic, but if you're not - so if you provide some  search  mechanism you go to every place they said something or something like that, but see then we're getting more elaborate with this thing.	no
24565	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
24566	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Um	no
24567	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	if - if uh	no
24568	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	you don't have search mechanisms you just sort of have this really, really long document, I mean whenever I've had a  really,  really long document that it was sitting on the web, I've always ended up printing it out.	no
24569	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I mean, so it's - it's - I mean, you - you're - you're not necessarily gonna be sitting at the desk all the time, you wanna figure you have a train ride,	no
24570	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	and there's all these situations where - where I -	no
24571	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I mean, this is how I was imagining it, anyway. And then I figured,	no
24572	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	"that out of  that  group, there would be a subset who would go ""hmm you know I'm really not sure about this section here,"""	no
24573	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	and then  that  group would need it -	no
24574	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	S- It seems like i- if I'm right in that,	no
24575	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	it seems like you're setting it up for	no
24576	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	the  most  infrequent case, rather than for the most  frequent  case.	no
24577	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So that uh, now we have to worry about privacy, we have to worry about all these passwords, for different people	no
24578	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Well, no fre- for the most -	no
24579	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	"For the most frequent case they just say  ""it's O_K"" and then they're done."	no
24580	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And I think  almost everyone would rather do that by email than any other method.	no
24581	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Mm-hmm.	no
24582	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	The other thing too is it seems like - Go ahead.	no
24583	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Um,	no
24584	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	yeah, that's true.	no
24585	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I mean, cuz you don't  have  to visit the web page if you don't want to.	no
24586	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
24587	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I guess - Yeah, I guess we don't need their signature. I guess an email O_K is alright.	no
24588	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Oh that was another thing I - I had  assumed  that we didn't need their signature, that it - that an email approval was sufficient.	no
24589	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	But  I don't actually know.	no
24590	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Are - are people going to be allowed to bleep out sections of a meeting where they weren't speaking?	no
24591	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yes.	no
24592	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I also - mm-hmm.	no
24593	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	If someone feels strongly enough about it,	no
24594	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	then I - I - I think they  should  be allowed to do that.	no
24595	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Uh	no
24596	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So that means other people are editing what you say?	no
24597	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
24598	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I don't know about that.	no
24599	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I don't know if I  like  that.	no
24600	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	"Well, the only other choice is that the person would say ""no, don't distribute this meeting at  all "", and I would rather they were able to edit out other people then just say ""don't distribute it at all""."	no
24601	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	But th-	no
24602	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	what they signed in the consent form,	no
24603	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	was something that said you can use  my  voice.	no
24604	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Well, but if -	no
24605	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Right?	no
24606	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	if someone is having a conversation, and you only bleep out one  side  of it, that's not sufficient.	no
24607	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
24608	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah, but that's  our  decision then. Right?	no
24609	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Um, I don't  think  so.	no
24610	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I mean, because if I  object  to the conversation. If I  say	no
24611	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I  think it is.	no
24612	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	"""we were having a conversation, and I consider that conversation private,"""	no
24613	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	and I consider that your  side  of it is  enough  for other people to infer, I wanna be able to bleep out your side.	no
24614	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	The - I agree that the consent forms were - uh, I cons- agree with what Adam's saying, that  um,	no
24615	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	the consent form did leave open this possibility that they could edit things which they found offensive whe- whether they said them or didn't say them.	no
24616	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I see.	no
24617	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	"And the other thing is from the standpoint of the l- of the l- I'm not a law- lawyer, but it strikes me that  uh, we wouldn't want someone to say ""oh yes, I was a little concerned about it but  it was too hard to access""."	no
24618	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	O_K, well, if that's what it said.	no
24619	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So I think it's kind of nice to have this facility to  listen  to it. Now - in terms of like editing it by  hand,  I mean I think it's - i- some people  would  find that easier to specify the  bleep  part	no
24620	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	by having a document they edited. But - but it seems to me that sometimes um,	no
24621	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	you know i- if a person had a bad day, and they had a tone in their voice that they didn't really like, you know it's nice - it's nice to be able to listen to it and be sure that that was O_K.	no
24622	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I mean I can certainly provide a printable version if people want it.	no
24623	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Um  I mean it's also a mixture of people, I mean some people are r-	no
24624	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Um.	no
24625	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	do their work primarily by sitting at the computer, flipping around the web, and others do  not.	no
24626	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Others would consider it - this uh - a -	no
24627	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yep.	no
24628	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	a set of skills that they would have to gain.	no
24629	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	You know? It depends on what meetings.	no
24630	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Well I think most of the people in the meetings are the former.	no
24631	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	That's true.	no
24632	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So far.	no
24633	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So.	no
24634	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	In the meetings  so  far, yeah.	no
24635	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yep.	no
24636	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	But we're trying to expand this, right?	no
24637	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So I - I - I actually think that paper is the more universal thing.	no
24638	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Right.	no
24639	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And that -	no
24640	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Mm-hmm. Yeah.	no
24641	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Well, but if they want to print it out that's alright. I think everyone in the meeting can access the web.	no
24642	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	No, I think  we  have to be able to print it out. It's not just if  they  want to print it out. I - I think -	no
24643	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	O_K, so does that mean that I can't use email?	no
24644	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Or what?	no
24645	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Cuz you could send it through email you're thinking.	no
24646	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I - I th- well - we - there was this -	no
24647	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Well, I don't think I - well I don't think we can send the  text  through email because of the privacy issues.	no
24648	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Good. For security? Yeah, O_K good. Good point.	no
24649	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	No.	no
24650	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
24651	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Right.	no
24652	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Um.	no
24653	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	@@	no
24654	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	"So giving them, you think a web site to say, ""if you wanna print it out here it is"", is not sufficient?"	no
24655	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
24656	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I-	no
24657	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Certainly for everybody who's been in the meetings so far it would be sufficient. I'm just wondering about -	no
24658	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah, I'm just thinking for people that that's not sufficient for, what - the only sufficient thing would be for me to walk up to them and  hand  it to them.	no
24659	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	You could mail it to them. Get an- a mailing address.	no
24660	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
24661	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Equivalent.	no
24662	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	But -	no
24663	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	But I think it's easier to drop in the box.	no
24664	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	"Just put the button on - on the web page which say ""please send me the - the scripts""."	no
24665	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Oh that's interesting.	no
24666	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	That's right.	no
24667	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
24668	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	What um - When you display it on the web page, what are - what are you showing them? Utterances, or - ?	no
24669	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Mm-hmm.	no
24670	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And so can they bleep within an utterance?	no
24671	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	No. Whole utterances only.	no
24672	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Whole utterances.	no
24673	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And that was just convenience for my sake, that it's uh, uh	no
24674	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	it would end up being fairly difficult to edit the transcripts if we would do it at the sub-utterance level.	no
24675	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Because this way I can just delete an entire line out of a transcript file rather than have to do it by hand.	no
24676	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	There's another aspect to this which maybe -	no
24677	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	is part of why this is bothering me.	no
24678	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Um, I think you're really trying very hard to make this as convenient as possible for people to do this.	no
24679	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I mean that's why I did the web form, because for  me  that would be my most convenient.	no
24680	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Mmm.	no
24681	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I - I - I understand. I think  that's  the bad idea.	no
24682	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I know where you're going.	no
24683	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Oh.	no
24684	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	See because you're gon- you're - uh -  Really.  You're gonna end up with all these little patchy things, whereas  really  what we want to do is have the - the - the  bias  towards letting it go.	no
24685	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Because nob- you know it -	no
24686	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	There was a - one or twi- once or twice, in the re- in the meetings we've heard, where somebody said something that they might be embarrassed by,	no
24687	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	but  overall  people are talking about technical topics. Nobody's gonna get hurt. Nobody's being l- libeled.	no
24688	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	You know, this is - this - we're - we're covering - We're playing the lawyer's game, and we're playing- we're - we're - we're looking for the extreme case.	no
24689	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	If we  really  orient it towards that extreme case, make it  really  easy, we're gonna end up encouraging a headache.	no
24690	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	That - I think that's -	no
24691	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I'm sort of psyching  myself  out here, I - I'm trying to - uh - but I - I think that's -	no
24692	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I guess I don't see having a few phrases here and there in a meeting being that mu- much of a headache, bleeped out. So.	no
24693	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Well, it's - but i-	no
24694	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I think what Morgan's saying is the easier it is, the more is gonna be bleeped.	no
24695	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And - and it  really  depends on what kind of research you're doing.	no
24696	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I think some researchers who are gonna be working with this corpus years from now are really gonna be cursing the fact that there's a bunch of stuff in there  that's missing from the dialogue.	no
24697	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Mm-hmm.	no
24698	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	You know, it depends on the kind of research they're doing, but it might be, uh  it might be really a - a pain.	no
24699	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
24700	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And, you know where it's  really  gonna hurt somebody, in some way - the one who said it or someone who is being spoken about,	no
24701	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	we definitely want to allow the option of it being bleeped out. But I  really  think we wanna make it the  rare  incidence.	no
24702	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And - and uh, I  am  just a little worried about making it so easy for people to  do,  and so much  fun!	no
24703	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	that they're gonna go through and bleep out stuff.	no
24704	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So much fun.	no
24705	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	"and they can bleep out stuff they don't  like  too, right from somebody else, as you say, you know, so ""well I didn't like what he said."""	no
24706	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Well I don't see  any  way of avoiding that. I mean, we  have  to provi- we have promised that we would provide them the transcript and that they can remove parts that they don't like.	no
24707	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
24708	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So that the -	no
24709	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	No, no, I - I - I don't -	no
24710	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	The  only  question is -	no
24711	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	You- you've talked me into  that,  but I - I just think that we should make it harder to do.	no
24712	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	The problem is if it's harder for them it's also harder for me.	no
24713	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Whereas this web interface, I just get email, it's all formatted, it's all ready to go and I can just insert it.	no
24714	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So maybe you don't give them access to the web interface unless they really need it.	no
24715	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Well I guess -	no
24716	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So - so - so I'm sorry - so -	no
24717	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah. Hmm.	no
24718	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	so -	no
24719	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So maybe this is a s- a way out of it.	no
24720	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	You've provided something that's useful for you to do -	no
24721	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	handle, and useful for someone else if they need it.	no
24722	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	But	no
24723	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Well -	no
24724	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I think the issue of privacy and ease and so forth should be that uh, they get access to this if they really need it.	no
24725	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So you're saying the - the sequence would be more like	no
24726	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	first Adam goes to the contact lists, contacts them via whatever their preferred method is, to see if they  want  to review the meeting.	no
24727	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Right.	no
24728	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And then if they  don't,  you're done. If they  do,  then he provides them access to the - the web site.	no
24729	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Well, to some extent I have to do that  anyway  because as I said we have to distribute  passwords.	no
24730	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	W- w-	no
24731	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Or  - a printed-out form.	no
24732	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	There's - there -	no
24733	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	y-	no
24734	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So,	no
24735	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	but you don't necessarily  have  to distribute passwords is what I'm saying.	no
24736	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Well, but -	no
24737	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So -	no
24738	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	what I'm  saying  is that I can't just email them the password because that's not secure.	no
24739	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Only  if they want it.	no
24740	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	No, no, no. But you aren't necessarily giving them -	no
24741	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So they have to  call  me and ask.	no
24742	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Right.	no
24743	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	But - we don't even necessarily need to end up distributing passwords at  all.	no
24744	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Well, we do because of privacy. We can't just make it openly available on the web.	no
24745	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Mm-hmm.	no
24746	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	No, no. You're missing the point.	no
24747	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	We're - We're trying i-	no
24748	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	We're trying to make it less of an obvious just l- l- l- l-	no
24749	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	uh fall off a log, to  do  this.	no
24750	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Not everyone gets a password,	no
24751	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	unless they ask for it. Yeah.	no
24752	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Right?	no
24753	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	So th- so what  I  would see, is that	no
24754	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	first you contact them and ask them if they would like to review it for to check for the - not just for fun,	no
24755	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	O_K? but to - to check this	no
24756	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	for uh things that they're worried about having said or if they're willing to just send an approval of it, at - from their memory.	no
24757	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Um - and, uh, and we should think carefully actually we should review - go through how that's worded, O_K?	no
24758	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Then, if someone uh - wants to review it,	no
24759	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	uh, and I know you don't like this, but I'm offering this as a suggestion, is that - is that we then give them a print out.	no
24760	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	"And then if they say that ""I have a potential problem with these things,""  then,"	no
24761	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	"you - you say ""O_K well you might wanna hear this in context to s- think if you need that,"" you issue them a password, i- in the -"	no
24762	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	But the - the problem with what you're suggesting is it's not just inconvenient for them, it's inconvenient for me.	no
24763	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Because that means multiple contacts every time - for every single meeting every time anyone wants anything.	no
24764	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I would much  prefer  to have all be automatic, they visit the web site if they  want  to. Obviously they don't have to.	no
24765	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I know you'd  prefer  it, but the proble- we have - there's a  problem  with it.	no
24766	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah. So I think you're thinking people are going to arbitrarily start bleeping and I just don't think that's gonna happen.	no
24767	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I'm also concerned about the spirit of the - of the informed consent thing. Cuz I think if they feel	no
24768	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	that uh, it's - I th- I th- You know, if it turns out that something gets published in this corpus that someone really should have eliminated and didn't detect,	no
24769	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	then it could have been because of their own negligence that they didn't pursue that next level and get the password and do that, um,	no
24770	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	"but - but they might be able to argue ""oh well it was cumbersome, and I was busy and it was gonna take me too much time to trace it down"". So it could that the burden would come back onto us. So I'm a little bit worried about uh, making it harder for them, from the legal standpoint."	no
24771	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Well you can go too far in that direction, and you need to find somewhere between I think, because -	no
24772	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
24773	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	It seems to me that sending them email,	no
24774	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Uh-huh.	no
24775	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	"saying ""if you have an O_- O_K reply to this email and say O_K,"	no
24776	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	"If you have a  problem  with it contact me and I'll give you a password"","	no
24777	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	seems like is a perfectly, reasonable compromise. And if they want a printout they can print it out themselves.	no
24778	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Or we could print it up for  them,   I mean we could offer that - but - but there's uh, another aspect to that and that is that in the informed consent form,	no
24779	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
24780	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	um, my impression is that they - that we offered them at the very least that they definitely  would  have access to the transcript. And - and I ha- I don't know that there's a chance of really skipping that stage.	no
24781	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
24782	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I mean I - I thought that you were - Maybe I misinterpreted what you said but it's -	no
24783	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Having access to it doesn't necessarily mean, that - having it right? It just means they have the  right  to have it.	no
24784	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Having it. Well the in - the consent form is right in there if anyone wants to look at it, so.	no
24785	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Giving it to  them.   O_K.	no
24786	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Alright. Fine. O_K. Fair enough.	no
24787	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah.	no
24788	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Sh- sh- well I could - I'm closer. I could -	no
24789	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	D- you want me to grab one?	no
24790	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah, but you're wired aren't you?	no
24791	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah. That is true.	no
24792	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Um.	no
24793	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Yeah, I mean I don't wanna  fool  them,	no
24794	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I don't know -	no
24795	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	I just meant that e- every - ev- any time you say anything to anyone there is in fact a - a bias that is presented, right? of - and -	no

24820	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Right.	no
24821	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	That - that we really would  rather  it wasn't a patchwork of things tossed out, that it would be better for, um, our, uh, field	no

24825	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Great. Great, great. Yeah. I agree.	no
24826	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	And then - then my concern about - which - you know you might be right, it may be it was just paranoia on my part, uh but people just -	no

24829	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	It's just a check box next to the text, it's not any fun at all.	no
24830	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Well I don't know. I kind of had fun when you played me something that was bleeped out. You know.   I -	no
24831	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	Well, but they won't  get  that feedback.	no
24832	transcript	transcript_Bmr014	All - no because it doesn't automatically bleep it at the  time.  It just sends me -	no

25129	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Pre-crashed.	no
25130	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So it should be a really short meeting, I hope.	yes

25133	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So it should be a really short meeting, I hope.	no
25134	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Uh, agenda items, number one, I wanna talk - since we were just discussing that - is microphone issues. What the heck are we gonna do about microphones?	no
25135	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So uh I got passed on that the E_D_U group doesn't like the	no
25136	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Oh.	no
25137	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	uh, Crown mikes.  I  do. I l- I think - I find them very comfortable. Uh, but it seems to depend on your head shape.	yes
25138	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Oh.	no
25139	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	uh, Crown mikes.  I  do. I l- I think - I find them very comfortable. Uh, but it seems to depend on your head shape.	no
25140	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Who does?	no
25141	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I do.	no
25142	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah, I do too.	no
25143	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So you guys need to start going to the E_D_U meetings.	no
25144	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I see.	no
25145	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah right.	no
25146	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	They don't work for me very well. I much prefer these.	no
25147	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	That's right.	no
25148	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yep. Um,	no
25149	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
25150	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Me too.	no
25151	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So do I.	no
25152	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I  prefer  these, but I don't mind using those.	no
25153	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Right.	no
25154	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Th- those are intimidating.	no
25155	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So apparently they - they like	no
25156	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	It has one good effect, that people are trying to get there early because the people who get there early get to pick the mike.	no
25157	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	O_K.	no
25158	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Interesting.	no
25159	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	People who show up late have to use  these.  So,	no
25160	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	um, we should probably get different mikes. So the question is, the easiest thing to do is certainly to just get two more, um,	no
25161	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Sony  mikes.	no
25162	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Just two more of  those,  um. And that - that's easy and that will certainly work.	no
25163	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	The other option is to try yet another mike.	no
25164	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Find one we like and potentially get  six,  all the  same.	no
25165	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I have a question about this.	no
25166	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Are the auditory quality - Is it, uh, much different between this kind and the - the fancy ones?	no
25167	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Um,  these  are better, if they're worn correctly.	no
25168	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	They are.	no
25169	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	O_K.	no
25170	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Those are better than the Sonys?	no
25171	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Have you -	no
25172	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
25173	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah, definitely.	no
25174	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Have you  listened  to - to  them?	no
25175	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
25176	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah?	no
25177	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
25178	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	O_K.	no
25179	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So, I mean, they're  not  a  lot  better, but they  are  a  little  better.	no
25180	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Are they more directional, the microphones, as far as -	no
25181	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Um, they're more directional, a little better error - uh, noise cancellation, and also you can really get it right in front of your mouth, like this, whereas that one, to avoid breath noise, you really have to put it at - to the side.	no
25182	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	O_K.	no
25183	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So you seem to get better signal with this one.	no
25184	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	The other thing is, is it just a few people who don't like them in the E_D_U group? Cuz -	no
25185	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I don't know, but - you know, in - in sort of random polling	no
25186	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	L- Liz - Liz said something that leaves me believing that  nobody  likes them.	no
25187	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	They are ver-	no
25188	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Gosh, cuz I  much  prefer them, I think they're a whole lot, multiple levels, better.	no
25189	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	It seems a shame t- to discard -  discard  them if - if they're better auditory quality and there're only a few people who dis- who object.	no
25190	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I mean, so s-	no
25191	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Right.	no
25192	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah, that's why I was saying if we could just unplug them and plug them in.	no
25193	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Well, I mean, that's the other option, is that we could switch the form so it's more obvious the distinction between channel and mike, um, and then get	no
25194	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	You know, pretty -	no
25195	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	duplicates. I mean, there's no problem with that. It's just - what -	no
25196	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Hmm.	no
25197	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Should we get just more  Sony  ones? I  hate  the  Sony  ones.	no
25198	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Which ones are those?	no
25199	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	b- the one you're wearing. Because it - it pinches -	no
25200	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	The one I'm wearing? Oh.	no
25201	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Those.	no
25202	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	pinches the  temples  too much.	no
25203	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Oh.	no
25204	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	And -	no
25205	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I mean, so, if you  wear  it sort of around the  back,  it's not  too  bad.	no
25206	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
25207	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I hate it because it's hard to adjust the  microphone.  I mean, I spend all this time fumbling around with it and  still  not	no
25208	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
25209	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	But I -	no
25210	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Right.	no
25211	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	reasonable, yeah.	no
25212	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Right.	no
25213	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So, I mean, we could try another mike.	no
25214	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	But then we have the wiring issue, and -   So I - I don't know  what  to do. What do - what do people think?	no
25215	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	But the problem is again the - the plug, or - ?	no
25216	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Wh-	no
25217	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	The plug is proprietary. So that's why I was saying getting more  Sony  ones is trivial, because we can just go out and buy them. Any other ones we have to buy them in pigtail versions and get them wired.	no
25218	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	O_K.	no
25219	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	O_K.	no
25220	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	O_K.	no
25221	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
25222	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	O_K, n- now may- maybe I just don't know this but, um, are the only two possibilities from  Sony  the two that we've  tried?  Or is there another -	no
25223	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yes.	no
25224	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So, the only possibilities from Sony are  that  one and the lapel mike.	no
25225	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I see. O_K.	no
25226	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	O_K.	no
25227	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Oh, I see.	no
25228	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So this isn't Sony. This is Crown. The one we're wearing.	no
25229	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Isn't that something. O_K.	no
25230	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	And so we had these wired for us.	no
25231	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Oh. I see. O_K.	no
25232	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Well, it s- It seems like right  now  if - if u- what they're complaining are  those,  if we just got two more of  these  -	no
25233	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	And so -	no
25234	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Huh, I remember that now.	no
25235	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I think that's probably the right first step is just get two more immediately, and have them available.	no
25236	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
25237	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	O_K.	no
25238	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	And then they can just unplug those from the -	no
25239	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Right.	no
25240	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	"And just make sure that you write down ""Crown"" or ""Sony"" on the mike number, which I'll change to mike type, or something like that."	no
25241	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	transmitter.	no
25242	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Mm-hmm.	no
25243	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Mm-hmm.	no
25244	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
25245	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	It might be good to double check at the end of the meeting too, cuz that would be an easy place for, uh, an error in the data.	no
25246	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yep.	no
25247	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	For it to be forgotten.	no
25248	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Well, it'll be me -	no
25249	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	It'll be whoever's setting up the meeting, who fills out the key file, so	no
25250	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	O_K, it's just - I'm just thinking that if - it'd be - yeah, but I know - but I mean to have the  user  fill it out wouldn't be as reliable as have the -	no
25251	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	It has the same potential for error as everything else.	no
25252	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	No, no, we definitely would  not  have the user fill it out. It would be me, Chuck, or Liz, depending on which meeting it is.	no
25253	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Good, O_K.	no
25254	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Perfect.	no
25255	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Perfect, O_K.	no
25256	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	O_K, so we'll de- definitely go ahead and do that.	no
25257	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	How much is it just to buy the mike?	no
25258	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Couple hundred.	no
25259	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Really.	no
25260	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
25261	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Is that more or less than you thought?	no
25262	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	It depends on how good the mike is.	no
25263	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Oh that's  way  more than I thought. I - yeah.	no
25264	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Oh, O_K.	no
25265	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
25266	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	For one of  these?	no
25267	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Well the  Crown  ones were like two-fifty. I think  those  are like one-ninety.	no
25268	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	God.	no
25269	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Oops.	no
25270	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Wow!	no
25271	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	But.	no
25272	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Is there any educational discount?	no
25273	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah right.	no
25274	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	No.	no
25275	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Student discount.	no
25276	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah, good mikes are expensive. So.	no
25277	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	And when I was at Computer Motion we used Shure, the S_M-ten-A's, and I  think  they were only like eighty  bucks  or something.	no
25278	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Mm-hmm.	no
25279	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah, eighty or ninety for the Shures. So.	no
25280	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah. But they were - they seemed pretty good.	no
25281	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I mean, the  Sony  ones are expensive because they're proprietary, so they can charge whatever they want. These are expensive because they're quite high quality. So.	no
25282	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Oh.	no
25283	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Right, right.	no
25284	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So we should buzz  that out if we send the data to Sony.	no
25285	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Ah, come on.	no
25286	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	We should keep a list of things we're gonna bleep out and the conditions under which -	no
25287	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Well, I'm just joking.	no
25288	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So, you do  not  have to bleep that out. I don't mind if Sony knows my opinion. So.	no
25289	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Hmm.	no
25290	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Um.	no
25291	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Also, we're pro- I wanna double check with Morgan, he  did  say yes  before  I went to Japan on buying another wireless system so that we can go all wireless, instead of the mix of wired and wireless. And I think that's the right thing to do.	no
25292	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So then all those red channels there would become wireless ones?	no
25293	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	And I'm -	no
25294	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
25295	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yep.	no
25296	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Cool.	no
25297	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yep.	no
25298	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Uh-huh.	no
25299	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Four more wireless.	no
25300	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Um.	no
25301	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	And also I'm gonna re-  probably  replace the Andrea mike with a Shure, but I'll test it, uh, sometime today or tomorrow to make sure the Shure one really works, cuz I have an extra Shure in my office.	no
25302	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	The Andrea mike?	no
25303	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
25304	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah, apparently it's had some problems.	no
25305	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	That's causing problems, yeah.	no
25306	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Which one is the Andrea mike?	no
25307	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	It was over here sometimes.	no
25308	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	A wired one?	no
25309	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	The - yeah a wired one.	no
25310	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah. It's uh -	no
25311	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Well, if you're gonna go to all wireless,	no
25312	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Oh, you mean in the meantime.	no
25313	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	This one.	no
25314	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	In the meantime, right, because uh -	no
25315	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Ah, I see.	no
25316	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
25317	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	it'll - it'll probably take a couple weeks to get it delivered from Sony anyway.	no
25318	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
25319	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I haven't - In the meetings that I recorded s-	no
25320	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So -	no
25321	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	It's always been at most six people, so I've never had to -	no
25322	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Oh really? Yeah.	no
25323	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Recently I haven't had to used any of the wired ones at all.	no
25324	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I guess cuz everyone's been out of town. Probably over the summer it'll be the same cuz it tends to be less,	no
25325	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
25326	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	fewer people.	no
25327	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Um,	no
25328	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	File -	no
25329	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Uh, done with microphone issues, I think?	no
25330	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Should we close the door?	no
25331	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	If you want.	no
25332	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Oh, I'm thinking - I don't know about the acoustics. That's - that's all I was wondering about.	no
25333	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	And this way we can get a door-slam in the uh - in the transcript file.	no
25334	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
25335	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah that's right, we gotta get the obligatory door-slam.	no
25336	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Oh well. No- not quite a slam.	no
25337	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	There's some knocks.	no
25338	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Get a special phone for that.	no
25339	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Mm-hmm.	no
25340	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Uh, the door-slam phone?	no
25341	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I guess, right, the door-slam phone.	no
25342	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
25343	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	You have a special phone?	no
25344	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	No, we could add one.	no
25345	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Oh, we could add one, yeah.	no
25346	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	And then we could have the  phone  phone,	no
25347	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
25348	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	That's an idea.	no
25349	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	for - for when the phone rings.	no
25350	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Um,	yes
25351	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	That's an idea.	no
25352	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Um,	no
25353	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Uh, file reorganization.	no
25354	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	This is something we were talking about  before  I left and saying we should probably wait until  after  I'm  back,  and now I'm back, so, we should do that at some point. So we should	no
25355	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	get ourselves a list of everything we wanna do to reorganize the file structure and anything else.	no
25356	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Can I - can I just mention something?	no
25357	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Sure.	no
25358	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Um, uh, I think the file regards reorganization. Also, um, another issue there is disk space probably, right? Um, so	no
25359	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Mm-hmm.	no
25360	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I know that the files that you've been cutting up for us	no
25361	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	f- for the recognition experiments, uh, one way - one really	no
25362	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Mm-hmm.	no
25363	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	brain -	no
25364	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	uh, brain-dead way of - of - of	no
25365	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	not causing any trouble, but saving disk space is to, uh, use the s- the	no
25366	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Sphere, the NIST, uh, W_encode program.	no
25367	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	to - to encode, you know, to compress them.	no
25368	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Shorten. Is that the same as shorten?	no
25369	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Uh, yeah, but it does it s- it happens so that the program that reads the waveforms does the unshortening transparently.	no
25370	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
25371	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Well, O_K, you mean it's built into the S_R_I, because we have the same thing with shorten in the  sound  tools.	no
25372	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So.	no
25373	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Y- uh, I  guess,  but it	no
25374	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	um,	no
25375	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So it's just a question of - of what decompression is built into your tools.	no
25376	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Well, it's -	no
25377	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Well like - Hhh.	no
25378	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	It's actually built into the Sphere library that NIST delivers, so - Right.	no
25379	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Oh really? I didn't know that.	no
25380	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	And actually, s- the sound tools  don't  understand that.	no
25381	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	For the -	no
25382	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	At least Feacalc doesn't.	no
25383	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	At least  Feacalc  doesn't. So.	no
25384	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Well, that's not a sound tool, right.	no
25385	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	But since - since these files are made to be used with the S_R_I recognizer,	no
25386	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	uh and the S_R_I front-end uses the Sphere library which in turn does this	no
25387	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	transparently	no
25388	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	um,	no
25389	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	uh, that will be a quick and -	no
25390	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	quick and easy way to just, uh, get you know, uh, be able to use more -	no
25391	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
25392	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Mm-hmm.	no
25393	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	The other thing I could do to relieve some of the pressure um is just move everything	no
25394	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	to my eighteen gig  disk,  which is local.	no
25395	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	But that's gonna be only  temporary.	no
25396	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Well,	no
25397	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I mean, I don't know -	no
25398	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I mean, you should do that too,	no
25399	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	probably, but - but as you do that you can also just run the -	no
25400	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah, it is kind of a temporary solution.	no
25401	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	To shorten everything.	no
25402	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	well, actually, the - th- what you do is you run -	no
25403	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Oh, now I have another use for the -	no
25404	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	The way I recently used it, and there might be better ways - So the program's called W_encode.	no
25405	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Mmm.	no
25406	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	And I think the type, y- you say um	no
25407	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I think dash T_ and then there are different -	no
25408	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	"different encoding methods, but if you wanna use the shorten one, you say d- ""minus T_ shorten"","	no
25409	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	and then the old	no
25410	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	uh wavefile and the  new	no
25411	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	wavefile, and then - Oops!  And then I check, you know, if this works, so, you can use the -	no
25412	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	"the shell ""AND"" operator or something."	no
25413	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Then I just move the	no
25414	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	new wavefile to the,	no
25415	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	you know, to the old	no
25416	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Right.	no
25417	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	wavefile, and then you have replaced the old one with one that behaves identically as long as your programs that use it know how to	no
25418	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Mm-hmm.	no
25419	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	decode it on the fly.	no
25420	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	And that -	no
25421	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	O_K.	no
25422	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	that just saved my butt because I actually was running - On a different experiment, I had	no
25423	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	segmented -	no
25424	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I was processing the whole Switchboard-two corpus, which is two hundred eighty hours of speech,	no
25425	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	and I was noticing, as I was	no
25426	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	almost finishing the processing, that I was running out of disk space.	no
25427	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Mm-hmm.	no
25428	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	And - and so	no
25429	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I uh had this flash of inspiration of just uh the same - the same disk had the segmented waveforms on them, so I -	no
25430	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Shortening everything on the fly.	no
25431	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	while this other thing was still going  on,  I was run- I was running this -  this  thing.	no
25432	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	You had another process running that was shortening it. Yep.	no
25433	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Wow, wow!	no
25434	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	And low and behold I gained three g- three gig of space and um, you know -	no
25435	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Wow!	no
25436	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	"Did you have to re-nice one of the processes to make sure that ""shorten""?"	no
25437	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	No, no.  Actually it was fast enough. This is very fast. This - this really runs quickly. And that's -	no
25438	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Wow.	no
25439	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	That must have been suspenseful.	no
25440	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Watching the disk meter.	no
25441	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	That was  very   suspenseful.  That was - that was the most excitement I had all weekend. Uh, uh boy, it uh  came out just fine. So.	no
25442	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	To be O_K.	no
25443	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	You know what would be a -	no
25444	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	u- I don't know if this would mess other things up, but -	no
25445	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	It seems like kind of a pain to have all these split up files around. What would be easier would be like pointers.	no
25446	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	The list, yep.	no
25447	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	"You know, lists like ""original wavefile, start, end""."	no
25448	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Start end.	no
25449	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	This is -	no
25450	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yep, the way  Feacalc   - calc does it.	no
25451	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Right, the - the only reason we do this is because the - the S_R_I front-end doesn't have a way to - to um	no
25452	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	go into a l- a longer file with indices.	no
25453	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Um, so I - I suppose	no
25454	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	And segment on the fly.	no
25455	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	someone could try to put a hack like that into the -	no
25456	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	It would be easy.	no
25457	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	It wouldn't be hard at all. Someone just needs to d- sit down and do it who has some time.	no
25458	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So.	no
25459	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	But there's also some - I guess -	no
25460	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	And that way we wouldn't have multiple versions floating around. About the only difficulty with that is if it's  compressed.	no
25461	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Then you really  do  have to decompress it  first.	no
25462	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	That's true.	no
25463	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Right? Because the pointers are -	no
25464	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Y- you don't know how much it's comp-	no
25465	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Well, is there - is there - is there a NIST routine which	no
25466	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	It doesn't compress it by a fixed amount.	no
25467	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Exactly. Right right right right right.	no
25468	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	can seek	no
25469	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	in a compressed file but with uncompressed indices?	no
25470	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I don't think so.	no
25471	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	And  yeah I mean, that - it -	no
25472	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	No, no. I mean, if you -	no
25473	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Th- the - the - the -	no
25474	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	If you can operate on the full -	no
25475	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	If you  don't  have to  segment  it, then there would be less of a reason to do the  compression,  because you don't have that wasted -	no
25476	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Right.	no
25477	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	that extra  copy.  So.	no
25478	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Right we - I mean the original  Switchboard  files are not compressed, right? So we could leave those as they  are.	no
25479	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
25480	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Right.	no
25481	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Well, I mean, it just depends on how much disk space is a problem. I mean the - what you could do is decompress it to a temporary place and then operate on it and then delete it.	no
25482	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Right.	no
25483	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	But.	no
25484	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I mean, the segmentation also  saves  you space in the sense that you cut out all the  nonspeech  regions.	no
25485	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Just silences, yeah.	no
25486	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	And if you have, you know, twenty channels and only five speakers, then it's -	no
25487	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	That's true.	no
25488	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Mm-hmm.	no
25489	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Well, assuming you'd - Yeah. Assuming that you then off-load the original	no
25490	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
25491	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Switchboard files.	no
25492	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So.	no
25493	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Mmm.	no
25494	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
25495	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Well, it seems like just shortening them is a good short-term solution so we don't have to do any coding.	no
25496	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah, yeah.	no
25497	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
25498	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	But I think - kind of - We've had - There was a big disk crash when you were gone and -	no
25499	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So.	no
25500	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	No, it was - I was still here. It was the day I left.	no
25501	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Oh was that the day you left?	no
25502	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	That's suspicious.	no
25503	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	He did it on purpose.	no
25504	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
25505	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Leave to Japan the day the disk crashes.	no
25506	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	No if I - if I had done it on purpose I would have timed it right  after  I left.	no
25507	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	But, um - Yeah so, Chuck helped me out in, uh, r-	no
25508	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	regenerating all the cha- the different channel files for like a few meetings - for like six meetings. So I think they're split up even further. It's kind of even more disorganized now since	no
25509	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Mm-hmm.	no
25510	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	we moved some of the meetings to different directories.	no
25511	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	They're on a different disk even, right?	no
25512	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Are they?	no
25513	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I think - you - didn't you expand them to X_E on Abbott?	no
25514	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	X_F.	no
25515	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	No, you - the ones that	no
25516	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Oh, different ones?	no
25517	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	You - the ones that you put them on when you put them on X_E.	no
25518	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I don't remember where I put them now.	no
25519	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I think you put them on X_E. So.	no
25520	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	O_K.	no
25521	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Well what we - what we found out was that um the disk that crashed	no
25522	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	was - it - w- with a - with a meta disk allocation, you had both c- t- transcripts and the shortened files and the expanded files were all on X_E - were on the same - sorry, different partitions of the same physical disk.	no
25523	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Physical disk.	no
25524	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Mmm.	no
25525	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	And it's conceivable I mean, I - I don't - I mean, so um, I was told that it's  possible  that that might have, uh, caused additional wear on it. Maybe caused it to - to go bad sooner.	no
25526	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Well, I think there was something else going on, because uh Dave Johnson said that D_D was getting accessed  frequently.  And it  shouldn't  be.	no
25527	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Hmm.	no
25528	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Oh. Uh-huh.	no
25529	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Right? That data never gets touched, because we write it once and then we never touch it again.	no
25530	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Well, why not?	no
25531	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Oh sure it does.	no
25532	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah, after each meeting we copy the data to -	no
25533	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Except that -	no
25534	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Well, I mean, so the wavefiles, or - or anything at all, because the transcripts are there as well.	no
25535	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	The wave files.	no
25536	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I mean, he was saying gigabytes.	no
25537	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Oh, gigabytes. I see.	no
25538	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	And so, it has to be the wave files.	no
25539	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah, there  was  something weird about that.	no
25540	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah, that's right.	no
25541	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah, so I asked Dave about it and he hasn't looked into it yet, but we should definitely double check on it.	no
25542	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah like - like the same	no
25543	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	meeting - shortened, files that we pull off of Popcorn when we're done doing the recording,	no
25544	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
25545	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	looked,	no
25546	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	to the  backup  software, as if they had been written,	no
25547	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	you know, every single  night,	no
25548	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Every night.	no
25549	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Is that right.	no
25550	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	i- for - f- you know, a week in a  row,  which is really weird.	no
25551	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	That's  very  strange. I didn't realize that. O_K.	no
25552	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Wow.	no
25553	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So at any rate, so for file reorganization we need to  first  decide what we're gonna do and then when we're gonna do it.	no
25554	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
25555	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So I'm not sure who isn't involved with that. I mean, certainly me, Chuck and Jane. Anyone else  care?	no
25556	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	And I - and I'd like, in terms of the conventions, to also, uh, you know, s- send a bit to Dan Ellis to see if it's - if there's any - get his input on it. I don't think - I don't think that'll be - Yeah.	no
25557	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	No.	no
25558	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Right.	no
25559	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So, maybe we should do that	no
25560	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
25561	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	not  during this meeting but s- another time, and just get a list of everything we're gonna do.	no
25562	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
25563	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
25564	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
25565	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Maybe n- next week if we  could.  I'm trying to finish up some stuff.	no
25566	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	O_K.	no
25567	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah sure. I'd like to -	no
25568	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So just update all the naming conventions and	no
25569	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	put all the files where they really belong, on one disk,	no
25570	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	That sounds like a good idea.	no
25571	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	and then leave - leave everything in place until the back-up - until the next full back-up and then delete the old ones.	no
25572	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Mm-hmm.	no
25573	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	O_K, now - and you're just - you're not talking about the s- the X_ disks - the X_ uh partitions, just the backed up space, or - ?	no
25574	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So.	no
25575	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Well,  both  need to be reorganized.	no
25576	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	O_K.	no
25577	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So um,	no
25578	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	various paths, th- I mean this is why we have to do it in a synchronized way, because um	no
25579	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I think we should also at the same time try to, uh, convert over to your new naming conventions.	no
25580	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yes,	no
25581	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	exactly. That too.	no
25582	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	That'd be good.	no
25583	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So that's what I was saying. We need to get a list of all that stuff that we wanna do.	no
25584	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
25585	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	O_K.	no
25586	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	And so	no
25587	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I didn't really get any responses from the naming conventions that I sent out, so I assume that's alright with everyone.	no
25588	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I actually haven't looked at it yet. I haven't had a chance, so.	no
25589	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	No.	no
25590	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Hmm.	no
25591	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I haven't either. Sorry.	no
25592	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Oh.	no
25593	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	And -	no
25594	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I will by next  week,  though.	no
25595	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Uh, I don't know about the naming, I mean,	no
25596	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	O_K.	yes
25597	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I will by next  week,  though.	no
25598	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Uh, I don't know about the naming, I mean,	no
25599	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	O_K.	no
25600	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Then I should have made that as an agenda item.	no
25601	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Th- so these names that we've been using so far are with uh	no
25602	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	uh	no
25603	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	uh	no
25604	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I wouldn't just wanna change them	no
25605	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	you know, without some advance notice.	no
25606	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Right.	no
25607	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I mean, th- that's all these  segment  names that we- we've been using. I would rather not mess with them	no
25608	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
25609	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah, I'm -	no
25610	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	until we have some closure on some of the things we are currently	no
25611	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Right.	no
25612	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	dealing with, so -	no
25613	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Well, I mean, how  you  choose to do it - the naming is up to you.	no
25614	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Right.	no
25615	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Well,	no
25616	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So.	no
25617	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	You're talking about different files.	no
25618	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I mean, it should probably be -  eventually  should probably be consistent with what you're doing but,	no
25619	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yep.	no
25620	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	yeah, I kind of agree with Andreas, like I'm a little bit -	no
25621	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I mean, these -	no
25622	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I  looked  at the naming conventions and they look fine to me, but at the same time it was just like you know to rename everything would be -	no
25623	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Well, if we -	no
25624	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	If  we  change things, it won't really affect what  you're  doing, will it?	no
25625	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	This -	no
25626	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	No but I think just to be consistent we should also, I mean, have the same conventions, just in case you want -	no
25627	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Right.	no
25628	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah. So you - but you can switch that any time you want, right?	no
25629	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's only gonna affect my work. So.	no
25630	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah, it's not gonna -	no
25631	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I mean, if we -	no
25632	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I assume you're not gonna go, like, into, you know,  my  directories and change  my  file names. So. Yeah.	no
25633	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Everybody will use it.  Fine slash U_ slash star.	no
25634	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Right.	no
25635	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I - Actually I was gonna do a global search-replace on all entries at -	no
25636	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	at ICSI to change M_R to M_R_M at all places at ICSI.	no
25637	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah, that'd be great.	no
25638	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Really enjoy that.	no
25639	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	With no - with no advance warning.	no
25640	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Y- you -	no
25641	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Well, maybe I shouldn't say that on re- record.	no
25642	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	O_K.	no
25643	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	There was a	no
25644	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	typo in some of the contracts that Morgan got that someone,	no
25645	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	"one of our sponsors, did a global sear- search and replace for - between ""sponsor"" and  their  name."	no
25646	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Mm-hmm.	no
25647	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Oh no, oh no.	no
25648	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	And so, it - it was saying, uh -	no
25649	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Well, anyway, I won't -	no
25650	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah, one - one can imagine that that might be problematic.	no
25651	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I'm not sure whether that's right.	no
25652	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah, one can imagine the problems that that would  engender.	no
25653	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	But this - this name change affects a subset, doesn't need to reflect everything, yeah.	no
25654	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So.	no
25655	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Right.	no
25656	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Right.	no
25657	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Um,	no
25658	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Thilo, you had - you wanted to talk about the -	yes
25659	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Thilo, you had - you wanted to talk about the -	no
25660	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah, I had one - one short point. I have just installed a Transcriber version on one of our N_T machines so it's available under Windows now.	no
25661	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Oh great. Actually someone - I just got an email this week from someone as-	no
25662	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Isn't that great?	no
25663	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah I re- responded to sh- I have already responded to him. I - I don't know what - what - what he - what the problem was. It was really straightforward, really easy.	no
25664	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	To Anant?	no
25665	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	And this is not - Mm-hmm.	no
25666	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Oh, I'm sorry, I - I just - So, who did you talk to?	no
25667	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	There was some - some guy from S_R_I who wanted to - to install - Yeah.	no
25668	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Anant?	no
25669	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Anant Venkataraman? O_K.	no
25670	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
25671	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	And he sent an email that he couldn't - couldn't install it and I - I just described him, well, what I did and it was really straightforward, so.	no
25672	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah, O_K. Great.	no
25673	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah, O_K.	no
25674	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Great. Great. Thanks. Thanks.	no
25675	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	And this is not just the Transcriber, this is the Channeltrans, right?	no
25676	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah, it's the Channeltrans, so the -	no
25677	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
25678	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah, excellent.	no
25679	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	the	no
25680	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Cool.	no
25681	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	things that Dave Gelbart -	no
25682	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Excellent.	no
25683	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So you should probably talk to a Sys Admin and get it put in some central place.	no
25684	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So that it'll work on all the N_T machines.	no
25685	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Well, I mean, as it stands, I - I guess - yeah I see what you mean. It'll - it'll be on the - on the UNIX side but accessible through the H_drive. Yeah.	no
25686	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	O_K.	no
25687	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I've -	no
25688	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Right.	no
25689	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	O_K. Yeah. I could do that.	no
25690	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So I assume Tcl-T_K wasn't already on the machine, so you had to install it. Yeah.	no
25691	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I had i- to install it, yeah.	no
25692	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Huh. Yeah.	no
25693	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Uh	no
25694	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So Andreas, would it be appropriate to ask how the experiments are going?	yes
25695	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Huh. Yeah.	no
25696	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So Andreas, would it be appropriate to ask how the experiments are going?	no
25697	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Uh -	no
25698	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Oh, well, yeah I - I - I actually wasn't sure whether this is the right meeting for it, because it has uh very little to do with - with  meeting  recordings, but	no
25699	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Hmm.	no
25700	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	@@   you know, I did uh run	no
25701	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	um some recognition experiments with ICSI  front-end.	no
25702	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Um	no
25703	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Uh, and - and you know, this is the j- joint work with Chuck, and uh,	no
25704	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	um.	no
25705	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So, first,	no
25706	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	uh, you know, we had -	no
25707	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	we figured out sometime last week how to	no
25708	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	um -	no
25709	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	and - and Chuck wrote this really nice little	no
25710	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	script - Perl script that	no
25711	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	takes a uh waveform, runs the feature calculation	no
25712	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	and then dumps it out into the - into um	no
25713	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	a f- c- so-called	no
25714	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	uh cepstra file, which is what the S_R_I system uses to read features. It's essentially uh	no
25715	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	uh NIST headered	no
25716	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	uh waveform. You know, it looks like a waveform except instead of samples you have  feature  vectors following the header.	no
25717	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Hmm.	no
25718	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Mm-hmm.	no
25719	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	And um that's all done	no
25720	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	um	no
25721	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	by the script, and it works great. And	no
25722	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	uh I first trained up two	no
25723	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	systems, because it's gender-dep- you know, the S_R_I system is gender-dependent so to be comparable, I trained uh um on a sh- on a so-called short training set	no
25724	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	um	no
25725	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	a male system and a female system,	no
25726	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	and	no
25727	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	uh also for debugging purposes, and for the heck of it, I trained um -	no
25728	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	trained uh on the same training set uh a standard system with the  S_R_I  front-end from  scratch,	no
25729	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	um, and compared the two -	no
25730	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So, w- what features did you use?	no
25731	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Well, we used, uh, twelve P_L_P uh, uh -	no
25732	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So not RASTA, just P_L_P.	no
25733	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Just P_L_P.	no
25734	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Just P_L_P and actually that - uh, one of the questions I had was what the RASTA would possibly buy us. But um, we'll	no
25735	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	talk about that later. So, the uh - so the baseline system - w- the S_R_I system was - uh used - uh also uh uh used t- twelve uh mel - uh mel cepstra	no
25736	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	um  based on a twenty-four filter bank	no
25737	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	um analysis.	no
25738	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Um	no
25739	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I do  not	no
25740	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	know what - So the f- the bandwidth of the um	no
25741	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	S_R_I  front-end is from hundreds hertz to th- th- thirty-se- thirty-seven fifty or something like that.	no
25742	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Thirty-seven fifty.	no
25743	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	And I do not know what the um	no
25744	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	ICSI um	no
25745	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	front-end would do. I mean, what the bandwidth is.	no
25746	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Um,	no
25747	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	but the results are such that uh, let's see -	no
25748	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	There's one other slight difference, right? Or two -  two  differences.	no
25749	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Oh yeah. So the S_R_I system also does um	no
25750	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	vocal tract length normalization and we couldn't figure out how to do that yet with the ICSI features. So that's one difference. And the other difference is that	no
25751	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	in the, uh -	no
25752	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	in the S_R_I system,	no
25753	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	the uh th- the first - the C_zero, the energy uh feature is normalized slightly differently from the rest. And what they do is	no
25754	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Huh.	no
25755	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	they d- they subtract the maximum -	no
25756	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	For each waveform segment	no
25757	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	they subtract the maximum of - of th- over that waveform segment from	no
25758	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	from the values of - for that waveform.	no
25759	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Which is a kind of automatic gain control, that is localized -	no
25760	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Do they subtract the max from each i- one or do they subtract each one from the max?	no
25761	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Who cares?	no
25762	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	They subtract -	no
25763	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Doesn't matter?	no
25764	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	No, just would be a sign change.	no
25765	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Except you get a lot of negatives the other way.	no
25766	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Right,  right, right. Um, and  then,  after - But after they done this waveform based normalization, they  then  do a  conversation  length normalization just like all the other features.	no
25767	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So it's their kind of two stage normalization.	no
25768	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Oh!	no
25769	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Oh!	no
25770	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Um now, I understand that the common practice  here  has been to just do c- standard uh mean subtraction, um on the waveform.	no
25771	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Um.	no
25772	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	For the C_zero.	no
25773	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Right. But in what  we've  done so far, because we didn't have any special provision for  C_zero , we just treat it as - as any of the  other  features, we've done standard mean subtraction over the whole	no
25774	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	conversation side.	no
25775	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So	no
25776	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	um since both S_R_I and ICSI use this sort of local normalization for C_zero that's presumably, you know, someone has done some experiments to - and found out that that works better.	no
25777	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Um, so that's another difference, and that might account for some of the	no
25778	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	discrepancies in the results. Um, but you know. So the	no
25779	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	the  results  are	no
25780	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	um	no
25781	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Where should I start? Uh	no
25782	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	the -	no
25783	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So there's a two -	no
25784	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Oh. I tried it  with  and  without.  Uh.	no
25785	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So  without	no
25786	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	and with  adaptation.	no
25787	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	How many iterations?	no
25788	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	For the adaptation?	no
25789	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Mm-hmm.	no
25790	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Well, y- we always do three E_M iterations to	no
25791	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	O_K.	no
25792	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	and it's - it's this - it's this quick and dirty -	no
25793	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	the  phone  loop adaptation which doesn't actually require prior recognition paths and - and so this is not the best you can  do  with adaptation, but it gives you sort of a first	no
25794	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	idea of what you could gain with it.	no
25795	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	And then, you know, so we have the	no
25796	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	the S_R_I front-end	no
25797	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	and the ICSI front-end	no
25798	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	and other than that the system configuration was identical. So it was the same -	no
25799	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	They came up with um	no
25800	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	you know, same number of uh Gaussians per state cluster	no
25801	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Um, same - The clustering used the same information loss threshold, which actually led to roughly the same number of Gaussians overall. So that the system configuration is - is comparable.	no
25802	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Um, and the -	no
25803	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Uh, so  without  adaptation,	no
25804	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	you had forty-nine p-	no
25805	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	That's error rate or recognition rate?	no
25806	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	This is error rate	no
25807	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	in percent.	no
25808	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	And	no
25809	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	with adaptation	no
25810	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	it's forty-seven point one	no
25811	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	and	no
25812	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	this - this was fifty-two point six.	no
25813	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	and	no
25814	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	fifty-one point three	no
25815	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Hmm.	no
25816	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	and then, when I combined them - I can actually combine them with	no
25817	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	something like ROVER. It's actually more sophisticated than ROVER but it's -	no
25818	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Um, here I got	no
25819	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	forty-eight point five	no
25820	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	and here I got forty-six point five.	no
25821	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So this is just combination at the utterance level.	no
25822	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Um.	no
25823	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	At the utterance level, right.	no
25824	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Why do you think the ICSI front-end is so much  worse?	no
25825	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Good  question.    That's fine .	no
25826	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	That seems really odd to me.	no
25827	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Um, so, one percent I would attribute to the lack of V_T_L, about one percent. O_K.	no
25828	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Oh right. Right, right, right.	no
25829	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	O_K. Ah O_K.	no
25830	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	And then maybe another up - I don't know how much the C_zero normalization business really matters I can't it see, I mean can't see it - the  @@	no
25831	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Ca- can you run the S_R_I - Just as an experiment, run the S_R_I front-end without vocal tract norma- normalization, and see how much difference it makes?	no
25832	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I  could.  Yeah.	no
25833	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I could certainly do that. Yeah.	no
25834	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Um.	no
25835	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	We could  also  do the vocal tract length normalization with the  ICSI  features. That's something we wanted to do - yeah. We could - I was actually thinking we could use the warping factors that we compute for the M_F_C_C's	no
25836	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
25837	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	If we could figure out how.	no
25838	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
25839	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	and just try them with the ICSI	no
25840	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	uh front-end. Because we already have the capability to apply the warping to the um -	no
25841	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	to the P_L_P c-  uh Dan added the  -	no
25842	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah, Dan added that in, but -	no
25843	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah, but the -	no
25844	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So.	no
25845	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	They won't -	no
25846	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	they don't correspond one-to- one  though.	no
25847	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	No, but they  should  be	no
25848	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	close,  since this -	no
25849	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I mean the -	no
25850	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Anyway. But I can certainly try the S_R_I front-end without uh V_T_L. That sh- that's - that's certainly quick to do.	no
25851	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
25852	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Um	no
25853	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	and so -	no
25854	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah, and - and then there's all these um -	no
25855	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	You know, the number of um -	no
25856	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	You know, this  front-end	no
25857	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	u- had a fair amount of experimentation going into it. You know, how many	no
25858	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Mm-hmm.	no
25859	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	filter banks do you use, what - what bandwidth do you use, and stuff like that. And uh we could play the same kind of games with the  ICSI  front-end.	no
25860	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Right.	no
25861	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Uh, actually, the  analysis  bandwidth played a very crucial role. We used to use a narrow bandwidth and	no
25862	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	uh	no
25863	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	uh that hurt us. So this is, um - And this is - We've now used roughly what everybody else is using. So	no
25864	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Hmm.	no
25865	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	um, there's some room for improvements, I figure, in this - in the ICSI front-end.	no
25866	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Um.	no
25867	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So.	no
25868	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	But the good news is that even with this - with the ICSI system being that much  worse,  you still get a win out of  combining  the two.	no
25869	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So that gives some hope for the future.	no
25870	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Um.	no
25871	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Unfortunately however this seems to be reduced with adaptation, so.	no
25872	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Um.	no
25873	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Also interestingly	no
25874	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	the -	no
25875	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Um, the difference actually  widens.  I would actually expect it or - or  hope  that the adaptation  reduces  the difference  because it might	no
25876	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	um, for instance,	no
25877	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	um	no
25878	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	remove some of the um -	no
25879	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	You know, som- If you - if you have some - some difference in the front-end processing that	no
25880	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	uh is suboptimal, but can be possibly remedied by you know moving the	no
25881	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	um	no
25882	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	moving the models around. But - but apparently that doesn't -	no
25883	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	doesn't really - actually the difference becomes larger, so.	no
25884	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Um. Anyway. So right now what I'm doing is um -	no
25885	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Uh well, there's several things going on. One is that Chuck is working on uh getting the tandem features um into a form that we can train the tandem - the system on the tandem features. So that would actually be the	no
25886	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	more  interesting  experiment.	no
25887	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Um, the other thing is I'm training	no
25888	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	uh retraining the models on the large training set that we usually use to build our evaluation models and then we can -	no
25889	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Right.	no
25890	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	And I actually  want  to	no
25891	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	do the  system  combination	no
25892	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	um  with  our  eval  system um, on some subset of the data at least, probably only for the males, because I don't have time to train both males and females, but um.	no
25893	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Uh and um -	no
25894	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	What about ta-	no
25895	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	concatenating the two feature vectors into a single one?	no
25896	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	It gets pretty big.	no
25897	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	It  does  get pretty big. Yeah.	no
25898	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Hmm.	no
25899	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	And m- my experience with that in Broadcast News was usually combining at other levels works better.	no
25900	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Hmm.	no
25901	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So.	no
25902	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	For - for whatever that's worth.	no
25903	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Oh, you tried that on Broadcast News? Concatenating	no
25904	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Oh yeah.	no
25905	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	no
25906	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So w- Yep.	no
25907	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	different feature sets? Yeah.	no
25908	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Did you try uh -	no
25909	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	It was mostly M_S_G, P_L_P, RASTA.	no
25910	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I see.	no
25911	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So, you know, the feature sets we had available. And it was almost always better to combine at the probability level. You know, so we'd run the neural nets and combine the probabilities.	no
25912	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I see.	no
25913	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	O_K.	no
25914	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Alright.	no
25915	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Oh.	no
25916	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah, and it  does  become sort of unwieldy to have these very large feature vectors. And that would	no
25917	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yep.	no
25918	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	blow up the	no
25919	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	You'd also have to do some sort of normalization afterwards	no
25920	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	uh -	no
25921	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	so that they're uh orthogonal.	no
25922	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Right.	no
25923	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So you'd wanna do a linear transform also.	no
25924	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Right.	no
25925	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Um	no
25926	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	so	no
25927	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	the - Yeah, and then we could start experimenting a little bit to try to get the ICSI front-end to perform better.	no
25928	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Um. And - and as a preliminary just sort of diagnostic experiment we can - I can certainly run a S_R_I system without V_T_L	no
25929	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yep.	no
25930	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	just uh to get -	no
25931	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Wi- without what? Without V_T_L. O_K.	no
25932	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Just -	no
25933	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Vocal tract thing, yeah.	no
25934	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Wh- Yeah.	no
25935	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	And that - that's quick to do.	no
25936	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So.	no
25937	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I was thinking about	no
25938	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	tandem system - Well, let's not talk about it here, but I had some thoughts about the tandem system.	no
25939	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	yeah so but things are moving ahead, so	no
25940	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	O_K, should we do digits?	no
25941	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Digits. Sure.	yes
25942	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Digits. Sure.	no
25943	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Do we have any other topics?	no
25944	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	O_K, let's do them one at a  time  instead of simultaneous since we actually have time.	no
25945	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Poetic reading of digits.	no

26010	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	You can really tell from the prosody where it goes.	yes
26011	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	You can really tell from the prosody where it goes.	no
26012	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	s- meeting. I actually have one more thing that - I don't know if it's - i- if - if it's allowed to - to bring up after the dis-	no
26013	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	After digits, I don't know.	no
26014	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Anyway.	no
26015	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	But it might be important. For um - So Liz remarked that she had recorded a meeting where	no
26016	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Go ahead.	no
26017	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	it was later found that several of the	no
26018	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	s- microphones were turned off, um	no
26019	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Mm-hmm.	no
26020	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	and this must become a problem especially with non-speech-meetings.	no
26021	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	So um	no
26022	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	is there a way that the software could warn you if it gets zeros from	no
26023	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	some of the channels, or - ?	no
26024	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Probably. We could probably build that in to the front-end.	no
26025	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Because it - you know it's really annoying if you go through all that trouble and then basically the meetings aren't useable because uh even -	no
26026	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	What are people doing, they're switching their mikes off or something?	no
26027	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	"I don't  know  what they do. Maybe the batteries went dead, or th- they just didn't - they played with the thing and it didn't leave it in the ""on"" position or whatever."	no
26028	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I don't know, uh eh. Fff.	no
26029	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	What would you like it to  do  when that happens?	no
26030	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Well, no, if - if you um - I mean obviously you always -	no
26031	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I mean, there's never gonna be a signal from all the channels, right? because - or  rarely.	no
26032	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Um.	no
26033	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	But uh.	no
26034	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Well if an unblacked out channel is zero, is actually spitting out zeros, you can be pretty sure it's  off.	no
26035	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Right.	no
26036	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Because it doesn't spit out zeros, it spits out epsilons.	no
26037	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Right? Cuz there's little background noise. The question is, when the software  detects  it, what do you want it to  do?	no
26038	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Exactly.	no
26039	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	That's a good  question.  I don't  know.  But is there some - We can collectively think of some - of some mechanism that might reduce the risk of - of just -	no
26040	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I mean, it - it - it -	no
26041	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	We - we  already  have visual feedback, right? You can  see  whether your mike is working or not. Um.	no
26042	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Right.	no
26043	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Right. So maybe it's just to admonish people to actually look at the screen at the beginning of the meeting to make sure they get a signal.	no
26044	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yep.	no
26045	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Test -	no
26046	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Turn off the screen saver during the meeting.	no
26047	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Tell them to test their mikes, or -	no
26048	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah, something.	no
26049	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	I think they sh-	no
26050	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah, I d- I don't know what to do other than -	no
26051	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	It - it can beep if one of the channels dies while recording.	no
26052	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	There's no sound out right now.	no
26053	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Oh.	no
26054	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	@@	no
26055	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Never mind.	no
26056	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	It should give the electric shock to the person recording the meeting.	no
26057	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yep. Yep. Yeah yeah. That would be good. Well, we can think about what to do about it, but it -	no
26058	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Oh yeah. That's a good one.	no
26059	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Wow, that's not a bad idea.	no
26060	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah. O_K.	no
26061	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	It's pretty clear we  can  detect it, so.	no
26062	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah. Alright.	no
26063	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	O_K. Are we done?	no
26064	transcript	transcript_Bmr021	Yeah.	yes
26065	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Oh.	no
26066	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So, uh -	yes
26067	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So, uh -	no
26068	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Alright.	no
26069	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Um, so I wanted to discuss digits briefly,	no
26070	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Oh good.	no
26071	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	but that won't take too long.	no
26072	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
26073	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K, agenda items,	no
26074	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Uh, we have digits,	no
26075	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	What else we got?	no
26076	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	New version of the presegmentation.	no
26077	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	New version of presegmentation.	no
26078	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Um,	no
26079	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	do we wanna say something about the,	no
26080	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah, why don't you summarize the -	no
26081	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	an update of the, uh, transcript?	no
26082	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Update on transcripts.	no
26083	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And I guess that includes some -	no
26084	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	the filtering for the,	no
26085	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	the A_S_I refs, too.	no
26086	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Mmm.	no
26087	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Filtering for what?	no
26088	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	For the references that we need to go from the -	no
26089	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	the   fancy  transcripts to the sort of   brain-dead.	no
26090	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	It'll - it'll be - basically it'll be a re-cap of a meeting that we had jointly this morning.	no
26091	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Uh-huh.	no
26092	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	With Don, as well.	no
26093	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Mm-hmm.	no
26094	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Got it.	no
26095	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Anything else more pressing than those things? So -	no
26096	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So, why don't we just do those. You said yours was brief, so -	yes
26097	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Anything else more pressing than those things? So -	no
26098	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So, why don't we just do those. You said yours was brief, so -	no
26099	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K.	no
26100	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K well, the, w- uh	no
26101	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	as you can see from the numbers on the digits we're almost done.	no
26102	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	The digits goes up to  about four thousand.	no
26103	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Um,	no
26104	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	and so, uh,	no
26105	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	we probably will be done with the T_I-digits in,	no
26106	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	um, another couple weeks.	no
26107	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	um, depending on how many we read each time.	no
26108	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So there were a bunch that we skipped.	no
26109	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	You know, someone fills out the form and then they're not at the meeting and so it's blank.	no
26110	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Um, but those are almost all filled in as well.	no
26111	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And so, once we're - it's  done  it would be very nice to train up a recognizer and actually start working with this data.	no
26112	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So we'll have a corpus that's the size of T_I-digits?	no
26113	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And so -	no
26114	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	One particular test set of T_I-digits.	no
26115	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Test set, O_K.	no
26116	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So, I - I extracted,	no
26117	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Ther- there was a file sitting around which people have used here as a test set.	no
26118	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	It had been randomized and so on and that's just what I used to generate the order.	no
26119	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Oh! Great.	no
26120	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	of these particular ones.	no
26121	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Great.	no
26122	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Um -	no
26123	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So, I'm impressed by what we could do,	no
26124	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Is take the standard training set for T_I-digits, train up with whatever, you know,	no
26125	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	great features we think we have, uh for instance,	no
26126	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	and then test on uh this test set.	no
26127	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And presumably uh it should do reasonably well on that, and then, presumably, we should go to the distant mike, and it should do poorly.	no
26128	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
26129	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
26130	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And then we should get really smart over the next year or two, and it - that should get better.	no
26131	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And inc- increase it by one or two percent, yeah.	no
26132	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah,	no
26133	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
26134	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Um, but,	no
26135	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	in order to do that we need to extract out the actual digits.	no
26136	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
26137	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Um,	no
26138	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	so that - the reason it's not just a transcript is that there're false starts, and misreads, and miscues and things like that.	no
26139	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And so I have a set of scripts and X_Waves where you just select the portion,	no
26140	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	hit R_,	no
26141	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	um, it tells you what the next one should be,	no
26142	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	and you just look for that.	no
26143	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	You know, so it - it'll put on the screen,	no
26144	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	"""The next set is six nine,"	no
26145	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	"nine two two""."	no
26146	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And you find that,	no
26147	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	and,	no
26148	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	hit the key and it records it in a file in a particular format.	no
26149	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So is this -	no
26150	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And so the -	no
26151	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	the  question  is, should we have the transcribers do that or should we just do it?	no
26152	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Well, some of us. I've been do- I've done,	no
26153	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	eight meetings, something like that,	no
26154	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	just by hand.	no
26155	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Just myself, rather.	no
26156	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So it will not take long.	no
26157	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Um -	no
26158	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Uh, what - what do you think?	no
26159	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	My feeling is that- we discussed this right before coffee and I think it's a - it's a fine idea partly because, um, it's not un- unrelated to their present skill set,	no
26160	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	but it will add, for them, an extra dimension, it might be an interesting break for them. And also it is contributing to the, uh,	no
26161	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	c- composition of the transcript cuz we can incorporate those numbers directly and it'll be a more complete transcript. So I'm - I think it's fine, that part.	no
26162	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	There is - there is -	no
26163	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So you think it's fine to have the  transcribers  do it?	no
26164	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Mm-hmm.	no
26165	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah, O_K.	no
26166	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	There's one other small bit, which is just entering the information which at s- which is at the top of this form,	no
26167	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Good.	no
26168	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	onto the computer,	no
26169	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	to go along with the - where the digits are recorded automatically.	no
26170	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
26171	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And so it's just,	no
26172	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	you know, typing in name, times - time, date, and so on.	no
26173	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Um, which again either  they  can do,	no
26174	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	but it is, you know,	no
26175	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	firing up an editor,	no
26176	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	or,	no
26177	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	again, I can do.	no
26178	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Or someone else can do.	no
26179	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And, that, you know, I'm not,	no
26180	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	that - that one I'm not so sure if it's into the - the,	no
26181	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	things that,	no
26182	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I,	no
26183	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	wanted to use the hours for, because the,	no
26184	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	the time that they'd be spending doing that they wouldn't be able to be putting more words on.	no
26185	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Mmm.	no
26186	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	But that's really your choice, it's your -	no
26187	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So are these two  separate  tasks that can happen?	no
26188	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Or do they have to happen at the same time before -	no
26189	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	No they don't have - this -	no
26190	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	you have to enter the data  before,	no
26191	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	you do the second task, but they don't have to happen at the same time.	no
26192	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So it's - it's just I have a file whi- which has this information on it,	no
26193	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K.	no
26194	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	and then when you start using my scripts,	no
26195	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	for extracting the times,	no
26196	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	it adds the times at the bottom of the file.	no
26197	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And so, um,	no
26198	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I mean, it's easy to create the files and leave them  blank,  and so actually we could do it in either order.	no
26199	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Oh, O_K.	no
26200	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Um,	no
26201	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	it's - it's  sort  of nice to have the same person do it just as a double-check,	no
26202	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	to make sure you're entering for the right person.	no
26203	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	But,	no
26204	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	either way.	no
26205	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
26206	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah just by way of uh, uh, a uh,	no
26207	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	order of magnitude, uh,	no
26208	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	um, we've been working with this Aurora, uh data set.	no
26209	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And, uh, the best score,	no
26210	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	on the,	no
26211	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	nicest  part of the data, that is, where you've got training and test set that are basically the same kinds of noise and so forth,	no
26212	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh, is about, uh -	no
26213	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I think the best score was something like five percent,	no
26214	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh, error, per digit.	no
26215	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So, that -	no
26216	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Per digit.	no
26217	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Per digit.	no
26218	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	You're right. So if you were doing  ten digit,	no
26219	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh, recognition,  you would really be in trouble.	no
26220	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Mm-hmm.	no
26221	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So - So the -	no
26222	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	The point there, and this is uh car noise uh, uh things, but - but real -	no
26223	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	"real situation, well, ""real"","	no
26224	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Um, the - uh there's one microphone that's close, that they have as - as  this  sort of thing, close versus distant.	no
26225	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Uh but in a  car,  instead of - instead of having a projector noise it's - it's car noise.	no
26226	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Uh but it wasn't artificially added to get some - some artificial signal-to-noise ratio. It was just people driving around in a car.	no
26227	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So, that's - that's an indication, uh that was with,	no
26228	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	many sites competing, and this was the very  best  score and so forth, so.	no
26229	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Although the models weren't,	no
26230	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	More typical numbers like	no
26231	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	that good, right? I mean,	no
26232	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	the models are pretty crappy?	no
26233	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	You're right. I think that we could have done better on the models, but the thing is that we got - this - this is the kind of typical number,	no
26234	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	for all of the, uh, uh,	no
26235	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	things in this task, all of the, um,	no
26236	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	languages.	no
26237	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And so I - I think we'd probably - the models would be better in some than in others. Um,	no
26238	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Hmm.	no
26239	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	so, uh.	no
26240	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Anyway,  just an indication once you get into this kind of realm even if you're looking at connected digits it can be pretty hard.	no
26241	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Hmm.	no
26242	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	It's gonna be fun to see how we,	no
26243	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	compare at this.	no
26244	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	How did we do on the T_I-digits?	no
26245	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
26246	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Very exciting.	no
26247	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Well the  prosodics  are so much different s- it's gonna be,	no
26248	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	strange.	no
26249	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I mean the prosodics are not the same as T_I-digits, for example.	no
26250	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
26251	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So I'm - I'm not sure how much of effect that will have.	no
26252	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	H- how do -	no
26253	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	What do you mean, the prosodics?	no
26254	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Um, just what we were talking about with grouping.	no
26255	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	That with these, the grouping,	no
26256	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	there's no grouping at all, and so it's just -	no
26257	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	the only sort of	no
26258	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	discontinuity you have is at the beginning and the end.	no
26259	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So what are they doing in Aurora, are they reading actual phone numbers, or,	no
26260	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Aurora I don't know.	no
26261	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I don't know what they do in Aurora.	no
26262	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	a - a digit at a time, or - ?	no
26263	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Uh, I'm not sure how - no, no I mean it's connected - it's connected, uh,	no
26264	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Cuz it's -	no
26265	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Connected.	no
26266	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	digits, yeah.	no
26267	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So there's also the -	no
26268	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	But.	no
26269	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	But -	no
26270	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	not just the prosody but the cross -	no
26271	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	the cross-word modeling is probably quite different.	no
26272	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
26273	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	But in T_I-digits,	no
26274	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	H-	no
26275	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	they're reading things  like  zip codes and phone numbers and things like that, so it's gonna be different.	no
26276	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
26277	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	How do we do on T_I-digits?	no
26278	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I don't remember. I mean, very good, right?	no
26279	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah, I mean we were in the.	no
26280	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	One and a half percent, two percent, something like that?	no
26281	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Uh, I th- no I think we got under a percent, but it was - but it's - but I mean.	no
26282	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Oh really? O_K.	no
26283	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	s-	no
26284	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	The  very  best system that I saw in the literature was a point two five percent or something that somebody had at - at Bell Labs, or.	no
26285	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Alright.	no
26286	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Uh, but.	no
26287	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Hmm.	no
26288	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	But, uh, sort of pulling out all the stops. But I think a  lot  of systems sort of get half a percent, or three-quarters a percent, and we're - we're in there somewhere.	no
26289	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
26290	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	But that - I mean it's really - it's - it's close-talking mikes, no noise, clean signal,	no
26291	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	just digits, I mean,	no
26292	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
26293	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	every- everything is good.	no
26294	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	It's the beginning of time in speech recognition.	no
26295	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yes, exactly.	no
26296	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
26297	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And we've only recently got it to anywhere near human.	no
26298	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	It's like the,	no
26299	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	single cell,	no
26300	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Pre-	no
26301	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	you know,	no
26302	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	prehistory.	no
26303	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	it's the beginning of life, yeah.	no
26304	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And it's still like an order of magnitude worse than what humans do.	no
26305	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
26306	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
26307	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So.	no
26308	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	When - When they're wide awake, yeah.	no
26309	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
26310	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Um,  after coffee, you're right.	no
26311	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	After coffee.	no
26312	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Not after lunch.	no
26313	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K, so, um,	no
26314	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	what I'll do then is I'll go ahead and enter,	no
26315	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	this data.	no
26316	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And then, hand off to Jane,	no
26317	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	and the transcribers to do the actual extraction of the digits.	no
26318	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
26319	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
26320	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	One question I have that -	no
26321	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	that- I mean, we wouldn't know the answer to now but might,	no
26322	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Hmm.	no
26323	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	do some guessing, but I was talking before about doing some model- modeling of arti- uh,	no
26324	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh,  marking  of articulatory,	no
26325	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	features,	no
26326	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	with overlap and so on.	no
26327	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And,	no
26328	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	and,	no
26329	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	um,	no
26330	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	On some subset.	no
26331	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	One thought might be to do this uh, on - on the digits, or some piece of the digits. Uh, it'd be easier,	no
26332	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh, and so forth. The only thing is I'm a little concerned that maybe the  kind  of phenomena,	no
26333	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	in w- i- i-	no
26334	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	The reason for doing it is because the - the argument is that certainly with conversational speech, the stuff that we've looked at here before,	no
26335	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	um, just doing the simple mapping,	no
26336	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	from, um,	no
26337	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	the phone,	no
26338	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	to the corresponding features that you could look up in a book,	no
26339	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh, isn't right.	no
26340	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	It isn't actually right. In fact there's these overlapping  processes   where some voicing some up and then some, you know,	no
26341	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	"some nasality is - comes in here, and so forth. And you do this gross thing saying ""Well I guess it's this phone starting there""."	no
26342	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So,	no
26343	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh, that's the reasoning.  But,	no
26344	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	It could be that when we're reading digits, because it's - it's for such a limited set,	no
26345	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	that maybe -	no
26346	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	maybe that phenomenon doesn't occur as much. I don't know.	no
26347	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Di- an- anybody - ?  Do you have any - ?  Anybody have any opinion about that, or - ?	no
26348	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	@@ .	no
26349	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	It s- strikes me that there are more - each of them is more informative because it's so,	no
26350	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	random, and that people might articulate more, and you that might end up with more - a closer correspondence.	no
26351	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Mm-hmm.	no
26352	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah - that's - I - I agree. That - it's just -	no
26353	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
26354	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Sort of less predictability, and -	no
26355	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Mm-hmm.	no
26356	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
26357	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Well it's definitely true that, when people are,	no
26358	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	It's a -	no
26359	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	reading,	no
26360	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	even if they're re-reading what,	no
26361	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	they had said spontaneously, that they have very different patterns. Mitch showed that, and some,	no
26362	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
26363	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	dissertations have shown that.	no
26364	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So the fact that they're reading, first of all, whether they're reading in a room of,	no
26365	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	people, or rea- you know, just the fact that they're reading will make a difference.	no
26366	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
26367	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And,	no
26368	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Well -	no
26369	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	depends what you're interested in.	no
26370	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Would,	no
26371	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	this corpus really be the right one to even try that on?	no
26372	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	See, I don't know. So, may- maybe the thing will be do - to take some very small subset,	no
26373	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I- mean not have a big,	no
26374	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	program, but take a small set,	no
26375	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh, subset of the conversational speech and a small subset of the digits,	no
26376	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	and  look	no
26377	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	and - and just get a feeling for it.	no
26378	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Um, just take a look.	no
26379	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Really.	no
26380	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	H-	no
26381	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Cuz I don't think anybody is, I- at least, I don't know,	no
26382	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	of anybody, uh,	no
26383	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	well, I don't know,	no
26384	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	That could - could be an interesting design, too, cuz then you'd have the com- the comparison of the,	no
26385	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	You hafta -	no
26386	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	the  answers .	no
26387	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Hey.	no
26388	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh, predictable speech versus the less predictable speech and maybe you'd find that it worked in,	no
26389	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
26390	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	in the,	no
26391	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	case of the pr- of the, uh, non-predictable.	no
26392	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
26393	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Hafta think about,	no
26394	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	the particular acoustic features to mark, too, because,	no
26395	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Mm-hmm.	no
26396	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I mean,  some  things,	no
26397	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	they wouldn't be able to mark, like,	no
26398	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh,	no
26399	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	you know, uh, tense lax.	no
26400	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Some things are really difficult.	no
26401	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	You know,	no
26402	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	just listening.	no
26403	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	M- I think we can get Ohala in to,	no
26404	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Well.	no
26405	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	give us some advice on that.	no
26406	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
26407	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Also I thought you were thinking of a much more restricted set of features, that -	no
26408	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah, but I - I - I - I was,	no
26409	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	like he said,  I was gonna bring John in and ask John what he thought.	no
26410	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah, sure.	no
26411	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Sure.	no
26412	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
26413	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
26414	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	But I mean you want - you want it be restrictive but you also want it to - to - to have coverage.	no
26415	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
26416	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	You know i- you should.	no
26417	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah	no
26418	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	It should be such that if you,	no
26419	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	if you, uh,	no
26420	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	if you had o- um,	no
26421	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	all of the features,	no
26422	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	determined that you - that you were uh ch- have chosen,	no
26423	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	that that would tell you,	no
26424	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh,	no
26425	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	in the steady-state case, uh, the phone.	no
26426	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So,	no
26427	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K.	no
26428	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	um.	no
26429	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Even,	no
26430	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I guess with vowels that would be pretty hard,	no
26431	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	wouldn't it?	no
26432	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	To identify actually, you know, which one it is?	no
26433	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	It would seem to me that the points of articulation would be m- more,	no
26434	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	g- uh, I mean that's - I think about articulatory features, I think about,	no
26435	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	points of articulation, which means,	no
26436	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh, rather than vowels.	no
26437	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
26438	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Points  of articulation? What do you mean?	no
26439	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So, is it, uh, bilabial or dental or is it, you know,	no
26440	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	palatal.	no
26441	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Mm-hmm.	no
26442	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	@@	no
26443	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Which - which are all like where - where your tongue comes to rest.	no
26444	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Uvular.	no
26445	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Place of ar- place of articulation.	no
26446	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Place,  place.	no
26447	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Place.	no
26448	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Place. Thank you, what - whatev- whatever I s- said, that's - I really meant place.	no
26449	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
26450	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K.	no
26451	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
26452	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K, I see.	no
26453	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
26454	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K we got our jargon then, O_K.	no
26455	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
26456	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Uh.	no
26457	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Well it's also, there's,	no
26458	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	really a difference between,	no
26459	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	the pronunciation models in the dictionary, and,	no
26460	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	the pronunciations that people produce.	no
26461	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And, so,	no
26462	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	You get,	no
26463	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	some of that information from Steve's work on the -	no
26464	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
26465	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	on the labeling and it really,	no
26466	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
26467	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I actually think that data should be used more. That maybe,	no
26468	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	although I think the meeting context is great, that he has transcriptions that give you the actual phone sequence.	no
26469	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And you can go from -	no
26470	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	not from that to the articulatory features, but that would be a better starting point for marking,	no
26471	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	the gestural features, then,	no
26472	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	data where you don't have that, because,	no
26473	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	we - you wanna know,	no
26474	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	both about the way that they're producing a certain sound,	no
26475	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	and what kinds of,	no
26476	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	you know  what kinds of,	no
26477	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	phonemic,	no
26478	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	differences you get between these,	no
26479	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	transcribed,	no
26480	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	sequences and the dictionary ones.	no
26481	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Well you might be right that mi- might be the way at  getting  at,	no
26482	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	what I was talking about,	no
26483	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	but the particular reason why I was interested in doing that was because I  remember,	no
26484	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	when that happened, and,	no
26485	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	John Ohala  was  over here and he was  looking  at the spectrograms of the more difficult ones.	no
26486	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Uh, he didn't know what to say,	no
26487	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	about,	no
26488	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	what is the sequence of phones there.	no
26489	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	They came up with some compromise.	no
26490	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Because that really wasn't what it look like. It didn't look like a sequence of phones it look like this blending thing happening here and here and here.	no
26491	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
26492	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
26493	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
26494	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah, so you have this feature here, and,	no
26495	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	There was no  name  for that.	no
26496	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
26497	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	But -	no
26498	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	overlap, yeah.	no
26499	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right. But it still is - there's a -	no
26500	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
26501	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	there are two steps. One -	no
26502	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	you know, one is going from a dictionary pronunciation of something,	no
26503	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And -	no
26504	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
26505	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	like,	no
26506	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	"""gonna see you tomorrow"", it could be ""going to"" or ""gonna"" or "" gonta  s-"" you know."	no
26507	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
26508	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
26509	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	"Or "" gonta ""."	no
26510	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And,	no
26511	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	yeah.	no
26512	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	"""Gonna see you tomorrow"", uh,"	no
26513	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	""" guh  see you tomorrow""."	no
26514	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And,	no
26515	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	that it would be nice to have these,	no
26516	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	intermediate, or these - some - these reduced pronunciations that those transcribers had marked or to have people mark those as well.	no
26517	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Mm-hmm.	no
26518	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Because, it's not,	no
26519	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	um,	no
26520	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	that easy to go from the,	no
26521	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	dictionary,	no
26522	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	word pronuncia- the dictionary phone pronunciation,	no
26523	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	to the gestural one without this intermediate or a syllable level kind of,	no
26524	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	representation.	no
26525	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Well I don't think Morgan's suggesting that we  do  that, though.	no
26526	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Do you mean,	no
26527	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
26528	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah, I mean, I- I- I'm jus- at the moment of course we're just talking about what,	no
26529	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	to provide as a tool for people to do research who have different ideas about how to do it.	no
26530	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So for instance,	no
26531	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	you might have someone who just has a wor- has words with states,	no
26532	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	and has uh - uh,	no
26533	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	comes from articulatory gestures to that.	no
26534	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And someone else,	no
26535	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	might actually want some phonetic uh intermediate thing.	no
26536	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So I think it would be - be best to have all of it if we could.	no
26537	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	But  um,	no
26538	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	But -	no
26539	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	What I'm imagining is a score-like notation,	no
26540	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
26541	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	where each line is a particular  feature.	no
26542	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right, so you would say, you know, it's voiced through here, and so you have label here, and you have nas- nasal here, and,	no
26543	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
26544	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	they - they could be overlapping in all sorts of bizarre ways that don't correspond to the timing on phones.	no
26545	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I mean this is the kind of reason why - I remember when at one of the Switchboard,	no
26546	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	workshops, that uh when we  talked  about doing the transcription project,	no
26547	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	"Dave Talkin said, ""can't be done""."	no
26548	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
26549	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	He was - he was, what - what he meant was that this isn't,	no
26550	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	you know, a sequence of phones, and when you actually look at Switchboard that's,	no
26551	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	not what you see, and, you know.	no
26552	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And in - in fact the inter-annotator  agreement  was not that good, right?	no
26553	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And.	no
26554	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	On the harder ones?	no
26555	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	It, yeah I mean it was-	no
26556	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	It depends how you look at it, and I - I understand what you're saying about this,	no
26557	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
26558	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	kind of transcription exactly, because I've seen - you know, where does the voicing bar start and so forth.	no
26559	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
26560	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	All I'm saying is that,	no
26561	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	it is useful to have that -	no
26562	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	the transcription of what was  really  said, and which syllables were reduced.	no
26563	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Uh, if you're gonna add the features it's also useful to have some level of representation which is,	no
26564	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	is a reduced -	no
26565	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	it's a pronunciation variant,	no
26566	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	that currently the dictionaries don't give you because if you add them to the dictionary and you run recognition, you,	no
26567	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Mm-hmm.	no
26568	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
26569	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	you add confusion.	no
26570	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So people purposely don't add them.	no
26571	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
26572	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So it's useful to know which variant was -	no
26573	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	was produced, at least at the phone level.	no
26574	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So it would be - it would be great if we had,	no
26575	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	either these kind of,	no
26576	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	labelings on,	no
26577	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	the same portion of Switchboard that Steve marked, or,	no
26578	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Steve's type markings on this data,	no
26579	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
26580	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	That's all,  I mean .	no
26581	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Exactly.	no
26582	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	with these.	no
26583	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
26584	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Exactly.	no
26585	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah, no I - I don't disagree with that.	no
26586	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And Steve's type is fairly - it's not that slow,	no
26587	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh,	no
26588	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh, I dunno exactly what the,	no
26589	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	timing was, but.	no
26590	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah u- I don't disagree with it the on- the only thing is that,	no
26591	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	What you actually will end - en- end up with is something,	no
26592	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	i- it's all compromised, right, so,	no
26593	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	the string that you end up with isn't,	no
26594	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	actually,	no
26595	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	what happened.	no
26596	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	But it's - it's the best  compromise  that a group of people scratching their heads could come up with to describe what happened.	no
26597	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Mm-hmm.	no
26598	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And it's more accurate than,	no
26599	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	But.	no
26600	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And it's more accurate than the - than the dictionary or,	no
26601	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	phone  labels.	no
26602	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	The word.	no
26603	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
26604	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	if you've got a pronunciation uh lexicon that has three or four, this might be have been the fifth one that you  tr-  that you pruned or whatever, so sure.	no
26605	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So it's like a continuum. It's - you're going all the way down, yeah.	no
26606	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
26607	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
26608	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
26609	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	That's what I meant is - an- and in some places it would fill in,	no
26610	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
26611	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
26612	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Well -	no
26613	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So - the kinds of gestural features are not everywhere.	no
26614	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So there are some things that you don't have access to either from your ear  or  the spectrogram,	no
26615	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
26616	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Mm-hmm.	no
26617	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	but you know what phone it was and that's about all you can -	no
26618	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	all you can say. And then there are  other  cases where,	no
26619	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
26620	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	It's basically just having,	no
26621	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	nasality, voicing -	no
26622	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	multiple levels of -	no
26623	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
26624	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	of,	no
26625	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	information and marking,	no
26626	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
26627	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
26628	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	on the signal.	no
26629	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Well the other difference is that the - the  features,	no
26630	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
26631	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	are not synchronous, right. They overlap each other in weird ways.	no
26632	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Mm-hmm.	no
26633	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Mm-hmm.	no
26634	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So it's not a strictly one-dimensional signal.	no
26635	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
26636	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So I think that's sorta qualitatively different.	no
26637	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right. You can add the features in,	no
26638	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh, but it'll be underspecified. Th-  there'll   be no way for you to actually mark what was said completely by features.	no
26639	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Hmm.	no
26640	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Well not with our current system but you could imagine designing a system,	no
26641	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And i- if you're -	no
26642	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	that the states were features, rather than phones.	no
26643	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Well,	yes
26644	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Well,	no
26645	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	That's -	no
26646	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	we - we've probably have a  separate,	no
26647	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	um,	no
26648	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
26649	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	discussion of, uh - of whether you can do that.	no
26650	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Well,  isn't that - I thought that was,	no
26651	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	well but that - wasn't that kinda the direction? I thought	no
26652	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah, so I mean, what,	no
26653	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	what - where this is, I mean,	no
26654	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I- I want- would like to have something that's useful to people other than those who are doing the specific kind of research I have in mind,	no
26655	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	so it should be something broader. But,	no
26656	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	The -  but  uh where I'm coming from is, uh,	no
26657	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	we're coming off of stuff that  Larry Saul  did with - with, um,	no
26658	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh,  John Dalan  and  Muzim Rahim  in which, uh, they,	no
26659	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh, have, um,	no
26660	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	a m- a multi-band system that is, uh, trained through a combination of gradient learning an- and E_M,	no
26661	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	to  um,	no
26662	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	estimate, uh,	no
26663	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	the,	no
26664	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh, value for m- for - for a particular feature.	no
26665	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K.	no
26666	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And this is part of a larger,	no
26667	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	image that  John Dalan  has about how the human brain does it in which he's sort of imagining that,	no
26668	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	individual frequency channels are coming up with their own estimate,	no
26669	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	of - of these,	no
26670	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	these kinds of - something like this. Might not be, you know, exact features that,	no
26671	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Jakobson thought of or something. But I mean you know some,	no
26672	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	something like that.	no
26673	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Some kind of low-level features, which are  not,	no
26674	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	fully, you know, phone classification.	no
26675	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And the - the - th- this particular image,	no
26676	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	of how  thi-  how it's done,	no
26677	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	is that,	no
26678	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	then given all of these estimates at that level,	no
26679	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	there's a level above it,	no
26680	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	then which is - is making,	no
26681	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	some kind of sound unit classification such as, you know, phone and - and, you know.	no
26682	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	You could argue what,	no
26683	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	what a sound unit should be, and - and so forth. But that - that's sort of what I was imagining doing,	no
26684	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	um, and -	no
26685	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	but it's still open within that whether you would have an intermediate level in which it was actually phones, or  not.	no
26686	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	You wouldn't necessarily have to.	no
26687	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Um, but,	no
26688	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Again, I wouldn't wanna,	no
26689	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	wouldn't want what we - we produced to be so, know, local in perspective that it - it was matched,	no
26690	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	what we were thinking of doing one week,	no
26691	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And - and,	no
26692	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	and, you know, what you're saying is absolutely right. That,	no
26693	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	that if we,	no
26694	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	can we should put in,	no
26695	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh, another level of,	no
26696	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	of description there if we're gonna get into some of this low-level stuff.	no
26697	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Well, you know, um - I mean if we're talking about,	no
26698	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	having the,	no
26699	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	annotators annotate these kinds of features, it seems like,	no
26700	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	You know, you -	no
26701	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	The - the question is,	no
26702	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	do they do that on,	no
26703	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	meeting data?	no
26704	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Or do they do that on,	no
26705	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Switchboard?	no
26706	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	That's what I was saying, maybe meeting data  isn't  the right corpus.	no
26707	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	W-	no
26708	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Well it seems like you could do both. I mean, I was thinking that it would be interesting,	no
26709	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Mm-hmm.	no
26710	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	to do it with respect to,	no
26711	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	parts of Switchboard anyway, in terms of, uh - partly to see,	no
26712	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Mm-hmm.	no
26713	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	if you could,	no
26714	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	generate first  guesses  at what the articulatory feature would be,  based  on the phone representation at that lower level. It might be a time gain.	no
26715	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	But also in terms of comparability of, um,	no
26716	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Mm-hmm.	no
26717	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Well cuz the- yeah, and then also, if you did it on Switchboard, you would have,	no
26718	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	what you gain	no
26719	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	the full continuum of transcriptions. You'd have it,	no
26720	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yep.	no
26721	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	from the lowest level, the ac- acoustic features, then you'd have the,	no
26722	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	you know, the phonetic level that Steve did, and,	no
26723	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Mm-hmm.	no
26724	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah that - that's all I was thinking about. it  is  telephone band, so,	no
26725	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	yeah.	no
26726	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And you could tell that -	no
26727	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	It'd be a  complete,	no
26728	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And you get the relative gain  up ahead .	no
26729	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	the bandwidth might be -	no
26730	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	set then.	no
26731	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	It's so it's a little different.	no
26732	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
26733	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So I mean i- we'll see wha- how much we can,	no
26734	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Mm-hmm.	no
26735	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh,	no
26736	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	get the people to do, and how much money we'll have and all this sort of thing, but,	no
26737	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Mm-hmm.	no
26738	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	But it - it might be good to do what Jane was saying uh, you know,	no
26739	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Might be do both.	no
26740	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	seed  it, with,	no
26741	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	guesses about what we think the features are, based on,	no
26742	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	you know, the phone or Steve's transcriptions or something.	no
26743	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	to make it quicker.	no
26744	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Alright, so based on the phone transcripts they would all be synchronous, but then you could imagine,	no
26745	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Adjusting? Yeah, exactly.	no
26746	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	nudging them here and there.	no
26747	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Scoot the voicing over a little, because -	no
26748	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
26749	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
26750	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Well I think what - I mean I'm - I'm a l- little behind in what they're doing,	no
26751	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	now, and, uh, the stuff they're doing on Switchboard now. But I think that,	no
26752	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Steve and the gang are doing,	no
26753	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	something  with an automatic system first and then doing some adjustment.	no
26754	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	As I re- as I recall.	no
26755	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So I mean that's probably the right way to go anyway, is to - is to start off with an automatic system with a pretty rich pronunciation dictionary that,	no
26756	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	that,	no
26757	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	um,	no
26758	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	you know,	no
26759	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	tries,	no
26760	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	to label it all.	no
26761	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And then,	no
26762	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	people go through and fix it.	no
26763	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So in - in our case you'd think about us s- starting with maybe the regular dictionary entry, and then?	no
26764	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Well,	no
26765	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Or  would we -	no
26766	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	regular dictionary, I mean, this is a pretty rich dictionary. It's got,	no
26767	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	got a fair number of pronunciations in it	no
26768	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Or you could start from the - if we were gonna,	no
26769	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	But -	no
26770	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	do the same set,	no
26771	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	of sentences that Steve had,	no
26772	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	done, we could start with those transcriptions.	no
26773	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Mm-hmm.	no
26774	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
26775	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	That's actually what I was thinking, is  tha-  - the problem is when you  run,	no
26776	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So I was thinking -	no
26777	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
26778	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
26779	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh, if you run a regular dictionary,	no
26780	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	um,	no
26781	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	even if you have variants,	no
26782	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	in there,	no
26783	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
26784	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	which most people don't, you don't always get,	no
26785	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	out,	no
26786	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	the actual pronunciations, so that's why the human transcriber's giving you the -	no
26787	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
26788	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	that pronunciation, and so y-	no
26789	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Actually maybe they're using phone recognizers.	no
26790	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Oh.	no
26791	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	they - they - I thought that they were - we  should  catch up on what Steve is, uh - I think that would be a good i- good idea.	no
26792	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	They are.	no
26793	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Is that what they're doing?	no
26794	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Oh, O_K.	no
26795	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
26796	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah, so I think that i- i- we also don't have, I mean,	no
26797	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	we've got a good start on it, but we don't have a really good,	no
26798	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	meeting,	no
26799	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	recorder or recognizer or transcriber or anything yet, so.	no
26800	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
26801	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So, I mean another way to look at this is to,	no
26802	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	is to, uh,	no
26803	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	do some stuff on Switchboard which has all this other,	no
26804	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	stuff to it.	no
26805	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And then, um,	no
26806	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	As we get,	no
26807	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	further down the road and we can do more things ahead of time, we can,	no
26808	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Mm-hmm.	no
26809	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K.	no
26810	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	do some of the same things to the meeting data.	no
26811	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
26812	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And I'm - and these people might - they - they are, s-	no
26813	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah	no
26814	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	most of them  are  trained with I_P_A. They'd be able to do phonetic-level coding, or articulatory.	no
26815	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Are they busy for the next couple years, or - ?	no
26816	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Well, you know, I mean they,	no
26817	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	they - they're interested in continuing working with us, so - I mean - I,	no
26818	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	and this would be up their alley, so, we could - when the - when you d-	no
26819	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	meet with,	no
26820	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	with John Ohala and find,	no
26821	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	you know  what	no
26822	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	taxonomy you want to apply, then,	no
26823	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	they'd be,	no
26824	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
26825	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	good to train onto it.	no
26826	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
26827	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Anyway, this is,	no
26828	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
26829	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	not an urgent thing at all, just it came up.	no
26830	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	It'd be very interesting though, to have  that data.	no
26831	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
26832	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I wonder, how would you do a forced alignment?	no
26833	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I think so, too.	no
26834	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Might -	no
26835	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Interesting idea.	no
26836	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	To - to - I mean, you'd wanna iterate, somehow.	no
26837	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah. It's interesting thing to think about.	no
26838	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	It might be -	no
26839	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Hmm.	no
26840	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I was thinking it might be n-	no
26841	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I mean you'd - you'd want models for spreading.	no
26842	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Of the f- acoustic features?	no
26843	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
26844	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Mm-hmm.	no
26845	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Mm-hmm.	no
26846	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
26847	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Well it might be neat to do some,	no
26848	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	phonetic,	no
26849	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	features on these,	no
26850	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	"nonword   words.  Are - are these kinds of words that people never - the ""huh""s and the ""hmm""s and the ""huh-"""	no
26851	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	and the uh -	no
26852	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	These k- No, I'm  serious.  There are all these kinds of  functional,	no
26853	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh, elements. I don't know what you call  them.	no
26854	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	But not just fill pauses but all kinds of ways of  interrupting  and so forth.	no
26855	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Uh-huh.	no
26856	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	"And some of them are,  yeah, ""uh-huh""s, and ""hmm""s, and,"	no
26857	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	"""hmm!"""	no
26858	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	"""hmm"""	no
26859	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	"""O_K"", ""uh"""	no
26860	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Grunts, uh,  that  might be interesting.	no
26861	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	He's got lip -  lipsmacks.	no
26862	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	In the meetings.	no
26863	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	We should move on.	no
26864	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
26865	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Uh,	yes
26866	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Uh,	no
26867	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	new version of, uh, presegmentation?	no
26868	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Uh, oh yeah, um,	no
26869	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I worked a little bit on the - on the presegmentation to - to get another version which does channel-specific, uh, speech-nonspeech detection.	no
26870	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And, what I did is I used some normalized features which, uh, look in- into the - which is normalized energy, uh,	no
26871	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	energy normalized by the mean over the channels and by the,	no
26872	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	minimum over the,  other .	no
26873	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	within each channel.	no
26874	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And to - to, mm,	no
26875	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	to, yeah, to normalize also loudness and - and modified loudness and things and that those special features  actually  are in my feature vector.	no
26876	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Oh.	no
26877	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And, and,	no
26878	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	therefore to be able to, uh, somewhat distinguish between foreground and background speech in - in the different - in - each channel.	no
26879	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And,	no
26880	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	eh, I tested it on - on three or four meetings and it seems to work, well yeah, fairly well, I - I would say.	no
26881	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	There are some problems with the lapel mike.	no
26882	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Of course.	no
26883	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
26884	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Uh, yeah.	no
26885	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Wow that's great.	no
26886	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And.	no
26887	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So I - I understand that's what you were saying about your problem with,	no
26888	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
26889	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	minimum.	no
26890	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And.	no
26891	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah, and - and I had - I had, uh, specific problems with.	no
26892	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I get it.	no
26893	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So new- use ninetieth quartile, rather than,	no
26894	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
26895	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
26896	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	minimum.	no
26897	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Wow.	no
26898	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah - yeah, then - I - I did some - some - some things like that,	no
26899	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Interesting.	no
26900	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	as there - there are some - some problems in,	no
26901	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	when,	no
26902	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	in the channel, there -  they  -  the  the speaker doesn't - doesn't talk much or doesn't talk at all.	no
26903	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Then,	no
26904	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	the,	no
26905	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	yeah, there are - there are some problems with - with - with n- with normalization, and,	no
26906	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	then, uh, there the system doesn't work at all.	no
26907	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So, I'm - I'm glad that there is the - the digit part, where everybody is forced to say something,	no
26908	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
26909	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	so,	no
26910	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	that's - that's great for - for my purpose.	no
26911	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And,	no
26912	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	the thing is I - I,	no
26913	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	then the evaluation of - of the system is a little bit hard, as I don't have any references.	no
26914	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Well we did the hand - the one by hand.	no
26915	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah, that's the one - one wh- where I do the training on so I can't do the evaluation on	no
26916	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So the thing is, can the transcribers perhaps do some,	no
26917	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Uh.	no
26918	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	some - some meetings in - in terms of speech-nonspeech in - in the specific channels?	no
26919	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Well won't you have that from their transcriptions?	no
26920	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Well, I have -	no
26921	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Well, O_K, so, now we need - so, um,	no
26922	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	No, cuz we need is really tight.	no
26923	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
26924	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I think I might have done what you're requesting, though I did it in the service of a different thing.	no
26925	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Oh, great.	no
26926	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I have thirty minutes that I've more tightly transcribed with reference to individual channels.	no
26927	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K.	no
26928	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K, that's great.	no
26929	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	That's great for me. Yeah, so.	no
26930	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And I could - And -	no
26931	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Hopefully that's not the same meeting that we did.	no
26932	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And -	no
26933	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	No, actually it's a different meeting.	no
26934	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Good.	no
26935	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So, um, e- so the, you know, we have the,	no
26936	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K.	no
26937	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	th- they transcribe as if it's one channel with these - with the slashes to separate the overlapping parts. And  then  we run it through - then it - then I'm gonna edit it and I'm gonna run it through channelize which takes it into Dave Gelbart's form- format. And then you have,	no
26938	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
26939	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
26940	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	all these things split across according to channel, and then that means that,	no
26941	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	if a person contributed more than once in a given,	no
26942	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	overlap during that time bend that -	no
26943	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	that two parts of the utterance end up together, it's the same channel,	no
26944	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	and then I took his tool, and last night for the first thirty minutes of	no
26945	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K.	no
26946	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	one of these transcripts, I,	no
26947	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	tightened up the, um,	no
26948	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	boundaries on individual speakers' channels, cuz his - his interface  allows  me to have total flexibility in the time tags across the channels.	no
26949	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K.	no
26950	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
26951	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
26952	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And  um,	no
26953	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So, current -	no
26954	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	so, yeah - yeah, that - that - that's great, but what  would  be nice to have some more meetings, not just one meeting to - to be sure that - that,	no
26955	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	so.	no
26956	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yes.	no
26957	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Might not be what you need.	no
26958	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	there is a system,	no
26959	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah, so if we could get a couple meetings done with that level of precision I think that would be a good idea.	no
26960	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K.	no
26961	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Oh, O_K.	no
26962	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
26963	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Uh, how - how m- much time - so the meetings vary in length, what are we talking about in terms of the number of minutes you'd like to have as your - as your training set?	no
26964	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	It seems to me  that  it  would  be good to have,	no
26965	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	a few minutes from - from different meetings, so.	no
26966	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	But I'm not sure about how much.	no
26967	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K, now you're saying different meetings because of different  speakers  or because of different  audio  quality or  both  or - ?	no
26968	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Both - both. Different - different number of speakers, different speakers, different  conditions.	no
26969	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K.	no
26970	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah, we don't have that much variety in meetings yet, uh, I mean we have this	no
26971	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	meeting and the feature meeting and we have a couple others that we have uh,	no
26972	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah, m-	no
26973	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	couple examples of.	no
26974	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
26975	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Mm-hmm.	no
26976	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	But -	no
26977	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	but, uh,	no
26978	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Even probably with the gains  differently will affect it, you mean -	no
26979	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Uh, not really as - uh, because of the normalization, yeah. Yeah.	no
26980	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Poten- potentially.	no
26981	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Oh, cuz  you  use the normalization? O_K.	no
26982	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Oh, O_K.	no
26983	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	We can try running - we haven't done this yet because,	no
26984	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	um,	no
26985	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh, Andreas an- is - is gonna move over the S_R_I recognizer. i- basically I ran out of machines at S_R_I,	no
26986	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	cuz we're running the evals  and I just don't have machine time there.	no
26987	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K.	no
26988	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	But, once that's moved over,	no
26989	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh, hopefully in a -	no
26990	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	a couple days,	no
26991	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	then, we can take,	no
26992	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	um,	no
26993	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	what Jane just told us about as,	no
26994	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Oh, shoot!	no
26995	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	the presegmented,	no
26996	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	the - the segmentations that you did,	no
26997	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
26998	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
26999	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	at level eight or som-  at some,	no
27000	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	The pre- presegment-  yeah.	no
27001	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	threshold that Jane,	no
27002	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
27003	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	tha-  right,	no
27004	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	and try doing,	no
27005	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	forced alignment.	no
27006	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	um,	no
27007	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	With the recognizer? Yeah.	no
27008	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	on the word strings. And  if  it's good, then that will - that may give you a good boundary. Of course if it's good, we don't -	no
27009	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	then we're - we're fine, but,	no
27010	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah. M-	no
27011	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I don't know yet whether these,	no
27012	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	segments that contain a lot of pauses around the words,	no
27013	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I -	no
27014	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	will work or not.	no
27015	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I would quite like to have some manually transcribed references for - for the system, as I'm not sure if - if it's really good to compare with - with some other automatic,	no
27016	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
27017	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
27018	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	found boundaries.	no
27019	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Well, no, if we were to start with this and then tweak it h- manually, would that - that would be O_K?	no
27020	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
27021	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
27022	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah  sure.	no
27023	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	They might be O_K. It - you know it really depends on a lot of things, but,	no
27024	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K.	no
27025	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
27026	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I would have maybe a transcriber,	no
27027	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh, look at the result of a forced alignment and then adjust those. That might save some time.	no
27028	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
27029	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	To a- adjust them, or, yeah.	no
27030	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah, yeah.	no
27031	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	If they're horrible it won't help at all, but they might not be horrible.	no
27032	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah, great.	no
27033	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
27034	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So - but I'll let you know when we,	no
27035	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K, great.	no
27036	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh, have that.	no
27037	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	How many minutes would you want from - I mean, we could  easily,	no
27038	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	get a section, you know, like say a minute or so, from every meeting that we have so f- from the newer ones that we're working on,	no
27039	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	everyone that we have.	no
27040	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And then,	no
27041	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	should provide this.	no
27042	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	If it's not the  first  minute of - of the meeting, that - that's O_K with me, but, in - in the first minute, uh,	no
27043	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Often there are some - some strange things going on which - which aren't really,	no
27044	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	well, for, which - which aren't re- re- really good.	no
27045	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So.	no
27046	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	What - what I'd quite like, perhaps, is,	no
27047	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	to have,	no
27048	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	some five minutes of - of - of different  meetings,    so.	no
27049	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Somewhere  not  in the very beginning, five minutes, O_K.	no
27050	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
27051	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And, then I wanted to ask you just for my inter- information, then,	no
27052	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	would you,	no
27053	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	be trai-	no
27054	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	cuz I don't quite unders- so, would you be training then,	no
27055	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	um,	no
27056	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	the segmenter so that,	no
27057	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	it could, on the basis of that, segment the rest of the meeting?	no
27058	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So, if I give you like  five minutes is the idea that this would then be applied to,	no
27059	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh, to,	no
27060	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I - I could do a - a retraining with that, yeah.	no
27061	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	providing tighter time  bands?	no
27062	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Wow, interesting.	no
27063	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	That's - but - but I hope that I - I don't  need  to do it.	no
27064	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K.	no
27065	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So, uh it c- can be do in an unsupervised way.	no
27066	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Uh-huh.	no
27067	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Excellent.  Excellent,  O_K.	no
27068	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So.	no
27069	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I'm - I'm not sure,	no
27070	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	but, for - for - for those three meetings whi- which I - which I did,	no
27071	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	it seems to be,	no
27072	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	quite well, but,	no
27073	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	there are some - some - as I said some problems with the lapel mike, but,	no
27074	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	perhaps we can do something with - with cross-correlations to,	no
27075	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	to get rid of the - of those.	no
27076	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And.	no
27077	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah. That's - that's what I - that's my  future work. Well - well what I want to do is to - to look into cross-correlations for - for removing those,	no
27078	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	false overlaps.	no
27079	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Wonderful.	no
27080	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Are the, um, wireless,	no
27081	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	different than the wired,	no
27082	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	mikes, at all? I mean, have you noticed any difference?	no
27083	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I'm - I'm not sure, um,	no
27084	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	if - if there are any wired mikes in those meetings, or, uh, I have - have to loo- have a look at them but, I'm - I'm - I think there's no difference between,	no
27085	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So it's just the lapel versus everything else?	no
27086	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
27087	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
27088	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K, so then, if that's five minutes per meeting we've got like twelve minutes,	no
27089	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	twelve meetings,	no
27090	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	roughly, that I'm - that I've been working with, then -	no
27091	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Of - of - of the meetings that you're working with, how many of them are different,	no
27092	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	No.	no
27093	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	tha- are there any of them that are different than,	no
27094	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	these two meetings?	no
27095	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Well - oh wa- in terms of the speakers or the conditions or the?	no
27096	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah, speakers. Sorry. So.	no
27097	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Um,	no
27098	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah, that -	no
27099	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	we have different combinations of speakers. I mean, just from what I've seen, uh, there are some where,	no
27100	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	um,	no
27101	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	you're present or not present, and,	no
27102	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	then - then you have the difference between the networks group and this group	no
27103	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah, I know, some of the N_S_A meetings, yeah.	no
27104	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah. So I didn't know in the group you had if you had - so you have the networks meeting?	no
27105	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
27106	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yep, we do.	no
27107	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
27108	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Do you have any of Jerry's meetings in your,	no
27109	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	pack, er,	no
27110	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Um, no.	no
27111	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	No?	no
27112	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	We  could,  I mean you - you recorded one last week or so. I could get that new one in this week - I get that new one in.	no
27113	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yep.	no
27114	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	This week.	no
27115	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	We're gonna be recording them every  Monday,	no
27116	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	u-	no
27117	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
27118	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Cuz I think he really needs variety, and - and having as much variety for speaker certainly would be a big part of that I think.	no
27119	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	so -	no
27120	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Great.	no
27121	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
27122	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
27123	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K, so if I,	no
27124	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K, included - include,	no
27125	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K, then, uh, if I were to include all together samples from twelve meetings that would only take an hour and I could get the transcribers to do that right - I mean, what I mean is,	no
27126	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	that would be an hour  sampled,  and then they'd transcribe those - that hour, right? That's what I should do?	no
27127	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
27128	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And.	no
27129	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right. Ye- But you're - y-	no
27130	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	That's - that's.	no
27131	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I don't mean transcribe I mean - I mean adjust. So they get it into the multi-channel format and then adjust the timebands so it's precise.	no
27132	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So that should be faster than the ten times kind of thing, yeah.	no
27133	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Absolutely. I did - I did, um,	no
27134	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh, so,	no
27135	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	last night I did,	no
27136	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh,	no
27137	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Oh gosh,	no
27138	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	well, last night, I did about half an hour in,	no
27139	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	three hours,	no
27140	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
27141	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	which is not,	no
27142	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	terrific, but, um,	no
27143	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah. Well, that's probably.	no
27144	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	anyway, it's an hour and a half per -	no
27145	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So.	no
27146	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Well,	no
27147	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I can't calculate on my,	no
27148	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Do the transcribers actually start wi- with, uh, transcribing new meetings, or  are they?	no
27149	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	on my feet.	no
27150	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Well, um they're still working - they still have enough to finish that I haven't assigned a new meeting, but the next,	no
27151	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K.	no
27152	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	m- m- I was about to need to assign a new meeting and I was going to take it from one of the new ones, and I could easily give them Jerry Feldman's meeting, no problem.	no
27153	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K.	no
27154	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And,	no
27155	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K.	no
27156	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	then -	no
27157	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So they're really running out of,	no
27158	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	data, prett- I mean that's good.	no
27159	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Mm-hmm. Uh, that first set.	no
27160	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Um,	no
27161	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K.	no
27162	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	They're running out of data unless we s- make the decision that we should go over and start,	no
27163	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So -	no
27164	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh, transcribing the other set.	no
27165	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	There - the first - the first half.	no
27166	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And so I was in the process of like editing them but this is  wonderful  news.	no
27167	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
27168	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K.	no
27169	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Alright.	no
27170	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	We funded the experiment with, uh - also we were thinking maybe applying that that to getting the,	no
27171	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah, that'll be,	no
27172	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	very useful to getting the overlaps to be more precise all the way through.	no
27173	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So this, blends nicely into the update on transcripts.	no
27174	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yes, it does.	no
27175	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K.	no
27176	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So, um,	yes
27177	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K.	no
27178	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So, um,	no
27179	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	um,	no
27180	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah, please. Go ahead.	no
27181	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Liz, and - and Don, and I met this morning,	no
27182	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	in the BARCO room,	no
27183	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	with the lecture hall,	no
27184	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And this afternoon.	no
27185	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	and this afternoon, it drifted into the afternoon,	no
27186	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh, concerning this issue of,	no
27187	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	um,	no
27188	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	the,	no
27189	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	well there's basically the issue of the interplay between the transcript format and the processing that,	no
27190	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	they need to do for,	no
27191	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	the S_R_I recognizer.	no
27192	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And, um,	no
27193	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	well, so, I mentioned the process that I'm going through with the data, so, you know, I get the data back from the transcri- Well, s-	no
27194	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh, metaphorically, get the data back from the transcriber, and then I,	no
27195	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	check for simple things like spelling errors and things like that.	no
27196	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And, um,	no
27197	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I'm going to be doing a more thorough editing,	no
27198	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	with respect to consistency of the conventions.	no
27199	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	But they're - they're generally very good.	no
27200	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And,	no
27201	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	then,	no
27202	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I run it through, uh, the channelize program to get it into the multi-channel format,	no
27203	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K.	no
27204	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And  the,	no
27205	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	what we discussed this morning,	no
27206	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I would summarize as saying that,	no
27207	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	um,	no
27208	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	these units that result,	no
27209	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	in a - a particular channel and a particular timeband,	no
27210	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	at - at that level,	no
27211	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	um,	no
27212	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	vary in length.	no
27213	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And,	no
27214	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	um,	no
27215	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	their recognizer would prefer that the units not be overly long.	no
27216	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	But it's really an empirical question,	no
27217	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	whether the units we get at this point through,	no
27218	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	just that process I described might be sufficient for them. So,	no
27219	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	as a first pass through, a first chance without having to do a lot of hand-editing,	no
27220	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	what we're gonna do,	no
27221	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	is, I'll run it through channelize,	no
27222	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	give them those data after I've done the editing process and be sure it's clean.	no
27223	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And I can do that,	no
27224	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	pretty quickly,	no
27225	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Mm-hmm.	no
27226	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	with just,	no
27227	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	that minimal editing,	no
27228	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	without having to hand-break things.	no
27229	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And then we'll see if the units that we're getting,	no
27230	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh,	no
27231	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	with the - at that level,	no
27232	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	are sufficient.	no
27233	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And maybe they don't  need  to be further broken down.	no
27234	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And if they do need to be further broken down then maybe it just be piece-wise, maybe it won't be the whole thing.	no
27235	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So, that's - that's what we were discussing,	no
27236	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	this morning as far as I -	no
27237	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
27238	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Among - also we discussed some adaptational things, so it's like,	no
27239	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Then lots of -	no
27240	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
27241	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh -	no
27242	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	You know I hadn't, uh, incorporated,	no
27243	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	a convention explicitly to handle acronyms, for example,	no
27244	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	but if someone says,	no
27245	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	P_Z_M	no
27246	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	it would be nice to have that be directly interpretable from,	no
27247	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	the transcript what they said, or Pi- uh  Tcl   - T_C_L I mean. It's like	no
27248	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Mm-hmm.	no
27249	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	y- it's - and so,	no
27250	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	um,	no
27251	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I've - I've incorporated also convention,	no
27252	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	with that but that's easy to handle at the post editing phase, and I'll mention it to,	no
27253	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	transcribers for the next phase but that's O_K. And then,	no
27254	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	a similar conv- uh, convention for  numbers.  So if they say one-eighty-three versus one eight three.	no
27255	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Um,	no
27256	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	and also I'll be, um,	no
27257	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	encoding, as I do my post-editing, the,	no
27258	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	things that are in curly brackets, which are clarificational material.	no
27259	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And eh to incorporate, uh, keyword,	no
27260	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	at the beginning. So,	no
27261	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	it's gonna be either a gloss or it's gonna be a vocal sound like a,	no
27262	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	laugh or a cough,	no
27263	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	or, so forth.	no
27264	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Or a non-vocal sound like a doors- door-slam, and that can be easily done with a,	no
27265	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	you know, just a - one little additional thing in the,	no
27266	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	in the general format.	no
27267	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah we j- we just needed a way to,	no
27268	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	strip, you know, all the comments, all the things th- the - that	no
27269	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	linguist wants but the recognizer can't do anything with.	no
27270	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Um,	no
27271	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	but to keep things that we mapped to like reject models, or, you know,	no
27272	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh, mouth noise, or,	no
27273	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	cough.	no
27274	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And then there's this interesting issue Jane brought up which I hadn't thought about before but I was,	no
27275	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	realizing as I went through the transcripts, that there are some noises like,	no
27276	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	um, well the - good example was an inbreath, where a transcriber working from,	no
27277	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	the mixed,	no
27278	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	signal,	no
27279	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	doesn't know whose breath it is, and they've been assigning it to someone that may or may not be correct.	no
27280	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
27281	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And what we do is, if it's a breath sound, you know, a sound from the speaker, we map it,	no
27282	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	to,	no
27283	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	a noise model, like a mouth-noise model in the recognizer, and,	no
27284	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	yeah, it probably doesn't hurt that much once in a while to have these, but,	no
27285	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	if they're in the wrong channel, that's,	no
27286	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	not a good idea.	no
27287	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And then there's also,	no
27288	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	things like door-slams that's really in no one's channel, they're like -	no
27289	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	it's in the room.	no
27290	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
27291	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
27292	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And  uh, Jane had this nice, uh,	no
27293	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	idea of having,	no
27294	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	like an extra,	no
27295	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	An extra channel.	no
27296	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh couple tiers, yeah.	no
27297	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah. I've been - I've been adding that to the ones I've been editing.	no
27298	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And we were thinking,	no
27299	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	that is useful also when there's uncertainties. So if they hear a breath and they don't know who breath it is it's better to put it in that channel than to put it in the speaker's channel because maybe it was someone else's breath, or -	no
27300	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Uh, so I think that's a good - you can always clean that up, post-processing.	no
27301	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
27302	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So a lot of little details, but I think we're,	no
27303	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	coming to some kinda closure,	no
27304	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	on that. So the idea is then,	no
27305	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh, Don can take,	no
27306	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh, Jane's post-processed channelized version,	no
27307	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	and,	no
27308	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	with some scripts, you know, convert that to -	no
27309	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	to a reference for the recognizer and we can,	no
27310	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	can run these.	no
27311	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So  when that's,	no
27312	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	ready - you know, as soon as that's ready, and as soon as the recognizer is here we can get,	no
27313	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	twelve hours of force-aligned and recognized data.	no
27314	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And, you know,	no
27315	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	start,	no
27316	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	working on it, so we're,	no
27317	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And -	no
27318	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I dunno a coup- a week or two away I would say from,	no
27319	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh, if - if that process is automatic once we get your post-process,	no
27320	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	transcript.	no
27321	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Mm-hmm.	no
27322	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And that doesn't - the amount of editing that it would require is not very much either. I'm just  hoping  that the units that are provided in that way,	no
27323	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	will be sufficient cuz I would save a lot of, uh,	no
27324	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	time,	no
27325	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	dividing things.	no
27326	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah, some of them are quite long.	no
27327	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Just from - I dunno how long were - you did one?	no
27328	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I saw a couple,  around twenty seconds,	no
27329	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	and that was just without looking too hard for it, so,	no
27330	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
27331	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Well n-	no
27332	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I would imagine that there might be some that are longer.	no
27333	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	One question, e- w- would that be a single speaker or is that multiple speakers overlapping?	no
27334	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	No.	no
27335	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	No, but if we're gonna segment it, like if there's one speaker in there,	no
27336	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	"that says ""O_K"" or something,"	no
27337	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	right in the middle, it's gonna have a lot of dead time  around  it, so it's not -	no
27338	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right. It's not the -	no
27339	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	it's not the fact that we can't process a twenty second segment, it's the fact that,	no
27340	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	there's twenty seconds in which to place one word in the wrong place-	no
27341	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
27342	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	You know, if -	no
27343	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
27344	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	if someone has a very short utterance there, and that's where,	no
27345	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	we,	no
27346	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	might wanna have this individual, you know,	no
27347	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yep.	no
27348	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	ha- have your pre- pre-process input.	no
27349	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
27350	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Sure.	no
27351	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I - I - I thought that perhaps the transcribers could start then from the - those mult- multi-channel,	no
27352	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And I just don't know, I have to run it.	no
27353	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	That's very important.	no
27354	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh, speech-nonspeech detections, if they would like to.	no
27355	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
27356	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	In - in doing the hand-marking? Yeah that's what I was thinking, too.	no
27357	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
27358	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
27359	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So that's probably what will happen, but we'll try it this way and see.	no
27360	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
27361	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
27362	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I mean it's probably good enough for force-alignment.	no
27363	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	If it's not then we're really -	no
27364	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	then we def- definitely	no
27365	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
27366	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh, but for free recognition I'm - it'll probably not be good enough. We'll probably get lots of errors because of the cross-talk, and,	no
27367	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yep.	no
27368	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	noises and things.	no
27369	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Good  s- I think that's	no
27370	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	probably our agenda, or starting up there.	no
27371	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Oh I wanted to ask one thing,	yes
27372	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	probably our agenda, or starting up there.	no
27373	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Oh I wanted to ask one thing,	no
27374	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah?	no
27375	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	the microphones - the new microphones, when do we get, uh?	no
27376	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Uh, they said it would take about a week.	no
27377	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Oh, exciting.	no
27378	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	K_.	no
27379	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	K_.	no
27380	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	You ordered  them   already?	no
27381	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Mm-hmm.	no
27382	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Great.	no
27383	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So what happens to our old microphones?	no
27384	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	They go where old microphones go.	no
27385	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Um -	no
27386	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Do we give them to someone,  or - ?	no
27387	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Well the only thing we're gonna have extra,	no
27388	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	We don't have more  receivers,  we just have -	no
27389	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	for now,	no
27390	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right, we don- so the only thing we'll have extra now is just the lapel.	no
27391	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
27392	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Not - not the,	no
27393	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	bodypack,	no
27394	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	just the lapel.	no
27395	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Just the lapel itself.	no
27396	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Um, and then one of the - one of those.	no
27397	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Since, what I decided to do, on Morgan's suggestion, was just get two,	no
27398	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	new microphones,	no
27399	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	um, and try them out.	no
27400	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Mm-hmm.	no
27401	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And then, if we  like  them we'll get more.	no
27402	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K.	no
27403	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
27404	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Since they're - they're like two hundred bucks a piece, we won't, uh,	no
27405	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	at least try  them   out.	no
27406	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So it's a replacement for this headset mike?	no
27407	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yep.	no
27408	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yep.	no
27409	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
27410	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And they're gonna do the wiring for us.	no
27411	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	What's the, um, style of the headset?	no
27412	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	It's, um,	no
27413	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	it's by Crown, and it's one of these sort of mount around the ear thingies,	no
27414	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	and,	no
27415	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	uh, when I s- when I  mentioned  that we thought it was uncomfortable he said it was a common problem with the Sony.	no
27416	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And this is how apparently a lot of people are getting around it.	no
27417	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Hmm.	no
27418	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And I checked on the web, and  every  site I went to,	no
27419	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	raved about this particular mike.	no
27420	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	It's apparently comfortable and stays on the head well, so we'll see if it's any good.	no
27421	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	But, uh,	no
27422	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	I think it's promising.	no
27423	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	You said it was used by aerobics instructors?	no
27424	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yep.	no
27425	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yep, so it was -	no
27426	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Hmm.	no
27427	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	That says a lot.	no
27428	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	it was advertised for performers and -	no
27429	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	For the recor- for the record Adam is not a paid employee or a consultant of Crown.	no
27430	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Excuse me?	no
27431	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Oh.	no
27432	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Excuse me?	no
27433	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
27434	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	"I said ""For the record Adam is - is not a  paid  consultant or employee of Crown""."	no
27435	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	That's right.	no
27436	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	However, he may be solicited after these meetings are distributed.	no
27437	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Well we're using the Crown P_Z_Ms. These are Crown aren't they?	no
27438	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Don't worry about finishing your dissertation.	no
27439	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
27440	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Right.	no
27441	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	The P_Z_Ms  are   Crown,  aren't they?	no
27442	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah.	no
27443	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yeah, I thought they were.	no
27444	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	You bet. You bet.	no

27446	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Yes.	no
27447	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	So if we go to a workshop about all this - this it's gonna be a meeting about meetings about meetings.	no
27448	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	O_K.  So.	no
27449	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	And then it - we have to go to the planning session for that workshop.	no
27450	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Oh, yeah, what - Which'll be the meeting about the meeting about the meeting. Yeah?	no
27451	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Oh, god.	no
27452	transcript	transcript_Bmr013	Cuz then it would be a meeting about the meeting about the meeting about meetings.	no

27624	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	This is - chan-	no
27625	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	For people wearing the wireless mikes, like - like this one, I find the easiest way to wear it is sorta this - this sorta like that. It's actually a lot more comfortable then if you try to put it over your temples, so -	no

27633	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Adam's just trying to generate good uh data for the recognizer there.	no
27634	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah, I think we're supposed to - that's right.	no
27635	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Oh it was.	no
27636	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	And then also, for - for all of them, if your boom is adjustable, the boom should be towards the corner of your mouth, and about a- uh a thumb to a thumb and a half distance away from your mouth, so about like I'm wearing it now.	no
27637	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Test test.	no
27638	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	By the way, there was a bug. Yeah, i- it wasn't using the proper  basically it wasn't adapting anything.	no
27639	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Oh.  Oh that's interesting. So why didn't you get the same results and the unadapted?	no
27640	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	It's not always possible.	no
27641	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	so- so Jane, you could actually do even a little closer to your mouth, but -	no
27642	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Hmm?	no
27643	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I could - can this be adjuste- like this? Is that  @@ ? O_K, thank you.	no
27644	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Why didn't you get the same results and the unadapted?	no
27645	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Oh, because when it estimates the transformer pro- produces like a single matrix or something.	no
27646	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yep.	no

27650	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Channel five, s- speak again. Yeah, that's alright. I mean, we could - we could up the gain slightly if you wanted to.	no
27651	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Hello.	no
27652	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Basically there were no counts  @@	no
27653	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.  O_K.	no

27672	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K.	no
27673	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Um everyone should have at least two forms possibly three in front of you depending on who you are.	no
27674	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Um we - we're doing a new speaker form and you only have to spea- fill out the speaker form once but everyone does need to do it.	no
27675	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	And so that's the name, sex, email, et cetera.	no
27676	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Mm-hmm.	no
27677	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	We - we had a lot of discussion about the variety of English and so on so	no
27678	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	if you don't know what to put just leave it blank.	no
27679	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Um	no
27680	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I - I designed the form and I don't know what to put for my own region,  so	no
27681	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Mmm.	no
27682	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	California.	no
27683	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I think -	no
27684	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	California.	no
27685	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	California.	no
27686	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Um may I make one suggestion? Instead of age put date of - uh year of birth because age will change, but	no
27687	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Sure.	no
27688	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Oh.	no
27689	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	The year of birth changes, you know, stays the same, usually.	no
27690	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Although on -	no
27691	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	A- actually, wait a minute, shouldn't it be the other way around?	no
27692	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Birth year?	no
27693	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Not for me.	no
27694	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
27695	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	course on the other - on the other hand you could -	no
27696	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	On the other side, yeah.	no
27697	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	you view it as the age at the time of the -	no
27698	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well the thing is, if ten years from now you look at this form knowing that -	no
27699	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yes, but what we care about is the age at - at the recording date rather than the -	no
27700	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	But there's no other date on the form.	no
27701	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O- yeah.	no
27702	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	W- we don't care how they - old they really are.	no
27703	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well - well I don't know.	no
27704	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yes.  Unless we wanna send them a card.	no
27705	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well I guess it depends on how long the corpus is gonna be collected for.	no
27706	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Anyway.	no
27707	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah, that's true.	no
27708	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I still don't see the problem.	no
27709	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Either way	no
27710	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	yeah I think - I think age is alright and then	no
27711	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K.	no
27712	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	If you have the date  @@ .	no
27713	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	um there will be attached to this a point or two these forms	no
27714	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Mm-hmm.	no
27715	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	uh so that you'll be able to extract the date off that	no
27716	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	so, anyway.	no
27717	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	And so then you also have a digits form	no
27718	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	which needs to be filled out every time, the speaker form only once, the digit form every time even if you don't read the digits you have to fill out the digits form so that we know that you were at the meeting.	no
27719	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K? And then also if you haven't filled one out already you do have to fill out a consent form.	no
27720	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	And that should just be one person whose name I don't know.	no
27721	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K?	no
27722	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Do you want this  Adam?	no
27723	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Uh sure.	no
27724	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Thank you.	no
27725	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So uh	yes
27726	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So uh	no
27727	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K so	no
27728	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	should we do agenda items?	no
27729	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Uh oh that's a good idea.	no
27730	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I shouldn't run the meeting.	no
27731	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Uh well I have - I wanna talk about new microphones and wireless stuff.	no
27732	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Mmm.	no
27733	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	And I'm sure	no
27734	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Liz and Andreas wanna talk about recognition results.	no
27735	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Anything else?	no
27736	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I guess - what time do we have to leave?	no
27737	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Three thirty?	no
27738	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
27739	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Why don't you go first then.	no
27740	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah, so.	yes
27741	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Three thirty?	no
27742	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
27743	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Why don't you go first then.	no
27744	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah, so.	no
27745	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah, good idea.	no
27746	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K.	no
27747	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Um	no
27748	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well, I - I sent out an email	no
27749	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	s- couple hours ago so	no
27750	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	um	no
27751	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	with Andreas' help um Andreas put together a sort of no frills recognizer which is uh	no
27752	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	gender-dependent but like no adaptation, no cross-word models, no trigrams - a bigram recognizer	no
27753	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	and that's trained on Switchboard which is telephone conversations.	no
27754	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Um	no
27755	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	and thanks to Don's help wh- who - Don took	no
27756	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	the first meeting that Jane had transcribed	no
27757	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	and um  you know separated - used the individual channels we segmented it in- into the segments that Jane had used	no
27758	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	and uh Don sampled that so -	no
27759	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	so eight K_	no
27760	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	um and then we ran up to I guess the first twenty minutes, up to synch time of one two zero zero  so is that - that's twenty minutes or so?	no
27761	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Um yeah because I guess there's some, and Don can talk to Jane about this, there's some bug in the actual synch time file that	no
27762	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Or so.	no
27763	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	ah uh I'm - we're not sure where it came from but stuff after that was a little messier.	no
27764	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Anyway so it's twenty minutes and I actually um	no
27765	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Hmm.	no
27766	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I -	no
27767	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	was that - did that - did that recording have the glitch in the middle?	no
27768	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I'm puzzled by that.	no
27769	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I - oh - oh, I see. Oh there was a glitch somewhere.	no
27770	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	There's - there's a -	no
27771	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	yeah, so that actually um	no
27772	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Was it twenty minutes in, I thought -	no
27773	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I forgot about that.	no
27774	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	if it was twenty minutes in then I don't know	no
27775	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well it was interesting, suddenly -	no
27776	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well, I mean, they - but I was able to can- transcribe	no
27777	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I don't remember when it is.	no
27778	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	the - the overall error rate when we first ran it was like eighty percent	no
27779	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	but i- looking at - the first sentences looked much better than that	no
27780	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	and then suddenly it turned very bad and then we noticed that the	no
27781	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	reference was always one off with the -  it was actually recognized so	no
27782	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah, that might be - that might be - that might be my fault. I'm not -	no
27783	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Oh no.	no
27784	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Wel-	no
27785	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Wow.	no
27786	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Oh so that was just a parsing	no
27787	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K.	no
27788	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	No actually it was -	no
27789	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	mismatch.	no
27790	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	yeah i- it was a complicated bug because they were sometimes one off and then sometimes totally random so	no
27791	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Oh.	no
27792	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	yeah, I was pretty certain that it worked up until that time, so	no
27793	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	That's not good.	no
27794	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	um	no
27795	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah so that's what we have but that - that will be completely gone if this synch time problem	no
27796	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K.	no
27797	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Alright.	no
27798	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
27799	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	The -	no
27800	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So - so we have everything recognized but we scored only the first uh whatever, up to that time to	no
27801	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	And the only glitch -	no
27802	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	the glitch	no
27803	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	yeah.	no
27804	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	yeah.	no
27805	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So you guys know.	no
27806	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
27807	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	S-	no
27808	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Th- the	no
27809	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	The - the -	no
27810	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	sorry I haven't seen the email, what was the score?	no
27811	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So here's the  actual   copy of the email um	no
27812	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	well -	no
27813	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	wait we should say something about the glitch. He - he can say something about the glitch. Cuz it's - it's - it's - h- it's - it's very small - very small.	no
27814	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	yeah.	no
27815	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	oh O_K so does this glitch occur at other -	no
27816	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	There -	no
27817	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	there - there's an acoustic glitch that occurs where um the channels get slightly asynchronized	no
27818	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yep.	no
27819	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Oh.	no
27820	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Mmm.	no
27821	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Right.	no
27822	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	so the - that - that problem has gone away in the original driver	no
27823	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	believe it or not when the S_S_H key gen ran the driver paused for a fraction of a second	no
27824	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Hmm.	no
27825	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Hmm.	no
27826	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	and so the channels get a little asynchronous and so if you listen to it in the middle there's a little part where it starts doing - doing click sounds.	no
27827	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	And is it only once that that happens?	no
27828	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So -	no
27829	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	But	no
27830	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	yeah it - right once in the middle.	no
27831	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K.	no
27832	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	There's - the previous page has some more information about sort of what was wrong but	no
27833	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	so -	no
27834	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	so un- unsurprisingly Adam is the golden voice, you see this here?	no
27835	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Um	no
27836	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	S-	no
27837	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K so that's actually	no
27838	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	and it -	no
27839	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	But that shouldn't affect anything	no
27840	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	"yeah yeah ""bah"""	no
27841	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	It - y- it's - O_K no -	no
27842	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Oh, and -	no
27843	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	What happens is it actually affects the script that Don - I mean if we know about it then I guess it could always be checked for it but they	no
27844	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Huh.	no
27845	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well the acoustic one shouldn't do anything.	no
27846	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I agree. I agree.	no
27847	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah, I don't know exactly what affected it but I'll - I'll talk to you about it, I'll show you the point.	no
27848	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I - I have -	no
27849	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	But	no
27850	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah. It - it had no effect on my transcription, you know, I mean I - I had no trouble hearing it and - and having time bins but	no
27851	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
27852	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
27853	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I - I do remember -	no
27854	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Mmm.	no
27855	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I do remember seeing once the transcriber produce an incorrect X_M_L file where one of the synch numbers was incorrect.	no
27856	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	there was a -	no
27857	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Oh.	no
27858	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	That's what happened.	no
27859	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well, the - the synch time - the synch numbers have more significant digits than they should, right? There's things that are l- in smaller increments than a frame.	no
27860	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
27861	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Oh.	no
27862	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	There was -	no
27863	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Where - where they weren't monotonic.	no
27864	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	yeah, I mean -	no
27865	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
27866	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Oh, interesting.	no
27867	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Oh O_K so that's	no
27868	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	And so then, I mean you look at that and it's got you know more than three significant digits in a synch time then that can't be right so	no
27869	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Hmm.	no
27870	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Oh. Yeah.	no
27871	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	yeah sounds like a bug.	no
27872	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Mmm.	no
27873	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	anyway it's - it's just - that's why we only have twenty minutes but there's a significant	no
27874	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Non-zero?	no
27875	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	amount of -	no
27876	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Um there are like more -	no
27877	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	The other one I saw was that it	no
27878	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	cuz there's a lot of zeros I tacked on just because of the way the script ran, I mean but there were- there was a point.	no
27879	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	yeah.	no
27880	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah that was fine. That - that was O_K.	no
27881	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	The other one I saw was non- non-monotonic synch times and that definitely indicra- indicates a bug.	no
27882	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K.	no
27883	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Uh.	no
27884	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well that would really be a problem, yeah. So anyway these are just the ones that are the prebug	no
27885	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
27886	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	for one meeting.	no
27887	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Hmm.	no
27888	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	um and what's -	no
27889	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So that's very encouraging.	no
27890	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	which - this is really encouraging cuz this is free recognition, there's no	no
27891	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
27892	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Cool.	no
27893	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Mmm.	no
27894	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I mean the language model for Switchboard is totally different so you can see some like	no
27895	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Trent Lott.	no
27896	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	this Trent Lott which um I mean these are sort of funny ones, there's a lot of perfect ones and good ones and all the references, I mean you can read them and	no
27897	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	It'll get those though.	no
27898	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	when we get more results you can look through and see but	no
27899	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I	no
27900	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Mm-hmm.	no
27901	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	and as I said I would like to look at the lattices because it sounded like even the ones it got wrong it sort of got it right?	no
27902	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	um it's pretty good.	no
27903	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well so I guess we can generate	no
27904	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Sounds likes?	no
27905	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Mm-hmm.	no
27906	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	There are a fair number of errors that are, you know where - got the plural S_ wrong or the inflection on the verb wrong.	no
27907	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	um	no
27908	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	"Yeah, and who cares? And - and there were lots of - of course the ""uh uh""-s, ""in on""-s"	no
27909	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Mmm, so if -	no
27910	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	there's -	no
27911	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	No those are actually	no
27912	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	"""of uh""-s."	no
27913	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
27914	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	a lot of the errors I think are out of vocabulary, so is it like P_Z_M is three words, it's P_Z_M, I mean there's nothing	no
27915	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Mm-hmm.	no
27916	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Mm-hmm.	no
27917	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Right.	no
27918	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	There's no language model for P_Z_M	no
27919	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Ri- ri- right.	no
27920	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	or um	no
27921	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Did you say there's no language for P_Z_M?	no
27922	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	No language model, I mean those -	no
27923	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Do you mean - so every time someone says P_Z_M it's an error?	no
27924	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Maybe we shouldn't say P_Z_M in these meetings.	no
27925	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well - well there's all kinds of other stuff like Jimlet and	no
27926	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah, that's right, Jimlet.	no
27927	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I mean	no
27928	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	um anyway there -	no
27929	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well, we don't even know what that means, so I	no
27930	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	so  but this is really encouraging because	no
27931	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah, that's right.	no
27932	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	so, I mean the bottom line is even though it's not a huge amount of data	no
27933	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	um	no
27934	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	it should be	no
27935	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	uh reasonable to actually run recognition and be like within the scope of -	no
27936	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	of r- reasonable s- you know Switchboard this is like h- about how well we do	no
27937	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	on Switchboard-two data with the Switchboard-one trained - mostly trained recognizer and  Switchboard-two   is -	no
27938	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Right.	no
27939	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Excellent.	no
27940	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	got sort of a different population of speakers	no
27941	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	and a different topic and they're talking about things in the news that happened after Switchboard-one so there was  @@  so that's great.	no
27942	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
27943	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah so we're in better shape than we were say when we did - had the ninety-three workshop	no
27944	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Um	no
27945	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	and we were all getting like seventy percent error on Switchboard.	no
27946	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Mm-hmm.	no
27947	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Oh yeah I mean this is really, and thanks to Andreas who, I mean this is a	no
27948	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	you know	no
27949	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Mmm.	no
27950	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well	no
27951	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Mmm.	no
27952	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
27953	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	especially for the very first run, I mean	no
27954	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Oh it's the -	no
27955	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	eh um	no
27956	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	yeah	no
27957	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
27958	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	you - the first run I ran of Switchboard I got a hundred twenty percent word error but	no
27959	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So and what al- also this means is that um	no
27960	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Right.	no
27961	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Not Switchboard, uh Broadcast News.	no
27962	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well it's -	no
27963	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I mean there's a bunch of things in this note to various people especially I guess	no
27964	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	um with Jane that - that would help for - since we have this new data now	no
27965	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	uh in order to go from the transcripts	no
27966	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	more easily to	no
27967	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	um just the words that the recognizer would use for scoring.	no
27968	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I had to deal with some of it by hand but I think a lot of it	no
27969	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	can be automated s- by -	no
27970	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Oh one thing I guess I didn't get so	no
27971	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	you know the language model was straight from - from bigram from Switchboard	no
27972	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	the acoustic models were also from Switchboard or - or	no
27973	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
27974	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
27975	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	That's amazing.	no
27976	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So they didn't have anything from this acoustic data in yet? O_K.	no
27977	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah, so that's great.	no
27978	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	No.	no
27979	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	And actually - we actually um used Switchboard telephone bandwidth models	no
27980	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	That's amazing.	no
27981	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I was just gonna say, yeah.	no
27982	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	which I guess	no
27983	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
27984	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well that's - those are the only we- ones there are, I mean	no
27985	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	so that's the on- that's the only acoustic training data that we have a lot of and I guess  Ramana , so a guy at S_R_I said that	no
27986	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
27987	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Right.	no
27988	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	um there's not a huge amount of difference	no
27989	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	going from - it's - it's not like we probably lose a huge amount but we won't know because we don't have any full band models for s- conversational speech.	no
27990	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Right.	no
27991	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	It's probably not as bad as going f- using full band models on	no
27992	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So.	no
27993	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	telephone band speech right?	no
27994	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Oh yeah. Yeah.	no
27995	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Right. Right, so it's - so	no
27996	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah, but for Broadcast News when we - we played around between the two there wasn't a huge	no
27997	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Right, it was not a big deal.	no
27998	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah so I wou- so that's good.	no
27999	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I should - I should say that -	no
28000	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	loss.	no
28001	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Although combining em worked well.	no
28002	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	the language model is not just Switchboard it's also -	no
28003	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I mean there's uh	no
28004	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	actually more data is from Broadcast News but with a little less weight	no
28005	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
28006	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Uh-huh.	no
28007	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Like Trent Lott must have been from  I  guess  Switchboard was before uh.	no
28008	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	uh because	no
28009	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	mm-hmm, right.	no
28010	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Um	no
28011	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	By the way just -	no
28012	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Good point.	no
28013	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	for fun we also ran, I mean our complete system starts by doing ge- a gender detection	no
28014	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Mm-hmm.	no
28015	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	so just for the heck of it I ran that	no
28016	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	And it said a hundred percent male?	no
28017	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	um and it might be reassuring for everybody to know that it got all the genders right. Yeah so  Yeah. Yes.	no
28018	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	The j-	no
28019	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Oh it did?	no
28020	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Oh that's - I'm glad.	no
28021	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	It got all two genders?	no
28022	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah	no
28023	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	but you know Jane and Adam have you kn- about equal performance and uh	no
28024	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	and that's interesting cuz I think the - their language models are quite different so	no
28025	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	and I - I'm pretty sure from listening to Eric	no
28026	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	that, you know given the words he was saying and given his pronunciation that the reason that he's so much worse	no
28027	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	is the lapel.	no
28028	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Right.	no
28029	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	That makes a lot of sense, yeah.	no
28030	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
28031	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So it's nice now if we can just sort of eliminate the lapel one when -	no
28032	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Very possible.	no
28033	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah I - I - I would bet on that too cuz he certainly in that - when as a - as a burp user he was - he was a pretty uh strong one.	no
28034	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	when we get new microphones that would be worth it um	no
28035	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Sheep.	no
28036	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah he - he - he sounded to me just from - he sounded like a, what's it a sheep or a goat?	no
28037	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
28038	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	A sheep. Baah.	no
28039	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Sheep.	no
28040	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Sheep, right.	no
28041	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah. Sheep is good.	no
28042	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Sounded good.	no
28043	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
28044	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Right so um	no
28045	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Mm-hmm.	no
28046	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	so I guess the good news is that	no
28047	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	and - and again this is without	no
28048	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	a lot of the sort of bells and whistles that we c- can do with the S_R_I system	no
28049	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	and we'll have more data and we can also start to	no
28050	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	maybe adapt the language models once we have enough meetings. So this is only twenty minutes of one meeting with no - no	no
28051	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I mean clearly there are um with just a small amount of uh actual	no
28052	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	tailoring at all.	no
28053	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	meeting transcriptions uh thrown into the language model you can probably do quite a bit better because	no
28054	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
28055	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Or just dictionary.	no
28056	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	the -	no
28057	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	The voca- the vocabulary especially yeah.	no
28058	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah, so.	no
28059	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Not that much the vocabulary actually I think - um well we have to see but -	no
28060	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
28061	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	it's uh -	no
28062	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	It's pretty good um	no
28063	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Have to add P_Z_M and so on but	no
28064	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	so then	no
28065	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	And I have to try it on the far field mike yeah.	no
28066	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	P_Z_M and then there's things like	no
28067	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	for the transcription I got when someone has a digit in the transcript I don't know if they said, you know one one or eleven and I don't know if they said	no
28068	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Tcl   or T_C_L.	no
28069	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	there's things like that where, you know the	no
28070	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	um we'll probably have to ask the transcribers to indicate some of those kinds of things but	no
28071	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	in general it was really good and I'm hoping - and this is -	no
28072	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	this is good news because that means the force alignments should be good and if the force alignments, I mean it's good news anyway but if the force alignments are good we can get all kinds of information.	no
28073	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	For example about, you know prosodic information and speaker overlaps and so forth directly from the aligned times.	no
28074	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Um so that'll be something that	no
28075	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	actually in order to assess the forced alignment	no
28076	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	um we need s- some linguists or some people to look at it and say are these boundaries in about the right place.	no
28077	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Because it's just gonna give us time marks so.	no
28078	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	But you know -	no
28079	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well we've done that for one meeting.	no
28080	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	For forced alignment.	no
28081	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Uh oh oh f- not for words I'm sorry just for overlaps is we did it for not - not for words.	no
28082	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Ye- right.	no
28083	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Right.	no
28084	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So this would be like if you take the words	no
28085	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	um you know and force align them on all the individual close talk uh close talking mikes	no
28086	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	then how good are these sort of in reality and then I was thinking it -	no
28087	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Right.	no
28088	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So we might want to take twenty minutes and do a closer word level transcription.	no
28089	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Maybe actually mark the word boundaries.	no
28090	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Oh or - i- have someone look at the alignments uh maybe a linguist who can say	no
28091	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	um	no
28092	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	you know roughly if these are O_K and how far away they are.	no
28093	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
28094	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Um but I think it's gotta be pretty good because otherwise the word recognition would be really b- crummy.	no
28095	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Right, right.	no
28096	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	It wouldn't necessarily be the other way around, if the wor- word recognition was crummy the alignment might be O_K	no
28097	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	but if the word recognition is this good	no
28098	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	the alignment should be pretty good.	no
28099	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So	no
28100	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	that's about it.	no
28101	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I wonder if this is a good thing or a bad thing though, I mean if we're pr-	no
28102	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I r-	no
28103	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	That we're starting so well?	no
28104	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	yeah if we're producing a database that everybody's gonna do well on	no
28105	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Oh	no
28106	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Don't worry about it w- d- that's	no
28107	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	that's the close talking mikes. Try it on the P_Z_Ms and - and	no
28108	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah, which - I would - which - well n- n- n- n-	no
28109	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.	no
28110	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So the real value of the database is  these?	no
28111	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah, abso- well no but	no
28112	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I mean there's still just the w- the percentages and, I mean they're not - a- as we've talked about before there's probably overlaps	no
28113	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	This i- yeah. This is not that good.	no
28114	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	there's probably overlaps in - in	no
28115	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	uh in fair number in Switchboard as well so	no
28116	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	but -	no
28117	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	but there's other phenomena, it's a meeting, it's a different thing and there's lots of stuff to learn with the close talking mikes	no
28118	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	but uh yeah certainly I'd like to see as soon as we could, I mean maybe	no
28119	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	get some of the glitches out of the way but soon as we could how well it does with say	no
28120	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	with the P_Z_Ms or maybe even one of the	no
28121	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Right.	no
28122	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	and uh see if it's, you know is it a hundred twenty percent or maybe it's not maybe if	no
28123	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	with some adaptation you get this down to fifty percent or forty-five percent or something and - and then if for the P_Z_M it's seventy or something like that that's actually something we could sort of	no
28124	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	work with a little bit	no
28125	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah. No I think it's really, I mean this way we least have a baseline we know that for instance the transcripts are very good so once you can get to the words that the recognizer which is a total subset of the things you need to understand the - the text	no
28126	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	so	no
28127	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	um yeah they're pretty good so and - and it's	no
28128	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	converting automatically from the X_M_L to the	no
28129	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	chopping up the wave forms and so forth it's not the case that	no
28130	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	the end of one	no
28131	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	utterance is in the next segment and things like that which we had more problems with in Switchboard	no
28132	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	so that's good.	no
28133	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	And um	no
28134	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	let's see there was one more thing I wanted to -	no
28135	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	to mention - I can't remember um	no
28136	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Sorry can't remember.	no
28137	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	anyway it's - well it was, I mean I really didn't do this myself so Andreas set up this recognizer and - by the way the recognizer all the files I'm moving to S_R_I and running everything there so	no
28138	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Congratulations	no
28139	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
28140	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	is really great.	no
28141	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah, it's really good.	no
28142	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I brought back just these result files and people can look at them um	no
28143	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	so	no
28144	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	We - we talked about setting up the	no
28145	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	S_R_I recognizer here.	no
28146	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	That's -	no
28147	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	you know if - if there are more machines	no
28148	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	um	no
28149	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	uh here plus people can - could	no
28150	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	run their own	no
28151	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	uh you know variants of - of - of the recognition  runs um certainly doable.	no
28152	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Um.	no
28153	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah and - well certainly if the recognition as opposed to training, yeah.	no
28154	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Seems reasonable.	no
28155	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I need t- Hmm.	no
28156	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
28157	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I need to ask one question.	no
28158	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
28159	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Which is um	no
28160	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	so this issue	no
28161	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	of the uh legalistic aspects of the pre-sent- you know pre-adapted -	no
28162	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah, well, so what I mean is um	no
28163	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	the -	no
28164	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	uh the data that you take into S_R_I, first - first question, you're maintaining it in - in a place that wouldn't be publicly readable that - that kind of stuff, right?	no
28165	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	U- um	no
28166	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	From the outside world or	no
28167	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	By uh people uh who are not associated with this project.	no
28168	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	It's human subjects issues, I told you about that.	no
28169	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Oh.	no
28170	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Exactly.	no
28171	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Um oh. Well O_K we have n- no names.	no
28172	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Although I sh- um	no
28173	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	That - that's not the issue, it's just the audio data itself, until people have a chance to	no
28174	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	de- audio data itself?	no
28175	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Mm-hmm, exactly.	no
28176	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	edit it.	no
28177	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Uh so well I can - I can protect my directories through there. Right now they're not - they're in the speech group directories which - so I will - I didn't know that actually.	no
28178	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
28179	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Great.	no
28180	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah so we just have to go through this process of having people approve the transcriptions, say it's O_K.	no
28181	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah O_K.	no
28182	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah, we had to get them to approve em and then i- cuz - cuz the other question I was gonna ask is if we're having um you know it's	no
28183	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Right O_K.	no
28184	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	but this - this meeting that you have, no problem cuz I - I well I mean I - I speak for myself but - but I think that we didn't do anything that but	no
28185	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	It's us.	no
28186	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	well anyway so  uh I wouldn't be too concerned about it with respect to that although we should clear it with Eric and Dan of course but these results are based on data which haven't had the	no
28187	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	uh haven't had the chance to be reviewed by the subjects and I don't know how that stands, I mean if you - if you get fantastic results and it's involving  data which -	no
28188	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	That's true.	no
28189	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	which later end up being	no
28190	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	lessened by, you know certain elisions, then I don't know but I wanted to raise that issue, that's all.	no
28191	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well we, I mean once we get all this streamlined it may be sh- it - hopefully it will be fairly quick but	no
28192	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	we get the transcriptions, people approve them and so on it's just that we're	no
28193	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Alright we need to work at a system for doing that approval so that we can send people the transcripts and get back any bleeps that they want	no
28194	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Great.	no
28195	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Mmm.	no
28196	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
28197	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah actually the bleeps are also an issue I thought.	no
28198	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	It's gonna be a rare thing that there's a bleep for the most part.	no
28199	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	U- uh actually I had a question about the downsampling, um I don't know who, I mean how this was done but	no
28200	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Don did this.	no
28201	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	is -	no
28202	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	is there - are there any um	no
28203	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	issues with downsampling because I know that	no
28204	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	the recognizer	no
28205	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	um	no
28206	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	that we use h- can do it sort of on the fly um so we wouldn't have to have it eh you know do it uh	no
28207	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	explicitly beforehand.	no
28208	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	And is there any um i- are there other d- sev- uh-	no
28209	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	is there more than one way to do the downsampling where one might be better than another?	no
28210	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	There are lots of w-  there are lots of ways to do the downsampling um different filters to	no
28211	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K.	no
28212	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	put on, like anti-aliasing stuff.	no
28213	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Right.	no
28214	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K.	no
28215	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So - so the - th-	no
28216	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I don't think we even know which one	no
28217	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I assume you're using syncat to do it?	no
28218	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	No, I'm using uh S_N	no
28219	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Or sound resample?	no
28220	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	S_N_D uh	no
28221	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Re- re- ref- yeah.	no
28222	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Resample. Yeah and Dan's archaic acronyms.	no
28223	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	are resample.	no
28224	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	R_S_M_P.	no
28225	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah, I don't really.	no
28226	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Missing all the vowels.	no
28227	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I just - yeah I found it.	no
28228	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Not all of them.	no
28229	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Some of the vowels, almost all the vowels, that's the hard part.	no
28230	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So - so the other thing we should try is to just take the original wave forms, I mean segment them but not downsample them.	no
28231	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	And a few of the consonants.	no
28232	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah we could - we could try that and - and	no
28233	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah, that's -	no
28234	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	And - and feed them to - feed them to the S_R_I recognizer and see if - if the S_R_I front-end does something.	no
28235	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	compare	no
28236	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
28237	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I suspect that's sort of premature optimization, but	no
28238	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Sure.	no
28239	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	We can try it. I - I only downsampled them first cuz I was	no
28240	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I mean that's just one line - that's one line of code to comment at so	no
28241	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well -	no
28242	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	yeah	no
28243	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Right and - and it doesn't - is no more work  for um	no
28244	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Mm-hmm.	no
28245	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
28246	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well they're just bigger to transfer, that's why I s- downsampled them before but	no
28247	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	you know for us.	no
28248	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well but they're only twice as big so	no
28249	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well I mean that was - if it's the same then we can downsample here but if it's -	no
28250	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I mean it's - it's just a	no
28251	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Although those eighty meg files take a while to copy into my directories so, but no, I mean it's not - i- it wouldn't be a problem if you're interested in it - it would -	no
28252	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
28253	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	We could try that.	no
28254	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah I mean it would be uh you know it would probably take uh about um	no
28255	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	you know minus the transfer time it would - it would take uh	no
28256	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
28257	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	you know ten minutes to try and - and - and	no
28258	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	It's about a fifty minute drive, right?	no
28259	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well it takes more disk space too so I was just -	no
28260	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	And - and if for some reason we see that it works better then we might investigate why and, you know, what -	no
28261	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Mmm. In the front-end we could do that.	no
28262	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah. Yeah.	no
28263	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So you just train - just different filters and so you're just wondering whether the filter is	no
28264	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah, I -	no
28265	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah, I can imagine it would be -	no
28266	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Right. Right.	no
28267	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I mean I guess there's some -	no
28268	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So we could try that with this particular twenty minutes of speech and sort of see if there's any differences.	no
28269	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	You know a- at some point someone might have optimized whatever filtering is done for the actual recognition	no
28270	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Hmm.	no
28271	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	um performance.	no
28272	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So in other words	no
28273	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Right.	no
28274	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	right, so	no
28275	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	It just seems to me that, you know small changes to the language model and the vocabulary will so swamp that that it may be premature to worry about that.	no
28276	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I mean so one is a half a percent better than the other	no
28277	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I don't think that gives you any information.	no
28278	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well it's just as easy to - to give you the sixteen K_ individual, it was just more disk space you know for storing them so	no
28279	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yep.	no
28280	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Are you -	no
28281	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	are you using uh	no
28282	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	uh mel cepstrum or P_L_P over there?	no
28283	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Mel cepstrum.	no
28284	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So probably doesn't matter.	no
28285	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well we could try.  Could easily try	no
28286	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	There's - there's your answer.	no
28287	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	But - but it wouldn't hurt to try, yeah.	no
28288	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	That's what I would assume but you never know, you know.	no
28289	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	so	no
28290	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Sure.	no
28291	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Just - Mm-hmm.	no
28292	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	No the reason I say this P_L_P uses uh auto-regressive filtering and uh modeling and so	no
28293	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Mm-hmm.	no
28294	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	it can be sensitive to the kind of filtering that you're doing but uh uh mel cepstrum	no
28295	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	uh	no
28296	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	might not - b- you wouldn't expect to be so much but	no
28297	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well we can try it if you generate like the same set of files just up to that point where we stopped anyway and just sti- stick them somewhere and I'll rerun it with	no
28298	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah, it's - it's really not a problem.	no
28299	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Actually, no. Don't stop.  Don't stop at that part because	no
28300	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Keep going.	no
28301	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	we're actually using the entire conversation to estimate the speaker parameters, so	no
28302	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
28303	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	shouldn't use - you should s- you know, get  @@	no
28304	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah, I mean I'll - I have to do is eh e- the reference file would stay the same, it's just the individual segments would be approximately twice as long and I could just replace them with the bigger ones in the directory, that's not a problem.	no
28305	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K.	no
28306	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
28307	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Right.	no
28308	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Mmm.	no
28309	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Right.	no
28310	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Right.	no
28311	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
28312	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Right.	no
28313	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I mean I corrected all - I mean I hand-edited the whole - the whole meeting so that can be run it's just -	no
28314	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Once we get the - the bug out.	no
28315	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Mmm.	no
28316	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	One - one question which is I - I had the impression  from this - from this meeting	no
28317	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
28318	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Mm-hmm.	no
28319	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	that w- that I transcribed that	no
28320	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	um that there was already automatic downsampling occurring, is that	no
28321	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I thought that in order to	no
28322	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yep.	no
28323	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	so it was -	no
28324	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	There's one level that's already happening right here.	no
28325	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	so it's like there's already down	no
28326	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K.	no
28327	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	This is being recorded at forty-eight kilohertz.	no
28328	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Oh.	no
28329	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Right. And it gets downsampled to sixteen.	no
28330	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K.	no
28331	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Which is more that anybody needs so	no
28332	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	And that's actually said in your meeting, that's how I know that.  I - I  It's like are we downsampling to sixteen?	no
28333	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Hmm.	no
28334	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Oh O_K.	no
28335	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	That's exactly, and that's how I know it.	no
28336	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
28337	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	It's a digital audio orientation for the board it's in the monitor so it's	no
28338	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Right.	no
28339	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Mmm.	no
28340	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Thank God it's not  more than that.	no
28341	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So -	no
28342	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Is eight kilohertz -	no
28343	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
28344	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	And I have no idea what filter it's using, so	no
28345	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	is - is eighty kilohertz generally accepted as like standard for voice?	no
28346	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Telephone.	no
28347	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	For telephone stuff.	no
28348	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Telephone.	no
28349	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah that's what I was gonna say, I mean like -	no
28350	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	so	no
28351	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So it's - it's - it's just that	no
28352	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	they were operating from Switchboard which was a completely telephone database and so that was a standard for that	no
28353	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Oh, I see, so. O_K.	no
28354	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So sixteen seems to be pretty typical for	no
28355	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	sixteen s-	no
28356	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Right.	no
28357	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Sixteen is more common for - for uh	no
28358	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	with this sort of thing.	no
28359	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	broadband stuff that isn't -	no
28360	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	That isn't music.	no
28361	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	that isn't music and isn't telephone, yeah.	no
28362	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	And I guess if you're comparing like -	no
28363	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	uh if you wanna run recognition on the P_Z_M stuff you would want	no
28364	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	you don't want to downsample the wh- that right?	no
28365	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Why is that?	no
28366	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I don't know.	no
28367	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well I don- I mean if it's any better	no
28368	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	No actually I would think that you would - you would get better - you'd get better high frequencies in the local mike.	no
28369	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	All the way around I'd think.	no
28370	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Uh but who knows? I mean we do-  we - we - we - we - we wanna find all this stuff out, we don't know.	no
28371	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah well we could try it.	no
28372	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
28373	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	We're gonna have plenty of low frequency on the P_Z_Ms with the fans.	no
28374	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K.	no
28375	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
28376	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Uh yeah.	no
28377	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
28378	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Oh yeah there was just one more thing I wanted to say which is totally unrelated to the recognition except that um	yes
28379	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
28380	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Oh yeah there was just one more thing I wanted to say which is totally unrelated to the recognition except that um	no
28381	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	well -	no
28382	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	well it's sort of related but um good news also	no
28383	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	uh I got - well Chuck Fillmore agreed to record meetings but he had too many people in his meetings and that's too bad cuz they're very animated and	no
28384	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	but uh Jerry also agreed so uh we're starting on - on	no
28385	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	They're less animated.	no
28386	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well but he has fewer - he - he won't have more than eight and it's a meeting on even deeper understanding, E_D_U, so that sounds interesting. As a compliment to our front-end meeting	no
28387	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Dot E_D_U?	no
28388	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	and um so that's gonna start Monday and one of the things that I was realizing is um	no
28389	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	it would be really great if anyone has any ideas on some kind of	no
28390	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	time synchronous way that people in the meeting can make a comment to the person whose gonna transcribe it	no
28391	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	or - or put a	no
28392	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	push a button or something	no
28393	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	"when they wanna make a note about ""oh boy you should probably erase those last few"" or"	no
28394	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	"uh ""wait I want this not to be recorded now"" or"	no
28395	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Weren't we gonna	no
28396	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	uh something like that s-	no
28397	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	do something with a pad at one point?	no
28398	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	The cross pads?	no
28399	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah, we could do it with the cross pads.	no
28400	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Cuz I was thinking you know if - if the person who sets up the meeting isn't there and it's a group that we don't know	no
28401	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	"um and this came up talking to - to Jerry also that you know is there any way for them to indicate - to make sure that the qu- request that they have that they make explicitly get addressed somehow so I don't know if anyone has ideas or - you could even write down ""oh it's about three twenty five and"" -"	no
28402	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
28403	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well what I was just suggesting is - is we have these - this cross pad	no
28404	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah, and use that. Not a bad idea.	no
28405	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	just for this purpose and just use that and if we sink it in -	no
28406	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	That would be great.	no
28407	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	That be great.	no
28408	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	The other thing is eh I don't know if you know this or if it's a question for the mail to Dan but	no
28409	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	is this thing of two eight channel boards a maximum for this setup	no
28410	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I don't know.	no
28411	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	or could we go to a third board?	no
28412	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I don't know.	no
28413	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I'll send mail to Dan and ask. I - I think	no
28414	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	that it's the maximum we can do without a lot of effort because it's one board with two	no
28415	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Oh it is one board.	no
28416	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	digital channels.	no
28417	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	E- eight each. So it - it takes two fibers in to the one board.	no
28418	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	And so w- I think if we wanna do that - more than that	no
28419	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	we'd have to have two boards, and then you have the synchronization issue.	no
28420	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	But that's a question because that would - if it was possible	no
28421	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	cuz it is i- you know already we have a - a - a group of people in this room that cannot all be miked	no
28422	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Right.	no
28423	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	and it's not just cuz we haven't been to the store, right it's -	no
28424	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	What is the limit on each of those f- fiber channels, is it the	no
28425	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Eight.	no
28426	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	It just - it's eight channels come in, does it have do with the sampling rate?	no
28427	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	It's eight.	no
28428	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I have no idea.	no
28429	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	But each - each fiber channel has eight - eight	no
28430	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	channels	no
28431	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	and	no
28432	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	there are two ch- two fibers that go in to the card.	no
28433	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	It might be a hard limitation, I mean one thing is it - the whole thing as I said is - is all structured in terms of forty-eight kilohertz sampling so that pushes	no
28434	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So	no
28435	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	requirements up a bit but	no
28436	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
28437	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I was just wondering if - if that could change.	no
28438	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I mean then we'd also have to get another A_D_D and another mixer and all that sort of stuff.	no
28439	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	If we could drop that.	no
28440	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
28441	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So I - I'll send a mail to Dan and ask him.	no
28442	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
28443	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K on the uh are we done with that?	yes
28444	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
28445	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K on the uh are we done with that?	no
28446	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So the oth- topic is uh getting more mikes and different mikes, so I got a quote um	no
28447	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	We can fit - we have room for one more wireless	no
28448	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	and the wireless, this unit here is three fifty - three hundred fifty dollars, it - I didn't realize but we also have to get a tuner - the receiver - the other end, that's uh four thirty	no
28449	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	um	no
28450	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Wow.	no
28451	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	For - for each? I mean the tuner is four thirty for each.	no
28452	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	and then also	no
28453	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yep.	no
28454	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Wow.	no
28455	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	And we just need one more so - so	no
28456	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah at least w- we got the good ones.	no
28457	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
28458	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So that's you know something like seven hundred eighty bucks for one more of these.	no
28459	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
28460	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K.	no
28461	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Um and then also um	no
28462	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	It turns out that the connector that this thing uses is proprietary of Sony	no
28463	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Oh.	no
28464	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	believe it or not and Sony only sells this headset.	no
28465	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Mmm.	no
28466	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So if we wanna use a different set - headset the solution that the guy suggested and they - apparently lots of people have done	no
28467	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	is Sony will sell you the jack	no
28468	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	with just wires coming out the end	no
28469	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	and then you can buy a headset that has pigtail and solder it yourself.	no
28470	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	And that's the other solution and so the jacks are forty bucks apiece	no
28471	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	and the - he recommended um	no
28472	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	a crown C_M three eleven A_E	no
28473	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	headset for two hundred bucks apiece.	no
28474	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	There isn't this some sort of thing that plugs in, you actually have to go and do the soldering yourself?	no
28475	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Becau- the reason is	no
28476	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	the only - only thing you can get that will plug into this is this mike	no
28477	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	No I understand.	no
28478	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	or just the	no
28479	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	The reason I ask is these sort of handmade	no
28480	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	connector.	no
28481	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	uh wiring jobs fall apart in use	no
28482	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	so the other thing is to see if we can uh get them	no
28483	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	to do a custom job and put it together for this.	no
28484	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Oh I'm sure they would, they would just charge us, so.	no
28485	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well, and they'd probably want quantity too, they'd	no
28486	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well	no
28487	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	no they'll just charge us more, so it's - this	no
28488	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Mmm.	no
28489	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So - so my question is should we go ahead and get na- nine identical head-mounted crown mikes?	no
28490	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Not before having one come here and have some people try it out.	no
28491	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K.	no
28492	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Because there's no point in doing that if it's not gonna be any better.	no
28493	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So why don't we get one of these with the crown with a different headset?	no
28494	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
28495	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	And - and see if that works.	no
28496	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	And see if it's preferable and if it is then we'll get more.	no
28497	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Comfort.	no
28498	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
28499	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
28500	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Cuz I mean I think the microphones are O_K it's just the - the	no
28501	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Right, it's just they're not comfortable to wear.	no
28502	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Right.	no
28503	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Could make our own handbands and	no
28504	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Um, and he said they don't have any of these in stock but they have them in L_A and so it will take about a week to get here.	no
28505	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah well it's -	no
28506	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Um so O_K to just go order?	no
28507	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	We're in this for the long term, yeah. Just order it.	no
28508	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K and who is the contact if I wanna do an invoice cuz I think that's how we did it before.	no
28509	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	It's a lot of money for a handband.	no
28510	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
28511	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Uh we'll do this off-line, yeah.	no
28512	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	It's a long time to get from L_A.	no
28513	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K.	no
28514	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	And then nine channels is the maximum we can do, so.	no
28515	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Uh y- right cuz - so one is for the daisy chain so that's fifteen instead of sixteen and there's six on the table so that's nine.	no
28516	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Without getting more stuff.	no
28517	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Right.	no
28518	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Can I ask a really dumb question?	no
28519	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
28520	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Probably.	no
28521	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Is -  is there any way we can have you know like a - a wireless microphone that you pass around to the people who	no
28522	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	you know the extra people for the times they wanna talk	no
28523	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	that -	no
28524	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I mean -	no
28525	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	That's a good idea.	no
28526	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	That's not a dumb question, it's a good idea, yeah.	no
28527	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well I mean -	no
28528	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Like uh	no
28529	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I'm just not sure how we would handle that in the	no
28530	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	That's like the Conch.  See, look.	no
28531	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	like you know Jerry Springer thing, you know r-	no
28532	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well but -	no
28533	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Like at conferences	no
28534	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	well but there might be a way to say that there are gonna be these different people	no
28535	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	so nail the chairs down.	no
28536	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	um	no
28537	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	and I don't know identifying somehow? You know I was just thinking of Jerry Springer.	no
28538	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.   @@	no
28539	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah, somehow. It's not a bad idea.	no
28540	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	No that -	no
28541	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	no - no that's a very - if we can't get another board and even if we can I have a feeling they'll be some work.	no
28542	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I mean for the few times that you might wanna have that.	no
28543	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	The Springer mike.	no
28544	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Let's figure that we have eight which are set up and then there's a ninth which is passed around to -	no
28545	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	A hand-held, yeah.	no
28546	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	that's a good idea	no
28547	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Infinite expansion.	no
28548	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Right.	no
28549	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Kind of rules out overlap but -  but uh	no
28550	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well or also for you know if people are not	no
28551	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
28552	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well we could just hand around the lapel.	no
28553	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Uh no - no that's -	no
28554	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Rather than get a - do you want a handset?	no
28555	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	No not the lapel.	no
28556	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	No.	no
28557	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well I mean is the - is the hand-held really any better?	no
28558	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Liz hates the lapel.	no
28559	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yes.	no
28560	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K.	no
28561	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I don't know but I d- I know the lapel is really suboptimal.	no
28562	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	No it -	no
28563	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Is awful?	no
28564	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	no it depends on the hand-held but hand - many hand-helds are built wi- with sort of uh anti-shock sort of things so that it - it is less	no
28565	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	uh susceptible to hand noises.	no
28566	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Mm-hmm.	no
28567	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	If you hold the lapel mike i- you just get all k- sorts of junk.	no
28568	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Right.	no
28569	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I mean the ones they really pass around must be sort of O_K.	no
28570	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K.	no
28571	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	so	no
28572	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So I wonder if they have one that will hook up.	no
28573	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
28574	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	They have -	no
28575	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	What?	no
28576	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I wonder if they have one that will hook up to this or whether again we'll have to wire it ourselves.	no
28577	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well, you wouldn't want it to hook there you'd just want it to hook into the receiver in the other room, right?	no
28578	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	No that's uh - you need a transmitter.	no
28579	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	What?	no
28580	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Is th- isn't that built into the mike?	no
28581	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Oh I see. Get a - get a different radio, yeah.	no
28582	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah just these ones that they	no
28583	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
28584	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	pass around with no you know wireless	no
28585	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	But you need a ra- but it has to correspond to the receiver.	no
28586	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Have a little antenna coming out the bottom.	no
28587	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	It's gonna be much easier to get one of these and just plug in a mike, isn't it?	no
28588	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	But then the mike has to h-	no
28589	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Do you have to hand it around and if you have two pieces of	no
28590	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
28591	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	No no -	no
28592	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Right.	no
28593	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	@@	no
28594	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	so right, so this is a good point, so yeah you have these - these mikes with a little antenna on the end right?	no
28595	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K. And do you think you would be able to use the same receiver?	no
28596	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I don't know. You'll have to check with them, yeah.	no
28597	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K I'll - I'll ask. Yeah.	no
28598	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	It's just a frequency.	no
28599	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	But that's - that's a great idea and then just sort of have that as the - and then you can have groups of twenty people or whatever and - and uh	no
28600	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah because there's only I mean as Andreas pointed out actually I think in the large - the larger the group the less	no
28601	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Pretty soon.	no
28602	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	interaction - the less people are talking	no
28603	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Mmm, yeah.	no
28604	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	um over each other - it just - there might be a lot of people that speak once or twice and	no
28605	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Right.	no
28606	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Um	no
28607	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Off you go, yeah.	no
28608	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Gotta go.	no
28609	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K so I guess people who have to leave can leave and do we have anything else to discuss or should we just do digits?	no
28610	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I - I thought of some extra - a couple of extra things I'd like to mention.	yes
28611	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K so I guess people who have to leave can leave and do we have anything else to discuss or should we just do digits?	no
28612	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I - I thought of some extra - a couple of extra things I'd like to mention.	no
28613	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K.	no
28614	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	One of them is to give you a status in terms of the transcriptions so far.	no
28615	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So um as of last night	no
28616	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	uh	no
28617	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	um I'd assigned twelve hours and they'd finished nine and my goal was to have eleven done by the end of the month, I think that by tomorrow we'll have ten.	no
28618	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So they're still working.	no
28619	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Uh it's great - I j- and this - I got this email from Jane at like two in the morning or something so it's really great	no
28620	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Pretty close, that's good.	no
28621	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yep, that's good.	no
28622	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Wow.	no
28623	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	It's working out, thanks.	no
28624	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	It's really great.	no
28625	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Thanks.	no
28626	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	And then um	no
28627	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	also an idea for another meeting, which would be to have the transcribers talk about the data  It's sort of a - a little bit - a little bit	no
28628	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	That's a great idea.	no
28629	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yep, that'd be very interesting. I'd love to hear what they have to say.	no
28630	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Super idea.	no
28631	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
28632	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	That's a great idea cuz I'd like to g- have it recorded so that we can remember all the little things, that's a great idea.	no
28633	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
28634	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So if we got them to talk about this meeting, it would be a meta - meta meeting.	no
28635	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
28636	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah, exa-  exactly I guess - nested several layers, but	no
28637	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Now you have eight transcribers and there's ten of us so how do we do this, is the only thing.	no
28638	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Or just have them talk amongst themselves.	no
28639	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Have them have their own meeting.	no
28640	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well that's what I'm thinking, yeah.	no
28641	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	And have	no
28642	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Have them talk about the data	no
28643	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Oh.	no
28644	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	that would be great.	no
28645	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	and they - and they've made observations to me like they say	no
28646	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	uh you know this meeting that we think has so much overlap, in fact it does	no
28647	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	but there are other groups of similar size that have very little, you know it's part of it's - it's the norm of the group and all that and they have various observations that would be fun, I think.	no
28648	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	That's a great idea.	no
28649	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
28650	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah, I'd like to hear what they s- say.	no
28651	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Be great.	no
28652	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K.	no
28653	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So maybe we could - they could have a meeting	no
28654	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	more or less without us that - to do this and we should record it	no
28655	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	and then maybe one or two of them could come to one of these meetings and - and could you know could tell us about it.	no
28656	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
28657	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Give us a status.	no
28658	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
28659	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Oh good. O_K.	no
28660	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
28661	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	It's - they will get to transcribe their own meeting but they also get paid for having a break and I think that's a good idea, get them involved.	no
28662	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	What - what	no
28663	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	That would be weird.	no
28664	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	yeah that's right.	no
28665	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah exactly, yeah.	no
28666	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
28667	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Great.	no
28668	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Um that's a great idea. I'm really sorry I have to g-	no
28669	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Great.	no
28670	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Super.	no
28671	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	no I have to go as well.	no
28672	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K.	no
28673	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	And then I wanted to also um say something about the Fiscus uh uh John - John Fiscus visit tomorrow.	yes
28674	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K.	no
28675	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	And then I wanted to also um say something about the Fiscus uh uh John - John Fiscus visit tomorrow.	no
28676	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	And	no
28677	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Which is to say that w- it'll be from nine to one	no
28678	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	that I'm going to	no
28679	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	uh uh offer the organization - allow him to uh adjust it if he wishes but	no
28680	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	to be basically in three parts, the acoustic part coming first which would be	no
28681	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	basically the room engineering aspects um other things	no
28682	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	and he'll be also presenting what NIST is doing and -	no
28683	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	and	no
28684	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	uh then	no
28685	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	uh number two would be sort of a	no
28686	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	the - the transcription process so this would be a focus on like presegmentation and the modifications to the - the multitrans interface which allows more refined encoding of the beginnings and ends of the overlapping segments	no
28687	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	which uh Dave Gelbart's been doing and then um	no
28688	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	uh and of course the presegmentation Thilo's been doing	no
28689	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	and then um the third part would - and again he has some stuff that's i- relevant with respect to NIST and then the third one would be focus on transcription standards so	no
28690	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	at NIST he's interested in this establishment of a global encoding standard I guess I would say and I want it, you know k- yeah	no
28691	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	see what they're doing and also present	no
28692	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	what - what	no
28693	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	we've chosen as ours and - and discuss that kind of thing.	no
28694	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	And so but he's only here  until	no
28695	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	until   one and actually we're thinking of noon being uh lunch time so basically hoping that we can get as much of this done as possible before noon.	no
28696	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	S-	no
28697	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K.	no
28698	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	And everybody who wants to attend is welcome.	no
28699	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So yeah.	no
28700	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Oh, where you're gonna meet?	no
28701	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Here mostly but I've also reserved the BARCO room	no
28702	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	um eh to figure out how that works in terms of like maybe having a live demonstration.	no
28703	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K but the nine o'cl- nine o'clock will be i- be in here. Yeah, O_K.	no
28704	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah. Mm-hmm.	no
28705	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I assume we're not gonna try to record it?	no
28706	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Oh I think that would be hard, yeah.	no
28707	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah, I think just adds -	no
28708	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Alright.	no
28709	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
28710	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Um good.	no
28711	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Thank you though, uh-huh.	no
28712	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So maybe do digits and	yes
28713	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Thank you though, uh-huh.	no
28714	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So maybe do digits and	no
28715	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
28716	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Unless there's anything else?	no
28717	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	recess?	no
28718	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
28719	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Do digital  ones ?	no
28720	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Uh O_K.	no
28721	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
28722	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Uh should y- we make him wear Andreas' mike or would that just be too confusing?	no
28723	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
28724	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	No I don't think it's confusing. Well, it doesn't confuse me.	no
28725	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	When we do this in the key - in the key - in the key it has to indicate that channel change, right?	no
28726	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Does it mess up the forms?	no
28727	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Uh yeah I just don't know how we would do that, so.	no
28728	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Well i- have a time mark.	no
28729	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I mean other than free - free form.	no
28730	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	The on switch is here on the -	no
28731	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Yeah.	no
28732	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	on the top there.	no
28733	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	O_K.	no
28734	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	And just clip it to your collar.	no
28735	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	That's fine.	no

28739	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Currently I'm taking uh	no
28740	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	my first graduate level courses in D_S_P	no
28741	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	and um when I come back to Norway	no
28742	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I'm gonna continue with the - more of a research project work -	no
28743	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	kind of work.	no
28744	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So this semester I'm starting up with a - with a small project	no
28745	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	through uh Dave Gelbart which I'm taking a course with	no
28746	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I got in touch with him and he told me about this project.	no
28747	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So with the help of uh Dan Ellis	no
28748	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I'm gonna do	no
28749	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	small project associated to this.	no
28750	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	What I'm gonna try to do is uh use - use ech- echo cancellation	no
28751	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	to uh	no
28752	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	to handle the periods where you have overlapping talk.	no
28753	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	To try to do something about that.	no
28754	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So currently I'm um	no
28755	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	I'm just reading up on echo cancellation,	no
28756	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	s- looking into the theory behind that	no
28757	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	and then uh	no
28758	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	hopefully I get some results.	no
28759	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So it - it's a - it's a project goes over the course of one semester.	no
28760	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Great.	no
28761	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	So I'm just here today to introduce myself.	no
28762	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Tell about I'll be - I'll be working on this.	no
28763	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	And are you staying at Berkeley or is - are you just here a semester?	no
28764	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	This is my second semester and last.	no
28765	transcript	transcript_Bmr012	Ah second and last, O_K.	no

28940	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Alright.	no
28941	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Alright, and no crash.	no
28942	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Hmm.	no
28943	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I  pre-crashed  it.	no
28944	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
28945	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Pre-crashed!	no
28946	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	It never crashes on me.	no
28947	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I  think  it's actually - it depends on if the  temp  files are there or not,	no
28948	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	What is - what is that?	no
28949	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	that - at least that's my current working hypothesis,	no
28950	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Ah.	no
28951	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	that I think what happens is it tries to  clear  the temp files and if they're  too   big,  it  crashes.	no
28952	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Ah.	no
28953	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	When the power went out the other day and I restarted it, it crashed the first time.	no
28954	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh,  that's  right.	no
28955	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	After the power out-	no
28956	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So then there would be no temp files.	no
28957	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
28958	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	O_K.  Hmm.	no
28959	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Uh, no, it doesn't - it doesn't clear those necessarily, so.	no
28960	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh  wait  - It - it doesn't clear  them,   O_K.	no
28961	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Hmm, no connection.	no
28962	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	It's - i- they're  called  temp files, but they're not actually in the temp directory they're in the  scratch,  so.	no
28963	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	They're not backed up, but they're not	no
28964	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	erased  either on power failure.	no
28965	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But that's usually the meeting that  I  recorded, and it neve- it doesn't  crash  on me.	no
28966	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh well.	no
28967	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well this wasn't - Actually, this wasn't a- before  your  meeting, this was, um, Tuesday afternoon when, um,	no
28968	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh -	no
28969	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	uh, Robert just wanted to do a little recording, and the power had gone out earlier in the day.	no
28970	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh, right. O_K.	no
28971	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Huh, O_K.	no
28972	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I don't know when would be a good excuse for it, but I just can't wait to be giving a talk t- and - and - and use the example from last week with everybody t- doing the digits at once.	no
28973	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
28974	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	That  was  fun.	no
28975	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I'd love to play somebody that.	no
28976	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	That  was  fun.	no
28977	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	It was quick.	no
28978	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	It  was.  It was really efficient.	no
28979	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Talk about a good  noise  shield. You know?	no
28980	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	You wanted to pe- keep people from listening in, you could like have that playing outside the room. Nobody could listen in.	no
28981	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
28982	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well, I had this idea we could make our whole  meeting  faster that way.	no
28983	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
28984	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Everybody give the reports about what they were doing at exactly the same time, yeah.	no
28985	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	And we'll just all leave, and -	no
28986	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	And then we'll - we'll go back later and review the individual channels, right? If you wanna know what -	no
28987	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yep, and then everyone can listen to it  later.	no
28988	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yes.  Absolutely.	no
28989	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Actually isn't that what we have been doing?	no
28990	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
28991	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	It's what it  sounds  like.	no
28992	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Practically, huh. With all the overlaps.	no
28993	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
28994	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	What are we doing?	no
28995	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I -	no
28996	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Since I've been gone all week, I didn't send out a reminder for an  agenda,  so.	yes
28997	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I -	no
28998	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Since I've been gone all week, I didn't send out a reminder for an  agenda,  so.	no
28999	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, and I'm just -	no
29000	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Do we have anything to talk about or should we just read digits and go?	no
29001	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I  wouldn't mind hearing how the conference was.	no
29002	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	What conference?	no
29003	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Uh,	no
29004	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah,  really.	no
29005	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I had one question about - Aren't the U_W folks coming this weekend?	yes
29006	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I had one question about - Aren't the U_W folks coming this weekend?	no
29007	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	It's all a blur.	no
29008	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yep.	no
29009	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	No. The  next,  right?	no
29010	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Next  weekend, week from -	no
29011	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Next  weekend?	no
29012	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	That is  right.  The next weekend.	no
29013	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Sorry, not - not - not the days coming up, but -	no
29014	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	It's like the -	no
29015	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	A week from Saturday.	no
29016	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah,  within  ten days. So, are we - do we have like an agenda or anything that we should be -	no
29017	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	That's  when they're  coming.   That's   correct.	no
29018	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	No, but that would be a good idea.	no
29019	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	O_K.	no
29020	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Why don't we w-	no
29021	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So - so the deal is that I can,	no
29022	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	um,	no
29023	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	uh, I can be available after,	no
29024	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	uh, like	no
29025	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	ten thirty or something. I don't know how s- how early you wanted to -	no
29026	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	They're not even gonna be here until eleven or so.	no
29027	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh, O_K.	no
29028	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	That's good.	no
29029	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So -	no
29030	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Wait, this is on - on Sunday? Or Saturday?	no
29031	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Cuz they're flying up that day.	no
29032	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Saturday.	no
29033	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Saturday.	no
29034	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Saturday.	no
29035	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	O_K.	no
29036	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well, y-	no
29037	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	S- Saturday.	no
29038	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Mm-hmm.	no
29039	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
29040	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Eurospeech  is due on Friday and then I'm going down to San -	no
29041	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	uh, San  Jose  Friday  night,  so, if - you know, if we start nice and late Saturday that's a good thing.	no
29042	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	No, I mean, they're flying up from - from -	no
29043	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Seattle.	no
29044	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	down from	no
29045	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Seattle.	no
29046	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	They're flying  from  somewhere  to  somewhere,	no
29047	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah,	no
29048	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	yeah.	no
29049	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	and they'll end up here. So b- and also Brian  Kingsbury  is actually flying	no
29050	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	from, uh, the east  coast	no
29051	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	on that - that morning.	no
29052	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Excellent.	no
29053	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh.	no
29054	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So, i- I - I will be - I mean, he's taking a very early flight and we do have the time work difference running the right way,	no
29055	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	but I  still  think that there's no way we could start before eleven. It might end up really being twelve.	no
29056	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So when we get closer we'll find people's plane schedules, and let everybody know.	no
29057	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Uh,	no
29058	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So. That's  good.	no
29059	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But, uh, yeah maybe an agenda, or at least some things to talk about would be a good idea.	no
29060	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well we can start gathering those - those ideas, but then we - we should firm it up by next - next Thursday's meeting.	no
29061	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Will we have time to, um,	yes
29062	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Will we have time to, um,	no
29063	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	to prepare something that we - in the format we were planning for the I_B_M transcribers by then, or - ?	no
29064	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh yeah.	no
29065	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Absolutely.	no
29066	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	O_K.	no
29067	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So have you heard back from Brian about that,	no
29068	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Chuck?	no
29069	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yes, um, he's - I - I'm sorry, I should have forwarded that along.	no
29070	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Uh,  oh I - I think I mentioned at the last meeting, he said that, um,	no
29071	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	he talked to them and it was fine - with the beeps they would be - That's easy for them to do.	no
29072	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Great.	no
29073	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	O_K.	no
29074	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So, uh, oh, though Thi- Thilo isn't here, um, but, uh,	no
29075	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I - I  have  the program to insert the beeps. What I don't have is something to  parse  the  output	no
29076	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	of	no
29077	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	the channelized	no
29078	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	transcripts  to find out where to put the beeps, but that should be really easy to do.	no
29079	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So do we have a meeting that that's been  done  with,	no
29080	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	He's - he's -	no
29081	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	that we've tightened it up to the point where we can actually	no
29082	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	give it to I_B_M and have them try it out?	no
29083	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	He generated, um, a channel-wise  presegmented   version of a meeting, but it was Robustness rather than E_D_U so I guess	no
29084	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	depends on whether we're willing to use Robustness?	no
29085	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Mm-hmm.	no
29086	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well for this experiment I think we can use pre- pretty much anything. This experiment of just -	no
29087	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	O_K.	no
29088	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well we had -	no
29089	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	we had  talked  about doing maybe E_D_U as a good	no
29090	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	choice, though. Well,	no
29091	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	whatever  we have.	no
29092	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well we've talked about that as being the next ones we wanted to transcribe.	no
29093	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
29094	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But for the purpose of sending him a sample one to - f- I - I don't think it matte-	no
29095	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	O_K.	no
29096	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, maybe it doesn't matter.	no
29097	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Great. I'll - I'll - I'll, um, get - make that available.	no
29098	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	O_K, and has it	no
29099	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	been corrected?	no
29100	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh, well,  wait.  Um -	no
29101	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Hand-checked? Cuz that was one of the	no
29102	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	processes we were talking about as well.	no
29103	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right, so we need to run	no
29104	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	That's  right.	no
29105	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Thilo's thing on it, and then we go in and adjust the boundaries.	no
29106	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah that's right. Yeah, we haven't  done  that. I - I could set someone on that tomorrow.	no
29107	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	And time how long it takes.	no
29108	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
29109	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	O_K. And we probably don't have to do necessarily a whole meeting for that if we just wanna send them a sample to try.	no
29110	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I think they're coming -	no
29111	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	O_K.	no
29112	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	What would be a good number of minutes?	no
29113	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I don't know, maybe we can figure out how long it'll take  @@  to - to do.	no
29114	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Um,	no
29115	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I don't know, it seems to me w-	no
29116	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	we	no
29117	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	probably  should go ahead and do a whole  meeting  because we'll have to transcribe the whole meeting anyway  sometime.	no
29118	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yes except that if they had - if there was a choice between	no
29119	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	having fifteen minutes that was fully the way you wanted it, and having a whole meeting that didn't get at what you wanted for them -	no
29120	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	It's just dependent of how much -	no
29121	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Like  I -	no
29122	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I mean I guess if we have to do it again  anyway,	no
29123	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	but, uh	no
29124	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
29125	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I guess, the only thing I'm not sure about is, um,	no
29126	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	how quickly can the transcribers scan over and fix the boundaries, and -	no
29127	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Mm-hmm.	no
29128	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I mean, is it pretty easy?	no
29129	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I  think  it's gonna be one or two times  real  time at -	no
29130	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Wow,	no
29131	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	excuse  me,  two  or  more  times  real  time, right?	no
29132	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Cuz they have to at  least   listen  to it.	no
29133	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Can we pipeline it so that say there's, uh, the transcriber gets done with a quarter of the meeting and then we - you run it through this other -	no
29134	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	other stuff?	no
29135	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well the  other  stuff is I_B_ M.	no
29136	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Uh,	no
29137	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I'm just thinking that	no
29138	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	from a data -	no
29139	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	O_K, so.	no
29140	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	keeping-track-of-the- data  point of view, it may be best	no
29141	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	to send them  whole  meetings at a  time  and not try to send them  bits  and pieces.	no
29142	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh, that's right. So the first thing is the automatic thing,	no
29143	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
29144	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	and then it's - then it's - then it's the transcribers tightening stuff up, and then it's I_B_M.	no
29145	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Mm-hmm.	no
29146	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.	no
29147	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
29148	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	O_K, so you might as well ha- run the automatic thing over the entire meeting,	no
29149	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	and then -	no
29150	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	and then, uh,	no
29151	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	you would give I_B_M whatever was	no
29152	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	fixed.	no
29153	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	And have them fix it over the entire meeting  too?	no
29154	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
29155	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well, yeah, but start from the beginning and go to the end, right? So if they were only half way through then that's what you'd give I_B_M.	no
29156	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	O_K.	no
29157	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right?	no
29158	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	As of what point?	no
29159	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I mean.	no
29160	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	The - I guess the question on my mind is do we wait for the transcribers to adjust the marks for the whole meeting before we give  anything  to I_B_M, or do we go ahead and send them a sample?	no
29161	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Why wouldn't we s-  @@  w- i- if they were going sequentially through it, why wouldn't	no
29162	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Let their -	no
29163	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	we give them -	no
29164	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I mean i- are we trying to get something done by the time Brian comes?	no
29165	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well I - I - I mean, I don't know.	no
29166	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	That was the question.	no
29167	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Though.	no
29168	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So if we - if we  were,	no
29169	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
29170	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	then it seems like giving them  something,  whatever they had gotten  up  to, would be better than nothing.	no
29171	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Uh. That - I agree. I agree.	no
29172	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well, I don't think -	no
29173	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I mean, h-	no
29174	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	they - they typically work for what, four hours, something like that?	no
29175	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Hmm, I gue- hmm.	no
29176	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I think the- they  should  be able to get through a whole meeting in one sitting.	no
29177	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I would  think,  unless it's a lot harder than we think it  is,  which it  could   be,	no
29178	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	certainly.	no
29179	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	If  it's got like for speakers then	no
29180	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I guess - I mean if - hhh	no
29181	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Or seven or eight.	no
29182	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	We're just doing the individual channels, right?	no
29183	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Individual channels. Yeah.	no
29184	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So it's gonna be, depending on the number of people in the meeting,	no
29185	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I guess there is this issue of, you know, if - if the segmenter thought there was no speech on - on a particular stretch, on a particular channel, and there really  was,	no
29186	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	um,	no
29187	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well -	no
29188	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	then, if it didn't show up in a mixed signal to verify, then it might be overlooked,	no
29189	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	"so, I mean, the question is ""should - should a transcriber listen to the entire thing or can it"	no
29190	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	"g- can it be based on the mixed signal?"" And I th- eh so far as I'm concerned it's fine to base it on the mixed signal at this point, and -"	no
29191	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	That's what it seems to me  too,  in that	no
29192	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	if they  need  to, just like in the  other  cases, they can listen to the individual,	no
29193	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	And that cuts down the time.	no
29194	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	if they  need  to.	no
29195	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
29196	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But they don't  have  to for most of it.	no
29197	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, that's good. So. Yeah. Good, good, good.	no
29198	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I don't see how that will  work,  though.	no
29199	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	What - what aspect?	no
29200	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So you're talking about tightening up time boundaries? So how do you -	no
29201	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
29202	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So, they  have  the normal channeltrans	no
29203	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	interface where they have each individual speaker has their own line,	no
29204	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
29205	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	but you're  listening  to the mixed signal and you're  tightening  the boundaries,	no
29206	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	correcting  the boundaries. You  shouldn't  have to tighten them too  much  because Thilo's program  does  that.	no
29207	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Should be pretty good, yeah.	no
29208	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Except for  it doesn't do well on  short  things, remember. It will  miss  them. It will miss most of the really short things.	no
29209	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right, so - so you'll have to I -	no
29210	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Uh-huh.	no
29211	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Like that.	no
29212	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But those would be - those would be -	no
29213	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Uh-huh.	no
29214	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Uh-huh!	no
29215	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	"It will - it will miss - Yeah, you have to say ""uh-huh"" more slowly to -"	no
29216	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Sorry.	no
29217	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	to get c- No, I'm s- I'm actually serious. So it  will  miss stuff like that which -	no
29218	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I'll work on that.	no
29219	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well,  so - so that's something that the transcribers will have to - have to  do.	no
29220	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I -	no
29221	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, but presumably, most of those they	no
29222	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	should be able to hear from the mixed signal unless they're embedded in the heavil- heavy overlap section when - in which case they'd be listening to the channels anyway.	no
29223	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right, and that's what I'm not sure about.	no
29224	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	That's - that's what I'm - I'm concerned about the part.	no
29225	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, I am too. And I think it's an empirical question.	no
29226	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Can't we - uh couldn't we just have, um,	no
29227	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I don't know, maybe this just doesn't fit with the software, but I guess	no
29228	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	if I didn't know anything about Transcriber and I was gonna  make  something to let them adjust boundaries, I would just show them	no
29229	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	one channel at a time, with the marks, and let them adju-	no
29230	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh they can -	no
29231	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well, but then they have to do -	no
29232	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	but then they - for this meeting they would have to do seven times real time,	no
29233	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, that's it.	no
29234	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	and it would probably be  more  than that.	no
29235	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
29236	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right? Because they'd have to at least listen to each  channel	no
29237	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	all  the way  through.	no
29238	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But i- but it's very  quick,  right? I mean, you scan - I mean, if you  have  a display of the  waveform.	no
29239	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	And if - Uh-huh.	no
29240	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh, you're talking about visually. I just don't think -	no
29241	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah. w- Well,	no
29242	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	the other problem is the breaths cuz you also see the breaths on the waveform. I've - I've looked at the int- uh, s- I've tried to do that with a single channel,	no
29243	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	and - and you do see all sorts of other stuff besides just the voice.	no
29244	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Uh-huh.	no
29245	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, and I - I think that	no
29246	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	they're going much more on acoustics than they are on visuals.	no
29247	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well  that  -  that  I'm not  sure.  What you - the digital - what the digital task that you had your interface?	no
29248	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So.	no
29249	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Um, I know for a fact that one of those - sh- she could really well - she could judge what th- what the number was based on the - on the waveform.	no
29250	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, that's actually true. Yeah, you're  right.	no
29251	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	You're absolutely right.	no
29252	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, I found the same thing that when I was scanning through the wave form	no
29253	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I could  see  when someone started to read digits just by the shapes.	no
29254	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, she could tell which one was  seven.	no
29255	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Um, maybe.	no
29256	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
29257	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So I don't - I'm - I'm now entirely confused about what they do. So, they're - they're looking at	no
29258	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But -	no
29259	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	a mixed signal, or they're looking - what - what are they looking at visually?	no
29260	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well, they have a choice. They could choose  any  signal to look at.	no
29261	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I've tried lookin- but usually they look at the mixed.	no
29262	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But I've - I've  tried  looking at the single signal and - and	no
29263	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	in order to judge when it - when it was speech and when it wasn't, but the problem is then you have breaths which - which show up on the signal.	no
29264	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh.	no
29265	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But the procedure that you're imagining, I mean, people vary from this, is that they have the mixed signal wave form in front of them,	no
29266	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yes.	no
29267	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	@@	no
29268	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yes.	no
29269	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	and they have multiple, uh, well, let's see, there isn't -	no
29270	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	we don't have transcription yet.	no
29271	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So - but there's  markers  of some sort that have been happening automatically, and those show up on the mixed signal? There's a  @@  clicks?	no
29272	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
29273	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yes.	no
29274	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh, they show up on the separate ribbons. So you have a separate ribbon for each channel,	no
29275	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	N-	no
29276	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	the t-	no
29277	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
29278	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	There're separate ribbons.	no
29279	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	and - and i- i- it'll be - because it's being segmented as channel at a time with his - with Thilo's new procedure, then	no
29280	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	you don't have the correspondence of the times across the bins - uh across the ribbons uh you could have -	no
29281	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	And is there a line moving across the waveform as it goes? O_K, so	no
29282	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yes.	no
29283	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yes.	no
29284	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	The way you're imaging is they kind of play it, and they see oh this happened, then this happened, then - and if it's about right, they just sort of let it slide,	no
29285	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
29286	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
29287	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
29288	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	and if it - if it - there's a question on something, they stop and maybe look at the individual wave form.	no
29289	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
29290	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	"Oh, well not - not ""look""."	no
29291	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well, they  wouldn't   look  at it	no
29292	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	at this point.	no
29293	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	They would just listen.	no
29294	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	They - they might look at it, right?	no
29295	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well, the  problem  is that the -	no
29296	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	the  interface	no
29297	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	doesn't really allow you to switch visuals.	no
29298	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Not very quickly. You  can  but it takes time.	no
29299	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	The  problem  is that - that -	no
29300	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	the Tcl-T_K interface with	no
29301	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	the  visuals,  it's very slow to load waveforms.	no
29302	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	That's it.	no
29303	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Uh-huh.	no
29304	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	And so when I tried - that -	no
29305	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	that was the first thing I tried when I first started it,	no
29306	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh, oh.  Visually.	no
29307	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	right?	no
29308	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	You can - you can switch  quickly  between the  audio,  but you just can't get the visual display to show quickly.	no
29309	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So you have to - It takes, I don't know, three, four minutes to - Well, I mean, it takes - it takes long enough -	no
29310	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, it's very slow	no
29311	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	It takes long enough cuz it has to reload the I - I don't know exactly what it's doing frankly cuz - but it t- it takes long enough that it's just not a practical alternative.	no
29312	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	to do that.	no
29313	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	That w-	no
29314	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well it -	no
29315	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	it	no
29316	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	does some sort of  shape  pre-computation so that it can then scroll it quickly, yeah. But then you can't	no
29317	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But you can  cancel  that.	no
29318	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
29319	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	change the resolution or  scroll  quickly.	no
29320	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh, really?	no
29321	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So.	no
29322	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Huh!	no
29323	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Now you  could  set up multiple windows, each one with a different  signal  showing,	no
29324	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	and then look between the windows. Maybe  that's  the solution.	no
29325	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I mean, we - we could  do  different interfaces, right?	no
29326	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	What if you  preload  them all?	no
29327	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I mean, so - so we could  use  like X_Waves instead of Transcriber,	no
29328	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
29329	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	and it loads faster,	no
29330	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	certainly.	no
29331	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	What if you were to  preload  all the channels or -	no
29332	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	or initially -	no
29333	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	like doesn't -	no
29334	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well that's what I tried originally. So I - I actually before,	no
29335	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	uh,	no
29336	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Dave Gelbart did this, I  did  an interface which showed each waveform and ea-	no
29337	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	a  ribbon  for each waveform,	no
29338	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Mm-hmm.	no
29339	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	but the  problem  with it is even with just  three  waveforms it was just painfully slow to scroll.	no
29340	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh, O_K.	no
29341	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So you just scroll a  screen  and it would, you know go	no
29342	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	"""kur-chunk!"""	no
29343	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Mm-hmm.	no
29344	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	And so it just was not doable with the current interface.	no
29345	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	You know, I  am  thinking if we have a meeting with only four speakers and, you know, you could	no
29346	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	fire up a Transcriber interface for, y- you know, in different windows, multiple ones, one for each channel. And it's sort of a - a hack but I mean it would be one way of  seeing  the visual form.	no
29347	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I think that if we  decide  that	no
29348	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	we need -	no
29349	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	that they need to see the visuals, we need to change the interface so that they can do that.	no
29350	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah. Yeah.	no
29351	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	That's actually what I thought of, loading the chopped  up  waveforms, I mean,	no
29352	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	An-	no
29353	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So -	no
29354	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	you know, that - that would make it faster -	no
29355	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Hmm.	no
29356	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But isn't -	no
29357	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	The chopped up waveforms.  Isn't that -	no
29358	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So.	no
29359	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	The problem is if - if anything's cut off, you can't expand it from the chopped up -	no
29360	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
29361	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right, but if you	no
29362	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	And wouldn't that be the  same   as the mixed signal?	no
29363	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	a- at some point -	no
29364	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	No, I mean the individual channels that were chopped up that - it'd be nice to be able to go back and forth between  those	no
29365	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	short segments. Cuz you don't really nee- like	no
29366	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Mm-hmm.	no
29367	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	nine tenths of the time you're throwing most of them out, but what you need are tho- that particular channel, or that particular location, and,	no
29368	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
29369	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	um,	no
29370	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
29371	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	might be nice, cuz we save those out already,	no
29372	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	um,	no
29373	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	to be able to do that. But it won't work for I_B_M of course, it only works here cuz they're not saving out the individual	no
29374	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	channels.	no
29375	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well, I - I  do  think that this - this will be a doable procedure, and have them starting with mixed and, um,	no
29376	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
29377	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	O_K.	no
29378	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	then when they get into overlaps, just have  them   systematically check  all  the channels to be sure that there isn't something hidden from - from audio view.	no
29379	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
29380	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, hopefully, I mean -	no
29381	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	The  mixed  signal, the overlaps are pretty audible	no
29382	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	because it is volume equalized. So I think they should be able to hear.	no
29383	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	The only problem is - is,	no
29384	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	you know, counting how many and if they're really  correct  or not.	no
29385	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So , I don't know.	no
29386	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I don't know that you can locate them very well from the mixed signal,	no
29387	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right but -	no
29388	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	but once - once you know that they  happen,  you can at least  listen	no
29389	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	but you would know that they were there, and then you would switch. Right. And then you would switch into the other -	no
29390	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	to the close talking, so.	no
29391	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But right now, to do this limitation, the switching is going to be switching of the audio? Is what she's saying.	no
29392	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
29393	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
29394	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So -	no
29395	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right, so - so	no
29396	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	did Dave -	no
29397	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	so they're using their ears to do these markings anyway.	no
29398	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yes. Yes.	no
29399	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Did Dave do that change where you can actually just click rather than having to go up to the menu	no
29400	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
29401	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Click -	no
29402	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	to listen to the individual channels?	no
29403	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Um,	no
29404	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I had suggested it before. I just don't know whether he did it or not.	no
29405	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I'm not sure what - click what - click on the ribbon? Yeah, you can get that - oh, oh, get - you can get the, uh - you can get it to switch audio?	no
29406	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
29407	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
29408	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Uh, not last I tried, but, um, maybe he's changed it again.	no
29409	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	We should get him to do that	no
29410	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	because, uh, I think that would be  much,  much faster than going to the menu.	no
29411	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I disagree.	no
29412	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	There's a reason I disagree, and that is that, uh, you - it's very good to have a dissociation between the visual and the audio. There're times when	no
29413	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I wanna hear the mixed signal, bu- but I want to transcribe on the single channel. So right now -	no
29414	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Then maybe just buttons down at the bottom	no

29432	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Hhh!  I would  like  to try to do something on digits but I just don't know if we have time. I mean, it's due next Friday so we have to do the experiments  and  write the paper.	no
29433	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So, I'm gonna  try,	no
29434	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	but, uh,	no
29435	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	we'll just have to see. So actually I wanna get together with both Andreas and, uh,	no

29439	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
29440	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah there was that - we- that's right, we had that one conversation about, uh,	no
29441	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	what - what - what did it mean for, uh, one of those speakers to be pathological, was it a -	no
29442	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right,	no
29443	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	and I haven't had s- chance to sit down and listen. I was going to do that this afternoon.	no
29444	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh, I haven't - I haven't listened to them  either,	no
29445	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	but there  must  be something wrong, I mean,	no

29447	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well,  Morgan  and I were - were having a debate  about that.	no
29448	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Whereas  I  think it- it's  probably  something pathologic and actually  Stephane's  results,	no
29449	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I  think  confirm that. He s- he did	no
29450	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	the  Aurora  system	no
29451	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	also  got very lousy  average  error, like fifteen or -	no

29453	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	uh, fifteen to twenty percent average?	no
29454	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But then he ran it just on the  lapel,	no
29455	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	and got about five or  six  percent word error?	no
29456	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So that - that means to me that  somewhere  in the  other  recordings there are some pathological cases. But,	no
29457	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	you know, we - th- that  may   not be  true.  It may be just  some  of the segments they're just doing a lousy  job  on.	no
29458	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So I'll -  I'll  listen to it and find out since you'd actually split it up by	no
29459	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
29460	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	segment.  So I can actually  listen  to it.	no
29461	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
29462	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Did you run the - Andreas - the r- S_R_I recognizer on the digits?	no

29466	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh.	no
29467	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Since I considered those preliminary, I didn't.	no

29469	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I- it wasn't -	no
29470	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	It was bimodal.	no
29471	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So if you - Yeah, it's actually, um, it - uh - it was trimodal, actually -	no
29472	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh, was it trimodal, O_K.	no
29473	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah. There's zero, a little bit, and a lot.	no
29474	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	trimodal, so	no
29475	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	there were -	no
29476	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	t-	no
29477	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	there was -	no
29478	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	there was one h- one bump at ze- around zero,	no
29479	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	which were the native speakers,	no
29480	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
29481	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
29482	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	the non-pathological native speakers.	no
29483	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Zero percent error?	no
29484	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Y- yeah.	no
29485	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Then there was another bump at, um,	no
29486	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	oh, like fifteen or something.	no
29487	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh was it fifteen?	no
29488	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	This is error you're talking about? O_K.	no
29489	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	whe-	no
29490	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
29491	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah. Those were the non-natives.	no
29492	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
29493	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	And then there was another distinct bump at,	no
29494	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	like, a hundred,	no
29495	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh, wow!	no
29496	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	which must have been some problem. I can't imagine that -	no
29497	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh, O_K.	no
29498	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	What is patho- what do you mean by pathological? I'm sorry, I don't -	no
29499	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Just - just something  really  wrong with -	no
29500	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	In the recording	no
29501	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh.	no
29502	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	A  bug  is what I mean, so that it's like -	no
29503	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh, O_K. I see.	no
29504	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	And there was this  one  meeting, I forget which one it was, where like,	no
29505	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	uh, six out of the eight channels were  all,	no
29506	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	like - had a hundred percent error.	no
29507	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Which  probably  means like there was a -	no
29508	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	th-	no
29509	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	the recording	no
29510	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
29511	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	interface crashed, or there was a short -	no
29512	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	you know, someone was jiggling with a cord or,	no
29513	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But -	no
29514	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	-	no
29515	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	uh, I extracted it incorrectly, it was labeled - it was transcribed incorrectly, something	no
29516	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But -	no
29517	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Mm-hmm.	no
29518	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	really bad happened, and I just haven't listened to it yet to find out what it was.	no
29519	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	O_K.	no
29520	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So, if I excluded the	no
29521	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	pathological ones,	no
29522	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	What we're calling.	no
29523	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	by definition, those that had like over ninety-five percent	no
29524	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	error rate,	no
29525	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	and the  non-natives,  then the average error rate was like one point four or something,	no
29526	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh. Oh.	no
29527	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Hmm!	no
29528	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	which -	no
29529	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	which seemed reasonable given that,	no
29530	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	you know, the models weren't tuned for -	no
29531	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
29532	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	for it. And the grammar wasn't tuned either. It was just a  @@ .	no
29533	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	And it didn't matter whether it was the lapel or whether it was the -	no
29534	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I haven't split it up that way,	no
29535	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	but it would be -	no
29536	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But there's no overlap during the digit readings, so it shouldn't really matter.	no
29537	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
29538	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
29539	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
29540	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So it should -	no
29541	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	No, but there's a little difference, and we haven't looked at it for digits, right? And so,	no
29542	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	There's a  lot.   Yeah.	no
29543	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, so I was curious about that.	no
29544	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	cuz - because what he was - what I was saying when I looked at those things is it - it - I was almost gonna call it quadrimodal because  - because there was a whole  lot   of cases where it was zero percent.	no
29545	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Mm-hmm.	no
29546	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	They just plain got it all right.	no
29547	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
29548	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	And then there - and then there was another bunch that were couple percent or something.	no
29549	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But if you p- if you actually  histogrammed  it, and - it was a nice -	no
29550	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
29551	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	uh, you know, it - it was -  zero  was the most of them, but then	no
29552	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	A normal.  Yeah.	no
29553	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	there were -	no
29554	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	the others were sort of decaying from there.	no
29555	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, yeah.	no
29556	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	And then there was the bump for the  non-natives  and then the pathological ones, so.	no
29557	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I see. I see.	no
29558	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	@@	no
29559	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	@@	no
29560	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, cuz some of our non-natives are pretty non-native.  So.	no
29561	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
29562	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	You - did you have, uh, something in the report about, uh, - about, uh, for- f- uh, forced alignment? Have you - have you started on that?	yes
29563	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
29564	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	You - did you have, uh, something in the report about, uh, - about, uh, for- f- uh, forced alignment? Have you - have you started on that?	no
29565	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh, well, yeah, so I've been struggling with the forced alignments. Um.	no
29566	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So the scheme that I	no
29567	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	drew on the board last time where we tried to, um	no
29568	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	allow  reject  models for the	no
29569	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	s-	no
29570	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	speech from other	no
29571	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	speakers,	no
29572	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	um,	no
29573	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	most  of the time it doesn't  work  very well.	no
29574	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So,	no
29575	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	um,	no
29576	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Hmm.	no
29577	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	and the -	no
29578	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I haven't done - I mean, the only	no
29579	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	way to  check  this right now was for me to actually	no
29580	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	load these into  X_Waves  and,	no
29581	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	you know, plus the alignments, and s-	no
29582	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	play  them and see where the -	no
29583	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	And it looks - And so I looked at	no
29584	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	all of the	no
29585	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	utterances from  you,  Chuck, in that	no
29586	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	one conversation,	no
29587	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I don't know which -  You  probably know which one I mean, it's	no
29588	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	where  you  were on the  lapel	no
29589	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	and Morgan was sitting next to you and we can hear everything Morgan says.	no
29590	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Hmm.	no
29591	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But -	no
29592	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	and - and some of what you - I mean, you  also	no
29593	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	appear quite a bit in that cross-talk.	no
29594	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So,	no
29595	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I actually	no
29596	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	went through  all  of those, there were I think fifty-five segments,	no
29597	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	um, in - in  X_Waves , and - and	no
29598	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	sort of did a crude check, and	no
29599	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	more often than not, it - it gets it wrong. So there's either the beginning,  mostly  the beginning word,	no
29600	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	where th- you, um,	no
29601	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	you know, Chuck talks somewhere into the segment,	no
29602	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	but	no
29603	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	the first,	no
29604	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	um,  word  of what he  says,  often	no
29605	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	"""I"" but it's very  reduced  ""I,"""	no
29606	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	that's just aligned	no
29607	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	to the beginning of someone else's speech, uh in that segment, which is cross-talk. So,	no
29608	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	um,	no
29609	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I'm still tinkering with it, but	no
29610	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	it might well be that we can't get clean alignments out of this - out of those, uh,	no
29611	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	channels, so.	no
29612	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Unless maybe we do this, uh, um, cancellation business.	no
29613	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right, but that's - I mean, that was our plan, but it's clear from Dan that this is not something you can do in a short amount of time.	no
29614	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, right.	no
29615	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh, the short amount of time thing, right.	no
29616	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So - so  we  - you know, we had spent a lot of time, um, writing up the H_L_T paper and we wanted to use that, uh, kind of analysis, but the H_L_T paper has,	yes
29617	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh, the short amount of time thing, right.	no
29618	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So - so  we  - you know, we had spent a lot of time, um, writing up the H_L_T paper and we wanted to use that, uh, kind of analysis, but the H_L_T paper has,	no
29619	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
29620	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	you know, it's a very crude measure of overlap. It's not really something you could scientifically say is overlap, it's just whether or not the,	no
29621	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	um,	no
29622	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	c- High correlation.	no
29623	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	the segments that were all synchronized, whether there was some overlap somewhere.	no
29624	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	And, you know, that pointed out some differences, so he thought well if we can	no
29625	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	do something quick and dirty because Dan said the cross-cancellation, it's not straight-forward. If it were straight-forward then we would try it, but - so, it's sort of	no
29626	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	good to hear that it was not straight-forward, thinking if we can get decent forced alignments,	no
29627	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	then at least we can do sort of a overall report of	no
29628	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	what happens with actual overlap	no
29629	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	in time, but,	no
29630	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	um -	no
29631	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I didn't think that his message said it wasn't straight- forward.	no
29632	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well if we'd just -	no
29633	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well	no
29634	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Um-hmm.	no
29635	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I thought he's just saying you have to look over a longer  time  window when you do it.	no
29636	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	and the - but there are some issues of this timing, um, in the recordings and -	no
29637	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
29638	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right. So you just have to look over longer  time  when you're trying to align the things, you can't - you can't just look -	no
29639	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well. are you talking about the fact that the recording software doesn't do time-synchronous? Is that what you're referring to?	no
29640	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	@@	no
29641	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	That seems to me you can do that over the entire file and get a  very  accurate -	no
29642	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I don't thi-	no
29643	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I d-	no
29644	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I don't think  that  was the  issue.  The issue was that you  have  -	no
29645	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I - yeah, that was sort of a side issue.	no
29646	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I  didn't think so  either.	no
29647	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	to - you  have  have -	no
29648	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	you  first  have to have a pretty good  speech  detection on the individual  channels.	no
29649	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	And it's dynamic, so I guess it was more dynamic than some simple models	no
29650	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	would be able t- to - so - so there are some things available, and I don't know too much about this area where	no
29651	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	if people aren't moving around much than you could apply them, and it should work pretty well if you took care of this recording time difference.	no
29652	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right, which should be pretty straight forward.	no
29653	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Which a- at least is well defined, and	no
29654	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
29655	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	um, but then if you add the dynamic aspect of adapting distances, then it wasn't -	no
29656	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I guess it just wasn't something that he could  do  quickly  and not - in time for us to be able to do something by two weeks from now, so. Well less than a week.	no
29657	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So - um, so I don't know what we can do if anything, that's sort of worth,	no
29658	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	you know, a Eurospeech paper at this point.	no
29659	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well, Andreas, how well did it work on the non-lapel stuff?	no
29660	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah. That's what I was gonna say. C-	no
29661	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I haven't  checked  those yet. It's very tedious to  check  these.	no
29662	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Mmm.	no
29663	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Um, we would  really  need, ideally, a  transcriber	no
29664	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	to  time  mark the -	no
29665	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	you know, the be- at  least  the beginning and s- ends  of contiguous speech.	no
29666	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Um,	no
29667	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	and,	no
29668	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	you know, then with the  time  marks, you can do an  automatic	no
29669	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	comparison of your -	no
29670	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	of your forced alignments.	no
29671	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh,  M_N_C_M .	no
29672	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Because - really the - the - at least in terms of how we were gonna  use  this in our  system  was	no
29673	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Mm-hmm.	no
29674	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	to get an ideal - an idea, uh, for each channel about the start and end boundaries. We don't really care about like intermediate word boundaries, so -	no
29675	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	No, that's how I've been  looking  at it. I mean, I don't care that the individual words are aligned correctly, but	no
29676	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
29677	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
29678	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
29679	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	you  don't  wanna,	no
29680	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	uh,  infer  from the  alignment  that someone spoke who  didn't.   @@  so, so -	no
29681	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right, exactly. So that's why I was wondering if it -	no
29682	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I mean, maybe if it doesn't work for lapel stuff, we can just not use that and -	no
29683	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
29684	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I haven't -	no
29685	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I ha- just haven't had the time to, um,	no
29686	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	do the same procedure on one of the -	no
29687	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	so I would need a k- I would need a channel that has	no
29688	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	a speaker whose -	no
29689	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	who has a  lot  of overlap but s-	no
29690	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	you know, is a	no
29691	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	non-lapel mike.	no
29692	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	And, um,	no
29693	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	where preferably, also there's someone sitting  next  to them	no
29694	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	who talks a lot.	no
29695	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Hmm!	no
29696	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So,	no
29697	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	@@  So a meeting with  me  in it.	no
29698	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I - maybe someone can help me find a good candidate and then I would	no
29699	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	be willing to	no
29700	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	We c- you know what? Maybe the best way to find that would be to look through  these.	no
29701	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	you know, hand-	no
29702	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Cuz you can see the seat numbers, and then you can see what type of  mike  they were using.	no
29703	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	And so we just look for, you know, somebody sitting next to  Adam	no
29704	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	at one of the meetings -	no
29705	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Actually y- we can tell from the data that we have, um, yeah, there's a way to tell. It might not be a single person who's always overlapping that person but any number of people, and,	no
29706	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	From the insertions, maybe?	no
29707	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	fr-	no
29708	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	fr- from the -	no
29709	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
29710	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	um, if you align the two	no
29711	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	hypothesis files across the channels, you know, just word alignment, you'd be able to find that.	no
29712	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So -	no
29713	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	so I guess that's sort of a last -	no
29714	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	ther- there're sort of a few things we could do. One is just do like non-lapels if we can get good enough alignments. Another one was to try to get -	no
29715	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	somehow align Thilo's energy segmentations with	no
29716	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	what we have. But then you have the problem of not knowing where the words are because these meetings were done before that segmentation. But maybe there's something that could be done.	no
29717	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	What - what is - why do you need the, um,	no
29718	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	the forced alignment for the H_L_T - I mean for the Eurospeech paper?	no
29719	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well,	no
29720	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I guess I - I wanted to just do something not on	no
29721	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	recognition experiments because that's ju- way too early, but to be able to report,	no
29722	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	you know, actual numbers. Like if we - if we had	no
29723	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	hand-transcribed pe- good alignments or hand-checked alignments, then we could do this paper. It's not that we need it to be automatic.	no
29724	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But without knowing where the real words are, in time -	no
29725	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So it was to get - it was to get more data and better - to - to squeeze the boundaries in.	no
29726	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	To - to know what an overlap really - if it's really an overlap, or if it's just a -	no
29727	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Ah, O_K. Yeah.	no
29728	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	a - a segment correlated with an overlap, and I guess that's the difference to me between like a real paper and a sort of, promissory paper.	no
29729	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So,	no
29730	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	um, if we d-	no
29731	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	it might be possible to take Thilo's output	no
29732	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	and like if you have, um,	no
29733	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	like right now these meetings are all,	no
29734	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Ugh!	no
29735	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I forgot the digital camera  again.  Every meeting!	no
29736	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	um,	no
29737	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	you know, they're time-aligned, so if these are two different channels	no
29738	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	and somebody's talking here and somebody else is talking here, just that word,	no
29739	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Mm-hmm.	no
29740	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	if Thilo can tell us that there're boundaries here, we should be able to figure that out because the only thing transcribed in this channel is this word.	no
29741	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But, um, you know, if there are things -	no
29742	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Two words.	no
29743	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, if you have two and they're at the edges, it's like here and here, and there's speech here, then it doesn't really help you, so, um -	no
29744	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Thilo's won't put down two separate marks in that case -	no
29745	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Thilo's  will. But.	no
29746	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well it w- it would, but, um, we don't know exactly where the words are because the transcriber gave us two words in this time bin and we don't really know,	no
29747	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I mean, yeah it's -	no
29748	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well it's a merging problem. If you had a - if you had a s- if you had a script which would - I've  thought  about this, um, and I've discussed - I've discussed it with Thilo,	no
29749	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I mean, if you have any ideas.  I would -	no
29750	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	um, the,	no
29751	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I mean, I - I - in principle I could imagine writing a script which would  approximate  it to  some  degree, but there is this problem of slippage, yeah.	no
29752	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well maybe -	no
29753	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Maybe that will get enough of the cases to be useful.	no
29754	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right. I mean, that - that would be really helpful. That was sort of another possibility.	no
29755	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	You know s- cuz it seemed like  most  of the cases  are  in fact the single word	no
29756	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	sorts, or at least a single phrase	no
29757	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Mmm.	no
29758	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	"Well they - they can be stretched. I wouldn't make that generalization cuz sometimes people will say, ""And then I"" and there's a long pause"	no
29759	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	in most of the bins.	no
29760	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
29761	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	and finish the sentence and - and sometimes it looks coherent and - and the - I mean it's - it's not a simple problem.	no
29762	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But it's really - And then it's coupled with the problem that sometimes, you know, with - with a fricative you might get the beginning of the word cut off and so it's coupled with the problem that Thilo's isn't	no
29763	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	perfect either. I mean, we've i- th- it's like you have a merging problem plus - so merging plus this problem of, uh, not -	no
29764	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
29765	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Hmm!	no
29766	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	y- i- i- if the speech-nonspeech were perfect to begin with, the detector, that would already be an improvement, but that's impossible, you know, i- that's too much to ask.	no
29767	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
29768	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yes.	no
29769	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	And so i-  and may-  you know, I mean, it's -	no
29770	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I think that there always - th- there would have to be some hand-tweaking, but it's  possible  that a script could be written to merge those two types of things. I've - I've  discussed  it with Thilo  and I mean  -	no
29771	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	in terms of not him doing it, but we - we discussed some of the parameters of that and how hard it would be to - in principle - to write something that would do that.	no
29772	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I mean, I guess in the future it won't be as much as an issue if	no
29773	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	transcribers are using the tightened boundaries to start with, then we have a	no
29774	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	good idea of where the forced alignment is constrained to. So I'm no- I don't know if this-	no
29775	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well, it's just, you know, a matter of we had the revolution - we had the revolution of improved, uh, interface, um, one month too late, but it's like,	no
29776	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh.	no
29777	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Tools.	no
29778	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh it's - it's a - yeah.	no
29779	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	you know, it's wonderful to have the revolution,  so it's just a matter of - of, you know, from now on we'll be able to have things channelized to begin with.	no
29780	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right. And we'll just have to  see  how  hard  that is.	no
29781	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, that's right. That's right.	no
29782	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So - so whether the corrections take too much time. I was just  thinking  about the fact that if Thilo's  missed  these short  segments,	no
29783	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
29784	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	that might be  quite   time-consuming  for them to  insert  them.	no
29785	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Good point.	no
29786	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But he - he also can adjust this minimum time duration constraint and then what you get is	no
29787	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
29788	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Spurious.	no
29789	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	noises mostly, but that might be O_K, an-	no
29790	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	It might be easier to delete something that's  wrong  than to insert something that's missing. What do you think, Jane?	no
29791	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right. And you can also see in the waveform - exac- yeah.	no
29792	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	If you can feel confident that what the - yeah, that there's actually something - that you're not gonna miss something, yeah.	no
29793	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
29794	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah. Cuz then - then you just delete it, and you don't have to pick a time.	no
29795	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I think it's -	no
29796	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well the problem is I - you know - I - I - it's a - it's a really good question, and I really find it a pain in the neck to delete things because you have to get the mouse up there	no
29797	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	on the t- on the text line and i- and otherwise you just use an arrow to get down - I mean, i- it depends on how lar-  @@  th- there's so many	no
29798	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	extra things that would make it	no
29799	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	one of them harder than the other, or - or vice versa. It's not a simple question. But, you know, I mean, in principle, like, you know, if one of them is easier then to bias it towards whichever one's easier.	no
29800	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, I guess the semantics aren't clear when you delete a segment, right? Because you would say - You would have to determine what the surroundings were.	no
29801	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	You could just say it's a noise, though, and write, you know, a post-processor will just -	no
29802	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	all you have to do is just -	no
29803	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	If it's really a noise.	no
29804	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	"or just say it's - just put ""X_,"" you know, like ""not speech"" or something, and then you can get -"	no
29805	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I think it's easier to add than delete, frankly, because you have to, uh, maneuver around on the - on  both  windows  then.	no
29806	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, or-	no
29807	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	To add or to delete?	no
29808	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	To delete.	no
29809	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	O_K.	no
29810	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Anyways, so I - I guess -	no
29811	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	That - Maybe that's an interface issue that might be addressable. But I think it's the semantics that are - that are  questionable  to me, that you delete something - So let's say someone is talking to here,	no
29812	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	It's possible.	no
29813	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	and then you have a little segment here.	no
29814	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well, is that part of the speech? Is it part of the nonspeech?	no
29815	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I mean, w- what do you embed it in?	no
29816	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	There's something nice, though, about keeping,	no
29817	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	and this is probably another discussion, keeping the stuff that Thilo's detector detected as possible speech and just marking it as not speech than	no
29818	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	deleting it. Because then when you align it, then the alignment can - you can put a reject model or whatever, and you're consistent with th- the automatic system, whereas if you delete it -	no
29819	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	"Oh, I see. So then they could just like put - Oh that's what you meant by just put an ""X_"" there."	no
29820	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Uh,  that's  an interesting idea.	no
29821	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	"So - so all they - So that all they would have to do is put like an ""X_"" there."	no
29822	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, or some, you know, dummy reject mod-	no
29823	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So blank for -	no
29824	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	"blank for silence, ""S_"" for speech, ""X_"" for"	no
29825	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	whatever, yeah. That's actually a better way to do it cuz the a- the forced alignment will probably be more consistent than -	no
29826	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	something else.	no
29827	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well, like, I think there's a complication which is that - that you can have speech and noise in s-	no
29828	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I mean if it's just as easy, but -	no
29829	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	uh, you know, on the same channel, the same  speaker,  so now sometimes you get a ni- microphone pop and,	no
29830	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	uh, I mean, there're these fuzzy hybrid cases,	no
29831	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	and then the problem with the boundaries that have to be shifted around.	no
29832	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	It's not a simple - not a simple problem.	no
29833	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Anyway, quick question, though, at a high level do people think,	no
29834	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	let's just say that we're moving to this new era of like using the, um, pre-segmented t- you know, non-synchronous	no
29835	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	conversations, does it make sense to try to take what we have now, which are the ones that, you know, we have recognition on which are synchronous and not time-tightened, and try to	no
29836	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	get something out of those for sort of purposes of illustrating the structure and the nature of the meetings, or is it better to just,	no
29837	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	you know, forget that and tr- I mean, it's -	no
29838	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well, I think we'll  have  to, eventually.	no
29839	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	And my  hope  was that we would be able to use the forced  alignment  to  get  it.  But if we  can't  -	no
29840	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right. That was everybody's hope.	no
29841	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	And maybe we can for the non-lapel, but is it worth - if we can't then we can fake it even if we're - we report, you know, we're wrong twenty percent of the time or ten percent of the time.	no
29842	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But if we can't, then maybe we just have to -	no
29843	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well, I'm thinking - are you talking about for a  paper,  or are talking about for the  corpus.	no
29844	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Uh - uh, that's a good question actually.	no
29845	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I mean cuz for the  corpus  it would be nice if everything were -	no
29846	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Actually that's a good question because we'd have to completely redo those meetings, and we have like ten of them now.	no
29847	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	We wouldn't have to re- do  them, we would just have to  edit  them.	no
29848	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well, and  also,  I mean, I still haven't - I still haven't given up on forced alignment. I think that when Brian comes, this'll be uh an interesting aspect to ask him as well b-	no
29849	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	No, you're right, actually -	no
29850	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	When -	no
29851	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	when Brian Kingsbury comes.	no
29852	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	"Oh,  Brian.  You s- I thought you said  Ryan.  And it's like, ""Who's Ryan?"" O_K."	no
29853	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, good question. Well,  Ryan  could come.	no
29854	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Uh, no, that's a good point, though, because for feature extraction like for prosody or something, I mean, the meetings we have now, it's a good chunk of data -	no
29855	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yep.	no
29856	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	we need to get a decent f- O_K.	no
29857	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So we should at least try it even if we can't, right?	no
29858	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	That's what  my  hope has been, and that's what - that's what - you know, ever since the - the February meeting that I transcribed from last year,	no
29859	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	forced alignment has been on the - on the table as a way of cleaning  them   up later. And - and so I'm  hopeful  that that's possible. I know that there's complication in the  overlap  sections and with the  lapel  mikes, but -	no
29860	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	On the table, right?	no
29861	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	There's -	no
29862	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
29863	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I mean, we might be able, at the very worst, we can get transcribers to correct the cases where - I mean, you sort of have a good estimate where these places are because the recognition's so poor.	no
29864	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right? And so you're -	no
29865	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, we were  never  just gonna  go  with these as the final alignments. We were  always  gonna run  them   past somebody.	no
29866	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I agree. I agree.	no
29867	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
29868	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So we need some way to push these first chunk of meetings into a state where we get good alignments.	no
29869	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Absolutely.	no
29870	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I'm  probably  going to spend another day or so trying to	no
29871	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	improve things by, um,	no
29872	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	by using,	no
29873	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	um,	no
29874	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	acoustic adaptation.	no
29875	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Um,	no
29876	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	the -	no
29877	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right now I'm using	no
29878	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	the unadapted	no
29879	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	models for the	no
29880	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	forced alignments,	no
29881	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	and it's	no
29882	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	possible  that you get	no
29883	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	considerably better results if you, uh, manage to	no
29884	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	adapt the,	no
29885	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	uh,	no
29886	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	phone  models to the  speaker  and the  reject  model to the -	no
29887	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	to - to all the  other  speech.	no
29888	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Um,	no
29889	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	so	no
29890	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Could you - could you at the same time	no
29891	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	adapt the reject model to	no
29892	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	the speech from all the other channels?	no
29893	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	That's what he just said.	no
29894	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	That's what he was saying.	no
29895	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	That's  what I just  said.	no
29896	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
29897	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh, not just the speech from that - of the other people from  that  channel,	no
29898	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
29899	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
29900	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	but the speech from the a- actual  other  channels.	no
29901	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh, oh, I see. Um,	no
29902	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I don't think so. I don't think that would work, right? Because you'd - A lot of it's dominated by  channel  properties.	no
29903	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh.	no
29904	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	No, it -	no
29905	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	th-	no
29906	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Exactly.	no
29907	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So you want to u-	no
29908	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But what you do wanna do is take the, even if it's klugey, take the segments - the synchronous segments, the ones from the H_L_T paper, where only that speaker was talking. Use those for adaptation, cuz if you -	no
29909	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	if you use everything, then you get all the cross-talk in the adaptation, and it's just sort of blurred. And that we know, I mean, we have that. And it's about	no
29910	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	That's a good point.	no
29911	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yep.	no
29912	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	If you -	no
29913	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
29914	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	roughly two-thirds, I mean, very roughly averaged. That's not completely negligible. Like a third of it is bad for adaptation or so.	no
29915	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Mm-hmm.	no
29916	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Cool. I thought it was higher than that, that's pr-	no
29917	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	It really - it depends a lot. This is just sort of an overall -	no
29918	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So.	no
29919	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well I know what we're  not  turning in to Eurospeech,  a redo of the H_L_T paper.	no
29920	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
29921	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	That - I don't wanna do  that,  but.	no
29922	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, I'm doing that for AVIOS.	no
29923	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
29924	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But I think we're - oh, Morgan's talk went very well, I think. I think Morgan's talk went very well it woke - you know, it was really a well presented - and got people laughing -	yes
29925	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, I'm doing that for AVIOS.	no
29926	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But I think we're - oh, Morgan's talk went very well, I think. I think Morgan's talk went very well it woke - you know, it was really a well presented - and got people laughing -	no
29927	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Bleep.	no
29928	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	"Uh, ""bleep"". Yeah,  really."	no
29929	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Excellent.	no
29930	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Some good jokes in it?	no
29931	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
29932	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Especially the batteried meter popping up, that was hilarious. Right when you were talking about that.	no
29933	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
29934	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	You know, that wa- that was the battery meter saying that it was fully charged, yeah.	no
29935	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	It's full. Yeah.	no
29936	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	"You said, ""Speaking about energy"", or  something. That was very nice."	no
29937	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But that was funny.	no
29938	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	He - he - he was onto the bullet points about talking about	no
29939	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
29940	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Po- low power and -	no
29941	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	"the - you know - the little hand-held, and trying to get lower power and so on, and Microsoft pops up a little window saying ""Your batteries are now fully charged."""	no
29942	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, yeah, yeah.	no
29943	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	That's great.	no
29944	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	"I'm thinking about scripting that for my talk, you know, put - put a little script in there to say ""Your batteries are low"" right when I'm saying that."	no
29945	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
29946	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah. No I mean, i- in - in your case, I mean, you were joking about it, but, I mean, your case	no
29947	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	the fact that your talking about similar things at a couple of conferences, it's not -	no
29948	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	these are conferences that have d- really different emphases. Whereas H_L_T and - and Eurospeech, pretty -	no
29949	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Are too close, yeah.	no
29950	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	pretty - pretty similar, so I - I - I can't see really	no
29951	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	just putting in the same thing, but -	no
29952	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	No, I d- I don't think that paper is really -	no
29953	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	the H_L_T paper is really more of a introduction-to-the-project paper, and, um -	no
29954	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
29955	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, for Eurospeech we want some results  if we can get  them.	no
29956	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well, yeah, it - it's - probably wouldn't make sense, but -	no
29957	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Or some - or some - I mean,	no
29958	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I would see Eurospeech - if we have some Eurospeech papers, these will be paper p- p- uh, submissions. These will be things that are particular things,	no
29959	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	aspects of it that we're looking at, rather than, you know, attempt at a global paper about it.	no
29960	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Detail, yeah. Overall.	no
29961	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right, right.	no
29962	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I  did  go through one of these meetings. I had, uh, one of the transcribers go through and tighten up the bins on one of the, uh, N_S_A meetings, and then I went through afterwards and double-checked it so that one is really very -	no
29963	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh.	no
29964	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	very accurate. I men- I mentioned the link. I sent - You know that one?	no
29965	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh, so -	no
29966	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	The - which one? I'm sorry.	no
29967	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Um, I'm trying to remember - I don't remember the number off hand. It's one of the N_S_A's. I sent email before the conference, before last week.	no
29968	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Those are all -	no
29969	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh, O_K.	no
29970	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	That might - might have been the one - one of the ones that we did.	no
29971	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Bef- What I mean is Wednesday, Thursday.	no
29972	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Mm-hmm.	no
29973	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I'm sure that that one's accurate, I've been through it  myself.	no
29974	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	O_K.	no
29975	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So that might actually be useful but they're all non-native speakers.	no
29976	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So we could compare before and  after  and see -	no
29977	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah. Yeah, that's what I was gonna say. The problem with those, they're all German. So.	no
29978	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, that's the problem with the N_S_A speakers.	no
29979	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	oh,	no
29980	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	And e- and e- and  extremely  hard to follow, like word-wise, I bet the transcri- I mean, I have no idea what they're talking about, so, um,	no
29981	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Darn!	no
29982	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
29983	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I corrected it for a number of the words. I'm sure that, um, they're - they're accurate now.	no
29984	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Uh, actually I have to -	no
29985	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I mean, this is tough for a language model probably -	no
29986	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	to go.	no
29987	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
29988	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	but - but that might be useful just for	no
29989	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well.	no
29990	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	O_K, Andreas is leaving - leaving the building.	no
29991	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	speech.	no
29992	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Mm-hmm.	no
29993	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
29994	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	See ya.	no
29995	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	See ya.	no
29996	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Um, oh, before you l- go -	yes
29997	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Um, oh, before you l- go -	no
29998	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I don't think we'll go much longer.	no
29999	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I guess it's alright for you to talk a little without the mike - I noticed you adjusting the mike a lot, did it not fit you well?	no
30000	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh.	no
30001	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well I won- I noticed when you turned your head, it would - it would tilt.	no
30002	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Maybe it wasn't just tightened enough, or -	no
30003	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Maybe the - yeah, the s- thing that you have tightened  @@ , oh.	no
30004	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Actually if - if you have a larger head, that mike's gotta go farther away which means the - the balance is gonna make it wanna tip down.	no
30005	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	O_K.	no
30006	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Anyway.	no
30007	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah. O_K, see ya.	no
30008	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Cuz, I'm just thinking, you know, we were - we're - we've been  talking  about changing the mikes,	no
30009	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	@@	no
30010	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
30011	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	uh, for a while, and if these aren't -	no
30012	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	acoustically  they seem really good, but if they're not comfortable, we have the same problems we have with  these  stupid things.	no
30013	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I think it's com- This is the first time I've worn this, I find it very comfortable.	no
30014	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I find it very comfortable too, but, uh, it looked like Andreas was having problems, and I think Morgan was saying it -	no
30015	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well, but I had it on - I had it on this morning and it was fine.	no
30016	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Can I see that?	no
30017	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh, oh you did wear it this morning? O_K, it's  off,  so you can put it on.	no
30018	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
30019	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I - yeah, I don't want it on, I just -	no
30020	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I just want to, um,	no
30021	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	say what I think is a problem with this.	no
30022	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	If you are wearing this	no
30023	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	over your ears	no
30024	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	and you've got it all the way out here,	no
30025	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	then the balance is gonna want to pull it  this  way. Where as if somebody with a  smaller  head has it back  here,	no
30026	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
30027	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
30028	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	It's more balanced.	no
30029	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So we have to	no
30030	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	right? Yeah. Then it - then it falls back this way so it's -	no
30031	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh!	no
30032	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well wh- what it's supposed to do is the backstrap is supposed to be under your crown, and so that should be -  should  be -	no
30033	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	if it's right against your head there, which is what it's supposed to be, that balances it	no
30034	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Ah.	no
30035	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	so it doesn't slide up. Yep, right - right below - if you feel the back of your head, you feel a little lump,	no
30036	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So  this  is supposed to be	no
30037	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	under that little protuberance.	no
30038	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	um, and so it's supposed to be right under that.	no
30039	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
30040	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So it's really supposed to go more like  this  than like this. But then isn't  that  going to - Well, I guess you can control that.	no
30041	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yes, exactly.	no
30042	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	That - that - that tilts, right?	no
30043	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	In lots and lots of different ways.	no
30044	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So I'm not saying anything about bias towards small headsize, but	no
30045	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	About heads?	no
30046	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	It would be an advantage.	no
30047	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	does seem, uh -	no
30048	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well, wonder if it's - if - if he was wearing it over his hair instead of under his hair.	no
30049	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well, we should -	no
30050	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I think probably it was -	no
30051	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	We shou- we should work on compressing the heads, and -	no
30052	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.  It probably just wasn't tight enough to the back of his head.	no
30053	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I mean, so the directions do talk about  bending  it to your size,	no
30054	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	The  other  thing that would do it would be to hang a five pound  weight  off the back.	no
30055	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	which is not really what we want.	no
30056	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah  that's good!	no
30057	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
30058	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	What did you say?	no
30059	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	wh-	no
30060	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	A little, um,	no
30061	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Hang a five pound weight off the - off the back. Weight.	no
30062	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	We  did  that -	no
30063	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Hang a five pound weight off the back.	no
30064	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	We - at  Boeing  I used - I was doing augmented  reality  so they had  head-mounts  on, and we - we had a little jury-rigged one with a welder's helmet, and we had just a bag	no
30065	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Counter-balance.	no
30066	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	with a bunch of marbles in it  as a counter-balance.	no
30067	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Or maybe this could be helpful just for evening the conversation between people. If people - those who talk a lot have to wear heavier weights or something, and - and -	no
30068	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah!	no
30069	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	um,	no
30070	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Anyway.	no
30071	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	um,	no
30072	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	so, uh, what was I gonna say? Oh, yeah, I was gonna say, uh, I had these, uh, conversations with NIST folks also while I was there and - and, uh,	yes
30073	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	so, uh, what was I gonna say? Oh, yeah, I was gonna say, uh, I had these, uh, conversations with NIST folks also while I was there and - and, uh,	no
30074	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yep.	no
30075	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	um, so	no
30076	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	they - they have their - their plan for a room, uh, with, um,	no
30077	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	mikes in the middle of the table, and, uh, close-mounted mikes, and they're talking about close-mounted  and  lapels,	no
30078	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	just cuz sort of  -  and  the array. Yeah, so they were -	no
30079	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	And arrays, which is the i- interesting - and video, right.	no
30080	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	And arrays, yep. And cameras.	no
30081	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	And yeah, like multiple - multiple video cameras coverin- covering every - everybody - every place in the room,	no
30082	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	uh, the - yeah - the - the mikes in the middle, the head-mounted mikes, the lapel mikes, the array, uh, with - well, there's some discussion of fifty-nine, they might go down to fifty-seven	no
30083	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Fifty-nine elements.	no
30084	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Because, uh,	no
30085	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	there is, uh, some pressure from a couple people at the meeting for them to use a KEMAR head.	no
30086	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I forget what KEMAR, uh, stands for, but what it is is it's dummy head that is very specially designed, and -	no
30087	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Mm-hmm.	no
30088	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh, that's right. Yep.	no
30089	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right. That's a great idea.	no
30090	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	and - and, so what they're actually doing is they're really - there's really two recording systems. So they may not be precisely synchronous, but the-	no
30091	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	but there's two - two recording systems, one with, I think, twenty-four channels, and one with sixty-four channels. And the sixty-four channel one is for the array,	no
30092	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	but they've got some empty channels there, and anyway they - like they're saying they may	no
30093	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	give up a couple or something if - for - for the KEMAR head if they go - go with that.	no
30094	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
30095	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, it  is  a good idea.	no
30096	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, h- uh, J- Jonathan Fiscus did say that,	no
30097	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So.	no
30098	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	uh, they have lots of software for doing calibration for skew and offset between channels and that they've found that's just not a big deal.	no
30099	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Mm-hmm	no
30100	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
30101	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So.	no
30102	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, I'm not  too worried about that. I was thinking -	no
30103	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But they're still	no
30104	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	planning to do like fake - they have to do something like that, right.	no
30105	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Scenario-based.	no
30106	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Y- right. Their - their	no
30107	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	legal issues won't allow them to do otherwise.	no
30108	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
30109	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But it sounded like they were  pretty well thought out and they're - they're gonna be real meetings, it's just that they're with str- with people who would not be meeting otherwise. So.	no
30110	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, th- that's true.	no
30111	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Mm-hmm.	no
30112	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Mm-hmm.	no
30113	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Did - did they give a talk on this or was this informal?	no
30114	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	No. It's just informal.	no
30115	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	No.	no
30116	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	No, we just had some discussions, various discussions	no
30117	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah.	no
30118	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, I also sat and chatted with several of the NIST folks. They seemed like a good group.	no
30119	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	with them.	no
30120	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	What was the, um -	yes
30121	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, I also sat and chatted with several of the NIST folks. They seemed like a good group.	no
30122	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	What was the, um -	no
30123	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	the paper by, um, Lori Lamel that you mentioned?	no
30124	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Um,	no
30125	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Mmm, yeah.	no
30126	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	yeah, we sh- we should just have you - have you read it, but, I mea- ba- i- i- uh, we've all got these little proceedings, but, um,	no
30127	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	basically,	no
30128	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	it was about, um,	no
30129	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	uh, going to a new task where you have insufficient data and using - using data from something else, and adapting, and how well that works.	no
30130	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Uh, so in - in fact it was pretty related to what Liz and Andreas did, uh, except that this was not with meeting stuff, it was with	no
30131	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
30132	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	uh, like I think they s- didn't they start off with Broadcast News system? And then they went to -	no
30133	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	The- their Broadcast News was their acoustic models and then all the other tasks were much simpler.	no
30134	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
30135	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So they were command and control	no
30136	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	and that sort of thing.	no
30137	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	T_I-digits was one of them,	no
30138	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yep.	no
30139	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	and, uh,	no
30140	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Wall Street Journal.	no
30141	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	What was their	no
30142	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, read Wall Street Journal.	no
30143	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	rough - what was their conclusion?	no
30144	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	It works.	no
30145	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
30146	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well, it's - it's a good paper, I mean -	no
30147	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
30148	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, yeah.	no
30149	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, that was one of the ones that I liked. That - It not only works, in some cases it was  better,  which I thought was pretty interesting, but that's cuz they didn't control for parameters.	no
30150	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Bring the -	no
30151	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So.	no
30152	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	You know, the Broadcast News nets were - not  nets,   acoustic  models  were a lot more complex.	no
30153	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Probably.	no
30154	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
30155	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Did they ever try going -	no
30156	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	going the other direction from simpler task to more complicated tasks, or - ?	no
30157	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	n-	no
30158	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Not in that paper.	no
30159	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	That might be hard.	no
30160	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, well,	no
30161	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	one of the big  problems  with that is - is often the simpler task isn't fully - doesn't have all the  phones  in it,  and that - that makes it very hard.	no
30162	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
30163	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Mm-hmm.	no
30164	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
30165	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But  I've  done the same thing. I've been using Broadcast News nets for digits,	no
30166	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
30167	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	like for the spr- speech proxy thing that I did? That's what I did.	no
30168	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, sure.	no
30169	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So. It works.	no
30170	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
30171	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, and they have - I mean - they have better adaptation than we had than that - that system, so they -	no
30172	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yep.	no
30173	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	um,	no
30174	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	You mean they have  some.	no
30175	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	yeah, we should probably what would - actually what we should do, uh, I haven't said anything about this, but probably the five of us should	no
30176	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	pick out a paper or two	no
30177	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	that - that, uh, you know, got our interest, and we should	no
30178	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	go around the room at one of the Tuesday lunch meetings and say, you know, what - what was good about the conference, yeah.	no
30179	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Present.	no
30180	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yep.	no
30181	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Do a trip report.	no
30182	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well, the summarization stuff was interesting, I mean, I don't know anything about that field, but for this proposal	no
30183	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	on meeting summarization,	no
30184	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	um, I mean, it's sort of a far cry because they weren't working with meeting type data, but	no
30185	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
30186	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	he  got sort of an overview on some of the different approaches,	no
30187	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Do you remember who the groups were that we're doing?	no
30188	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	so.	no
30189	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well there're - this was the last day, but, I mean, there's - that's a huge field and probably the groups there may not be representative of the field, I - I don't know exactly	no
30190	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	A  lot  of different ones.	no
30191	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	R- I think - Mm-hmm.	no
30192	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	that everyone submits to this particular conference, but	no
30193	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Was - were there folks from B_B_N presenting?	no
30194	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	yet there was, let's see,	no
30195	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	this was on the last day, Mitre, B_B_N,	no
30196	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Mitre, B_B_N, I_B_M.	no
30197	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	and, um,  Prager  -	no
30198	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Uh,	no
30199	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Maryland.	no
30200	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	um,	no
30201	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I wo- it was - no it was - this was Wednesday morning.	no
30202	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Columbia have anything? No.	no
30203	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Wasn't -	no
30204	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Who - who - who did the  order  one?	no
30205	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	The sentence ordering one,	no
30206	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	was that  Barselou , and these guys?	no
30207	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Ugh!  I'm just so bad at that.	no
30208	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh.	no
30209	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Anyway, I - I - it's in the program, I should have read it to remind myself, but that's sort of useful and I think	no
30210	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	like when Mari and Katrin and Jeff are here it'd be good to figure out some kinds of	no
30211	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	things that we can start doing maybe just on the transcripts cuz we already have -	no
30212	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Mm-hmm.	no
30213	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, we  do  have word transcripts. So.	no
30214	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	you know, yeah.	no
30215	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well, I like the idea that  Adam  had of - of, um, z- maybe	no
30216	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	generating  minutes  based on some of these things that we  have  because it would be easy to - to - to  do  that just,	no
30217	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
30218	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	you know, and - and it has to be, though, someone from this  group  because of the technical nature of the thing.	no
30219	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Someone who actually  does  take notes, um,  I'm very bad at note-taking.	no
30220	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But I think what's interesting is there's all these different evaluations, like -	no
30221	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I always write down the wrong things.	no
30222	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	just, you know, how do you evaluate whether the summary is good or not, and that's what's - was sort of interesting to me is that there's different ways to do it, and -	no
30223	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I  do  take notes.	no
30224	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	A judge.	no
30225	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yep.	no
30226	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Was S_R_A one of the groups	no
30227	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	talking about summarization, no?	no
30228	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Hm-umm .	no
30229	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	No.	no
30230	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	It  was  an interesting session. One of those w-	no
30231	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	And as I said, I like the Microsoft talk on  scaling issues in, uh, word sense disambiguation, that was interesting.	no
30232	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
30233	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, that was an interesting discussion, uh,	no
30234	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	The -	no
30235	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I	no
30236	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	It - it - it was the  only   one  -	no
30237	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	The data issue comes up all the ti-	no
30238	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	It was the  only   one  that had any sort of real disagreement about.  So.	no
30239	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well, I didn't have as much disagreement as I would have liked, but I didn't wanna - I wouldn- I didn't wanna get into it because, uh, you know, it was	no
30240	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	the application was one I didn't know anything about, uh, it just would have been, you know, me getting up to be argumentative, but -	no
30241	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yep.	no
30242	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	but, uh, I mean, the missing thi- so - so what they were saying - it's one of these things - is - you know, all you need is more data, sort of -	no
30243	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But I mea- i- wh- it -  @@  that's - that's dissing it, uh, improperly, I mean, it was a nice study. Uh, they were doing this - it wasn't word-sense disambiguation, it was - was it w- was it word-sense? Yes.	no
30244	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well, it  sort  of was.	no
30245	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah - yeah - yeah -	no
30246	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	"But it was - it was a very simple case of ""to"" versus ""too"" versus ""two"" and ""there"", ""their"", ""they're"" -"	no
30247	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	And there and their and - and that you  could  do better with more data, I mean, that's clearly statistically -	no
30248	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, yeah. O_K.	no
30249	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
30250	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
30251	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	And so, what they did was they had these different kinds of learning machines,	no
30252	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	"and they had different amounts of data, and so they did like, you know, eight different methods that everybody, you know, uh, argues about - about, ""Oh my - my kind of learning machine is better than your kind of learning machine."""	no
30253	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	And, uh, they were - started off with a million words that they used, which was evidently a number that a lot of people doing that particular kind of task had been using.	no
30254	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So they went up, being Microsoft, they went up to a billion.	no
30255	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	And then they had this log scale showing a -  @@   you know, and - and naturally everything gets -	no
30256	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Them being  beep,   they went off to a billion.	no
30257	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	they - well, it's a big company,  @@  I didn't - I didn't mean it as a ne- anything negative, but i- i- i-	no
30258	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
30259	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	You mean the bigger the company the more words they use for training?	no
30260	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well, I think	no
30261	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	the reason they can  do  that, is that they assumed that text that they get off the web, like from Wall Street Journal, is correct, and edit it.	no
30262	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So that's what they used as training data. It's just saying if it's in this corpus it's correct.	no
30263	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
30264	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	O_K. But, I mean, yes. Of course there was the kind of effect that, you know, one would expect that - uh - that you got better and better performance with more and more data.	no
30265	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Um, but the - the real point was that	no
30266	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	the - the different learning machines are sort of all over the place, and - and by - by going up significantly in data you can have much bigger effect	no
30267	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	then by switching learning machines and furthermore which learning machine was on top kind of depended on where you were in this picture, so, uh,	no
30268	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	This was my concern about the recognizer in Aurora.	no
30269	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	That -	no
30270	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	That the differences we're seeing in the front-end	no
30271	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
30272	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Are irrelevant.	no
30273	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	is b- are  irrelevant  once you get a real recognizer at the  back-end.	no
30274	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
30275	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	If you add more data? Or -	no
30276	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
30277	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	You know?	no
30278	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Huh.	no
30279	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, could well be.	no
30280	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	So - so, I mean, that was - that was kind of, you know, it's a good point,	no
30281	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	but the problem I had with it was that the implications out of this was that,	no
30282	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	uh, the kind of choices you make about learning machines were therefore irrelevant	no
30283	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	which is not at - n- t- as for as I know in - in tasks I'm more familiar with  @@  is not at all true.	no
30284	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	What i- what is - is true is that different learning machines have different properties,	no
30285	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	and you wanna know what those properties are. And someone else sort of implied that well we s- you know, a- all the study of learning machine we still don't know what those properties are.	no
30286	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	We don't know them perfectly, but we know	no
30287	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	that some kinds use more memory and - and some other kinds use more computation and some are - are hav- have limited kind of discrimination, but are just easy to use, and others are -	no
30288	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But doesn't their conclusion just sort of - you could have  guessed  that before they even  started?  Because	no
30289	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	if you assume that these learning things get better and better and better,	no
30290	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	You would guess -	no
30291	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	then as you approach - there's a point where you can't get  any  better, right? You get everything right. So they're all  approaching.	no
30292	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
30293	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	It's just no -	no
30294	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But - No, but there was still a spread. They weren't all up- They weren't converging. They were all still spread.	no
30295	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	It w-	no
30296	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But what I'm saying is that th- they  have  to, as they all get better, they  have  to get closer together.	no
30297	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But they - Right, right. Sure. But	no
30298	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	they hadn't even come close to that point.  All  the tasks were still improving when they hit a billion.	no
30299	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
30300	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But they're all going the same  way,  right? So you  have  to get  closer.	no
30301	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Eventually. O- one would thi-	no
30302	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But they  didn't  get closer.	no
30303	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Oh they  didn't?	no
30304	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	They just switched position.	no
30305	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well -	no
30306	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	well that's getting cl- I mean,	no
30307	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	yeah, the spread was still pretty wide that's th- that's true, but - but, uh,	no
30308	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yep.	no
30309	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	I think it would be irntu- intu- intuition that this would be the case, but, uh, to really see it and to have the intuition is quite different, I mean, I think somebody  w- w-	no
30310	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	let's see who  was talking about earlier that the effect of having a lot more data is quite different in Switchboard than it is in - in Broadcast News, yeah.	no
30311	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Well it's different for different tasks. So it depends a lot on whether, you know, it - disambiguation is exactly the case where more data is better, right? You're -	no
30312	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah. It was Liz. Yeah.	no
30313	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
30314	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	you're - you can assume similar distributions, but if you wanted to do disambiguation on a different type of,	no
30315	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	uh, test data then your training data, then that extra data  wouldn't  generalize, so.	no
30316	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
30317	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But, I think one of their p-	no
30318	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
30319	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	They - they had a  couple  points. w-  Uh,	no
30320	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	"I think  one  of them was that ""Well, maybe simpler algorithms and more data are - is better"". Less memory, faster operation, simpler."	no
30321	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right? Because their simplest, most brain-dead algorithm did pretty darn well	no
30322	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Mm-hmm.	no
30323	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	when you got - gave it a lot more data. And then  also	no
30324	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	"they were saying, ""Well, m- You  have  access to a lot more data. Why are you sticking with a million words?"" I mean, their point was that this million-word corpus that everyone uses is apparently ten or fifteen years old."	no
30325	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	And everyone is still using it, so.	no
30326	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah.	no
30327	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But anyway, I - I - I think it's - it's just the - the i- it's - it's - it's not really the conclusion  they  came to so much,	no
30328	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	But we could talk about this stuff, I think this would be fun to do.	no
30329	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Ha!	no
30330	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	as the conclusion	no
30331	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	that some of the, uh, uh, commenters in the crowd  came up with that, uh, you know, this therefore is further evidence that, you know, more data is really all you should care about, and that I thought was just kind of	no
30332	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
30333	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	going too far the other way, and - and the - the, uh,	no
30334	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Machine-learning.	no
30335	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	one - one person ga- g- g- got up and made a - a brief defense, uh, but it was a different kind of grounds, it was that - that, uh,	no
30336	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	i- w- the reason people were not using so much data before was not because they were stupid or didn't realize data was important, but in fact th- they didn't have it available.	no
30337	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Um, but the other point to make a- again is that, uh, machine learning still does matter,	no
30338	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	but it - it matters more in some situations than in others, and it - and also there's - there's not just mattering	no
30339	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	or not mattering, but there's mattering in different ways. I mean, you might be in some situation where	no
30340	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	you care how much memory you're using,	no
30341	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Right.	no
30342	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	or you care, you know, what recall time is, or you care, you know, and - and -	no
30343	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Or you only  have  a million words	no
30344	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, or - or, uh -	no
30345	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	for your - some new task.	no
30346	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	"Or done another language, or - I mean, you - so there's papers on portability and rapid prototyping and blah-blah-blah, and then there's people saying, ""Oh, just add more data."" So, these are like two different religions, basically."	no
30347	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yep.	no

30364	transcript	transcript_Bmr018	Yeah, that's it. So, I mean, this was a very provocative slide. She put this up, and it was like this is -	no

30573	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Right.	no
30574	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	that needs to be   adjusted,  because, I mean, these are very highly technical things. I mean, it's an added, uh, level of checking on the accuracy of the  transcription,  as  I  see it. But in any case, people  can  agree to things that are  wrong.   So.	no
30575	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Well -	no
30576	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah. The reason I did that it was just so that people would not censor - not ask to have stuff removed because it was  transcribed  incorrectly,	no
30577	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	And the reason  I  liked it was because -	no
30578	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	as opposed to, uh -	no

30618	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Mm-hmm.	no

30620	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	n- no m- no overlap with our present members.	no
30621	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	And then maybe it'd be good to set an explicit deadline, something like  a week  before that, uh, J- July fifteenth date, or two weeks before.	no
30622	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I mean, I would suggest we discuss - I mean, if we're going to have a  policy  on it, that we discuss the length of time that we want to give people,	no
30623	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Mm-hmm.	no
30624	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	so that we have a uniform thing. So, tha- that's a month, which is fine. I mean, it seems -	no
30625	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Well, the only thing I said in the email is that  the data is going to be  released  on the fifteenth. I didn't  give  any other deadline.	no

30635	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Well.  That's true. I - I agree with that part, but I think that it would - it, uh - we need to have, uh, a - a - a message to them very clearly that	no

30745	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	but you should probably have a  legal person  look  at this and  make sure it's O_K. Because if you - if you, uh,  do  this	no
30746	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	and you - then there's a  dispute  later and, uh, some -	no
30747	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	you know, someone who  understands  these matters concludes that they didn't  have,  uh, you know, enough opportunity to actually	no
30748	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	exercise their - their right -	no
30749	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Or they - they might never have gotten the  email,  because although they signed this, they don't know by which date to expect your  email.	no
30750	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	And so  someone whose machine is down or whatever - I mean,	no
30751	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Mm-hmm.	no
30752	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	we have no - in-  internally  we know that people are there, but we have no confirmation that they got the mail.	no
30753	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Well, O_K. l- Let me - Let me  reverse  this.	no
30754	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	So let's say someone - I send this out, and someone doesn't  respond.	no
30755	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Do we delete every meeting that they were  in?	no
30756	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I don't  think  so.	no

30758	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	No.	no
30759	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	It - we're hoping that doesn't happen, but that's why there's such a thing as registered mail or -	no
30760	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	That  will  happen.	no
30761	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	That  will  happen.	no
30762	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Right.	no
30763	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	That  will   absolutely  happen.	no

30765	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Maybe - uh, do we have mailing  addresses   for these people?	no
30766	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	No. We have  what  they put on the speaker form, which was just generic contact information.	no
30767	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	No.	no
30768	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Well -	no
30769	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Oh.	no
30770	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Most -	no
30771	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	But the ones that we're dealing with now are  all   local,  except the ones who - I mean, we - we're  totally  in contact with all the ones in those two groups.	no

30774	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	O_K.	no
30775	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	So maybe, uh, I - you know, that's not that many people and if I - if, uh -	no
30776	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	i- i- there  is  an advantage to having them admit - and if I can help with - with processing that, I will. It's - it's - there  is  an advantage to having them be on record as having received the mail and indicating -	no
30777	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah. I mean I  thought  we had  discussed  this, like, a  year  ago. And so it seems like this is a little odd for it to be coming up  yet   again.	no

30779	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	You're right.	no

30783	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	That's right.	no
30784	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	You'll either wonder  at the beginning or you'll wonder at the end.	no
30785	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Need to get it right.	no
30786	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I mean, there's no way to get around -	no
30787	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I- It's pretty much the same am- amount of work except for an additional email just saying they  got  the email. And maybe it's better legally to	no
30788	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
30789	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	wonder  before  - you know, a little bit earlier than -	no
30790	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Well -	no
30791	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	It's much easier to  explain   this way. T- t- to have it on record.	no
30792	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	O_K. Well, why don't you talk  t- Morgan, can you talk to our lawyer about it,	no
30793	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	and find out what the status is on this? Cuz I don't wanna do something that we don't  need  to. Because	no
30794	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah, but w- Mmm.	no
30795	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	what - I'm  telling  you, people won't respond to the email.	no
30796	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	No matter what you do, you- there're gonna be people who  you're gonna have to make a  lot  of  effort  to get in contact with.	no
30797	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I mean, i- it's k-	no
30798	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Well, then we make the effort.	no
30799	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Hmm.	no
30800	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	And do we want to  spend  that effort?	no
30801	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	It's kind of like signing up for a  mailing  list. They have opt in and opt out. And there are two different ways. I mean, and either way  works   probably, I mean.	no
30802	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	We make the effort.	no
30803	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Except I really think in this case - I - I'm agr- I agree with Liz, that we need to be  in the clear	no
30804	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	"and not have to after the fact say ""oh, but I assumed"", and ""oh, I'm sorry that your email address was just accumulating mail without notifying you"", you know."	no
30805	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	If this is a purely administrative task, we can actually have  administration  do it.	no
30806	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Oh, excellent.	no
30807	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	But the thing is that, you know, I - I - I think, without going through a whole expensive thing with our lawyers,	no
30808	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	from my  previous  conversations with them, my - my sense very  much is that we would want something	no
30809	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	on record  as indicating that they actually were  aware  of this.	no
30810	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yes.	no
30811	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Well, we had  talked  about this  before  and I thought that we had	no
30812	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Mm-hmm.	no
30813	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	even gone by the  lawyers   asking  about that and they said	no

30829	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	O_K.	no
30830	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	a ploy like they use to, um -	no
30831	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	you know, that when they serve, like -	no
30832	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	uh, uh, uh -	no
30833	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	uh, you know, like dead-beat dads, they - they - they make it look like they won something in the lottery  and then they open the envelope and that -	no
30834	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	And they're served.	no
30835	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Right? Because - and then the - the - the - the thing is served.	no
30836	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	"So you just make it, you know, ""oh, you won - you know, go to this web site and you've, uh - you're -"""	no
30837	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	That's why you never open these things that come in the mail.	no
30838	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	That one.	no
30839	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Right.	no
30840	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Well, it's just, we've gone from one extreme to the other, where	no
30841	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
30842	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Right. No, it- I - it might -	no
30843	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	at one point, a few months ago, Morgan was - you were saying let's not do  anything,  and now we're -	no
30844	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Well, it doesn't matter.	no
30845	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	i- i-	no
30846	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	it - it might well be the case - it might -	no
30847	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	we're saying we have to follow up each person and get a  signature?  I mean, what are we gonna doing here?	no
30848	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Right.	no
30849	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	It might well be the case that - that this is perfectly -	no
30850	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Well .	no
30851	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	you know, this is enough to give us a basis t- to just, eh,	no
30852	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	assume their consent if they don't reply.  But, I'm not - you know, me not being a  lawyer,  I wouldn't	no
30853	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Mm-hmm.	no
30854	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	just wanna  do  that without  having the - the expert, uh, opinion on that.	no
30855	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	And how many people? Al- altogether we've got twenty people. These people are people who read their email almost all the time.	no
30856	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Then I think we had better find out, so that we can find a -	no
30857	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
30858	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Let me look at this again.	no
30859	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Right.	no
30860	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I - I really don't see that it's a problem. I - I think that it's a common courtesy to ask them -	no
30861	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	For - for th-	no
30862	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	uh, to  expect  for them to, uh, be able to  have	no
30863	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	@@   us try to contact them, u- just in case they hadn't gotten their email. I think they'd appreciate it.	no
30864	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah. My - Adam, my - my view before was about  the nature of what was - of the presentation,	no
30865	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Mm-hmm.	no
30866	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	of - of  how   my - my - the things that we're questioning were along the lines of how easy -	no
30867	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	uh, h- how m-	no
30868	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	how much implication would there be that it's  likely  you're going to be changing something, as opposed to - That was the kind of dispute I was making before.	no
30869	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Mm-hmm.	no
30870	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Mm-hmm. I remember that.	no
30871	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	But, um, the  attorneys,  I - uh, I can  guarantee  you, the attorneys will  always  come back with - and we have to decide how	no
30872	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	stringent  we want to  be  in these things,  but they will  always  come back with saying	no
30873	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	that, um, you need to - you want to have someth- some paper trail or - which includes electronic trail -	no
30874	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	that they have, uh, in fact  O_ K'd  it.	no
30875	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Mm-hmm.	no
30876	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	So, um,	no
30877	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I think that if you f- i- if  we send the email as you have and if there's	no
30878	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	half  the people, say, who don't respond  at  all  by, you know, some period of time,	no
30879	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	we can just make a  list  of these people and hand it to, uh -	no
30880	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	"you know, just give it to me and I'll hand it to administrative staff or whatever, and they'll just call them up and say, you know, ""have you -"	no
30881	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Right.	no
30882	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	"Is - is this O_K? And would you please mail - you know, mail Adam that it  is,  if i- if it, you know, is or not."""	no
30883	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	So, you know, we can - we can do that.	no
30884	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	The other thing that there's a psychological effect that -	no
30885	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	"at least for  most  people, that if they've responded to your email saying ""yes, I will do it"" or ""yes, I got your email"", they're more likely to actually  do  it   later  than to just  ignore  it."	no
30886	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Mm-hmm.	no
30887	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	And of course we don't  want  them to  bleep  things  out,  but it -	no
30888	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	it's a little bit better if we're getting the -	no
30889	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	their, uh, final response, once they've answered you  once  than if they never answer you'd  at al- at  all.	no
30890	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	That's how these mailing houses work. So, I mean, it's not  completely  lost work because it might benefit us in terms of getting  responses.	no
30891	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Mm-hmm.	no
30892	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	You know, an official O_K from somebody  is better than no answer, even if they responded that they got your email.	no
30893	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	And they're probably more likely to do that once they've responded that they got the email.	no
30894	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I also think they'd just simply  appreciate  it. I think it's a good - a good way of - of	no
30895	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	fostering goodwill among our subjects.	no
30896	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Well, our  participants.	no
30897	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I think the main thing is - I mean, what lawyers do is they always look at worst cases. So they s- so - so - Tha- that's what they're paid to do.	no
30898	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Sending lots of spam.	no
30899	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yep.	no
30900	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	And so,  it  is  certainly possible that, uh, somebody's server would be down or  something  and they wouldn't actually	no
30901	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	hear  from us, and then they find this thing is  in  there and we've already distributed it to someone. So,	no
30902	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	what it  says  in there, in fact, is that they will be given an opportunity to blah-blah-blah,	no
30903	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Mm-hmm.	no
30904	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	but if in fact - if we  sent  them something or we  thought  we sent them something but they didn't  actually   receive  it for some reason,	no
30905	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	um, then we  haven't  given them that.	no
30906	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Well, so  how   far  do we have to go? Do we need to get someone's signature?	no
30907	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Or, is email enough? Do we have to have it notarized?  I mean -	no
30908	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I- i- i- em- email is enough.	no
30909	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	O_K.	no
30910	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah. I mean, I've been through this - I mean, I'm not a lawyer, but I've been through these things a f- things f- like this a few times with lawyers now so I - I	no
30911	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Mm-hmm.	no
30912	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I- I'm pretty comfortable with that.	no
30913	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Do you track, um,	no
30914	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	when people log in	no
30915	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Uh. If they submit the  form,  I get it.	no
30916	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	to look at the - ?	no
30917	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Uh-huh.	no
30918	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	If they don't submit the form, it goes in the general web log. But that's not sufficient.	no
30919	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Hmm.	no
30920	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Right? Cuz if someone just visits the web site that doesn't  imply anything in particular.	no
30921	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Except that you know they got the mail.	no
30922	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Mm-hmm. That's right. I - I could get you on the notify list if you want me to.	no
30923	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Right.	no
30924	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I'm already on it.	no
30925	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	For that directory? O_K, great.	no
30926	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Mm-hmm.	no
30927	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	So again,  hopefully,  um, this shouldn't be quite as odious	no
30928	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	a problem  either  way, uh, in  any  of the extremes we've talked about because	no
30929	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	uh, we're talking a pretty small  number of people.	no
30930	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	W-	no
30931	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	For  this  set, I'm not worried, because  we basically know everyone on it.	no
30932	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Mm-hmm.	no
30933	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Hmm.	no
30934	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Mm-hmm.	no
30935	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	You know, they're all more or less here or it's - it's Eric and Dan and so on.	no
30936	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	But for some of the others, you're talking about visitors who are  gone from ICSI,	no
30937	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Mm-hmm.	no
30938	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	whose email addresses may or may not work,	no
30939	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Oh.	no
30940	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Mm-hmm.	no
30941	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	and -	no
30942	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	So what are we gonna  do  when we run into someone that we can't get in touch with?	no
30943	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I don't think, uh - They're so recent, these visitors. I - and - and I - they're also so -	no
30944	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Mm-hmm.	no
30945	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Mm-hmm.	no
30946	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	They're prominent enough that they're easy to find through - I - I mean, I - I w- I'll be able to - if you have  any  trouble finding them, I really think I could find them.	no
30947	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Other methods?	no
30948	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	O_K.	no
30949	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah. Cuz it - what it - what it  really   does  promise here is that we will ask their permission.	no
30950	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Um, and I think, you know, if you go into a room and close the door and - and ask their permission  and they're not there, it doesn't seem	no
30951	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	that that's the intent of, uh, meaning here. So.	no
30952	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Well, the qu- the  question  is just whether - how active it has to be.	no
30953	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I mean, because they - they filled out a contact information and that's where I'm sending the information.	no
30954	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Right.	no
30955	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	And so far everyone has done email. There isn't anyone who did, uh,	no
30956	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	any other contact method.	no
30957	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Well, the way ICSI goes, people, uh, who, uh, were here ten years ago still have acc-  have forwards to other accounts and so on. So it's  unusual  that - that they, uh -	no
30958	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
30959	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	So my original  impression  was that that was  sufficient,  that if they give us contact information and that contact information isn't  accurate	no
30960	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
30961	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Then they just come back.	no
30962	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	All my files were still here.   Yeah.	no
30963	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	that  we fulfilled our burden.	no
30964	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Same as us.	no
30965	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	So if we get to a boundary case like that then maybe I  will  call the attorney about it. But, you know, hopefully we won't need to.	no
30966	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I just -	no
30967	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	O_K.	no
30968	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I d- I just don't think we  will.	no
30969	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Alright.	no
30970	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	For all the reasons that we've discussed.	no
30971	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	So we'll - we'll see if we do or not.	no
30972	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yep. And we'll see how many people respond to that email.	no
30973	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
30974	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	So far,  two  people have. So.	no
30975	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah. I think very few people will and - and - and, you know, people - people see long emails about things that they don't think	no
30976	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	is gonna be high priority, they typically, uh, don't - don't read it, or half read it.	no
30977	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Right.	no
30978	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Cuz people are swamped. But -	no
30979	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	And actually, um, I - I -	no
30980	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	didn't anticipate this so I - that's why I didn't give this comment, and it - I - this discussion has made me think it might be  nice	no
30981	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	"to have a follow-up email within the next couple of days saying ""by the way, you know, we wanna hear back from you by X_ date"	no
30982	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	"and please -"", and then add what Liz said - ""please, uh, respond to - please indicate you received this mail."""	no
30983	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Uh, or e- well, maybe even  additionally,  uh, um,	no
30984	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	"""Even if you've decided you have no"	no
30985	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	changes you'd like to make, if you could	no
30986	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Respond to the email.  Yep.	no
30987	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	"tell us  that "". Yeah."	no
30988	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Mm-hmm. It  is  the first time through the cycle.	no
30989	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Right. That would - that would definitely work on me. You know, it makes you feel m- like,	no
30990	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	um,	no
30991	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	if you were gonna p- if you're  predicting  that you might not  answer,  you have a  chance  now to  say  that.	no
30992	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Whereas, I - I mean, I would be much more likely  myself,	no
30993	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	"given all my email, t- to respond at that  point,  saying ""you know what, I'm probably not gonna get to it"" or whatever,"	no
30994	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	And the other th-	no
30995	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	rather than just having  seen  the email, thinking I  might  get to it, and never really,	no
30996	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah. I was -	no
30997	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	uh,  pushing  myself to actually  do  it until it's too late.	no
30998	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I was thinking that it also  lets them  know  that they don't  have  to go to the  page  to   accept  this.	no
30999	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Right. R- Right. That's true.	no
31000	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Right.	no
31001	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I mean, I - I - Yeah. So that way they could -	no
31002	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	"they can  see  from that email that if they just write back and say ""I got it, no changes"","	no
31003	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	they're off the hook. They don't have to go to the web page and -	no
31004	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
31005	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I mean, the other thing I've learned from dealing with - dealing with people sending in reviews and so forth, uh, is, um,	no
31006	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah. That's true.	no
31007	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	"if you say ""you've got three months to do this review"","	no
31008	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	um, people do it, you know,	no
31009	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	"two and seven eighths months from now. If you say ""you've got three  weeks  to do this review"", they do - do it, you know, two and seven eighths  weeks  from now -  they do the review."	no
31010	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Right.	no
31011	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	And, um -	no
31012	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	So,	no
31013	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	if we make it  a  little  less time, I don't think it'll be that much -	no
31014	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Well, and also if we want it ready by the  fifteenth,  that means we better give  them   deadline of the  first,	no
31015	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	if we have any  prayer  of actually getting everyone to respond in time.	no
31016	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	There's the responding part and there's also what if,	no
31017	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	uh, I mean, I hope this doesn't happen,	no
31018	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	what if there  are  a bunch of deletions that have to get put in and changes? Then	no
31019	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Right.	no
31020	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	we actually have to deal with that if we want it to -	no
31021	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Mm-hmm. Some lead time.	no
31022	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Ugh!  Disk space, oh my god!  I hadn't  thought  about that.	no
31023	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	By the way, has - has Jeremy signed the form?	no
31024	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	O_K.	no
31025	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	That for every meeting -	no
31026	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	any meeting which has any bleeps in it we need yet another copy of.	no
31027	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Oh.	no
31028	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Just that  channel.  Oh, no. We have to do -	no
31029	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Can't you just do that  channel?	no
31030	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	No, of  course  not. You need  all  the channels.	no
31031	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah. You have to do  all  of them,	no
31032	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Oh.	no
31033	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	as  well  as all of  these.	no
31034	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Do you have to do the other  close-talking?	no
31035	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
31036	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Wow.	no
31037	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yes. Absolutely. There's a  lot  of cross-talk.	no
31038	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	You have to do all - You  could  just do it in that  time  period, though, but I guess it's a pain.	no
31039	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Well -	no
31040	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Well, but you have to copy the whole file. Right? Because we're gonna be releasing the whole file.	no
31041	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
31042	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah. You're right.	no
31043	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Well -  I - you know, I think at a certain point,  that  copy that has the deletions will become the  master  copy.	no
31044	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah. It's just I  hate  deleting any data.	no
31045	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	So I - I don't want - I  really  would rather make a copy of it, rather than	no
31046	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Are you del- are you bleeping it by  adding?	no
31047	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	bleep it out and then -	no
31048	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Overlapping.  So,	no
31049	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	it's - it's  exactly  a censor bleep.	no
31050	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	"So what I  really  think is ""bleep""  and then I want to -"	no
31051	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I- I-	no
31052	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I- I understand, but is - is it  summing  signals or do you  delete the old one and put the new one  in?	no
31053	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I delete the old one, put the new one in. There's  nothing  left of the original signal.	no
31054	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Oh, O_K. Cuz -	no
31055	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Oh. Cuz if you were  summing,  you could -	no
31056	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	No. But anyway -  Yeah.	no
31057	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah. It would be qui- quite easy to get it back again.	no
31058	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	But -	no
31059	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	And then w- I was gonna say also that the- they don't have to stay on the system, as you know, cuz - cuz the - the ones -	no
31060	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Then someday we can sell the  unedited versions.	no
31061	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
31062	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Say again?	no
31063	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Once it's been successfully bleeped, can't you rely on the - ?	no
31064	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Or  we'll tell people the frequency of the beep and then they could subtract the beep out.	no
31065	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Encrypt  it.	no
31066	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	You can  hide  it. Yeah.	no
31067	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Oh, yeah.	no
31068	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Can't you rely on the archiving to preserve the older version?	no
31069	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Right. Exactly. I see.	no
31070	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah, that's true. Yeah. Yep, that's true.	no
31071	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	It wouldn't be that hard	no
31072	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	See, this is good. I wanted to create some  side conversations in these meetings. So -	no
31073	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah. You could  encrypt  it,	no
31074	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	to hide it.	no
31075	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	O_K.	no
31076	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	You can use spread spectrum. Hide it.  Yeah, there you go.	no
31077	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	you know, with a - with a two hundred bit -  thousand bit, uh -	no
31078	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Uh-huh.	no
31079	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Here we go.	no
31080	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah. Yeah. Cuz we don't have enough asides.	no
31081	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I have an idea. You reverse the signal, so it - it lets people say what they said backwards.	no
31082	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	There you go.	no
31083	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Then you have, like, subliminal, uh, messages, like.	no
31084	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Backwards.	no
31085	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	But,	no
31086	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	ha- you've seen the - this - the speech recognition system that reversed very short segments. Did you read that paper?	no
31087	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
31088	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	It wouldn't work. The speech recognizer still works.	no
31089	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	No.	no
31090	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah. And if you do it backward then -	no
31091	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
31092	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	H_- good old H_M_M.  No, it's backward-forward.	no
31093	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	That's cuz they use forward-backward.	no
31094	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Forward but backward. That's right. Good point.	no
31095	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	A  point.	no
31096	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Uh.	no
31097	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Well, I'm sorry if I sound a little  peeved  about this whole thing. It's just we've had meeting after meeting after meeting a- on this and it seems like we've never gotten it resolved.	no
31098	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Well, but we never also - we've also never  done  it.	no
31099	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Hmm.	no
31100	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Uh.	no
31101	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	So. Yeah.	no
31102	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	If it makes -	no
31103	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	So.	no
31104	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	This is the first cycle. There're bound to be some glitches the first time through.	no
31105	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	And, uh - and I'm sorry responding without, uh, having much knowledge, but the thing is, uh, I am, like, one of these people who gets a gazillion mails and - and stuff comes in as	no
31106	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Well, and that's exactly why I did it the way I  did  it, which is the  default  is if you do  nothing  we're gonna  release  it. Because,	no
31107	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
31108	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	you know, I have my   stack  of emails of to d- to be  done,	no
31109	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	that, you know, fifty or sixty  long,  and the ones at the  top  I'm  never  gonna  get  to.	no
31110	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Right.	no
31111	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	And, uh  So - so -	no
31112	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Move  them   to the bottom.	no
31113	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	"So - so the only thing we're missing is - is some way to  respond   to easily to say, uh, ""O_K, go ahead"" or something. Yeah."	no
31114	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah, right.	no
31115	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	So, i- this  is  gonna mean -	no
31116	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Just re-mail  them   to yourself and then they're at the bottom.	no
31117	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
31118	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah. That's actually definitely a good point. The m- email doesn't  specify	no
31119	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
31120	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	that you can just reply to the email, as op- as opposed to going to the form and -	no
31121	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	In -	no
31122	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Mm-hmm.	no
31123	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Right.	no
31124	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	And it also doesn't give a - a specific - I didn't think of it.	no
31125	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	S- I think it's a good idea - an ex- explicit time by which this will be considered	no
31126	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah, release.	no
31127	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	definite.	no
31128	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	And - and it has to be a time earlier than that endpoint.	no
31129	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah. It's  converging.	no
31130	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	This - um, I've seen this recently. Uh, I got email, and it -	no
31131	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah. That's right.	no
31132	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	i- if I use a MIME-capable mail reader, it actually	no
31133	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	says, you know, click on this button to confirm receipt  of the - of the mail.	no
31134	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Hmm.	no
31135	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Oh,  that's  interesting.	no
31136	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	So -	no
31137	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	You - you can -	no
31138	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	A lot of mailers support return receipt. But it doesn't confirm that they've  read  it.	no
31139	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	It's like certified mail.	no
31140	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Could  do  that.	no
31141	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Right.	no
31142	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	No, no, no. This is  different.  This is not - So, I - I know, you can tell, you know, the, uh, mail delivery agent to - to confirm that the mail was  delivered  to your  mailbox.  But - but, no. This was different.	no
31143	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Mmm.	no
31144	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Right.	no
31145	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Ins- in the  mail,  there was a -	no
31146	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Oh, just a  button.  Oh, yeah.	no
31147	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	uh, th- there was a  button  that when you  clicked  on it, it would send,	no
31148	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	uh, you know, a actual acknowledgement to the  sender  that you had actually  looked  at the mail.	no
31149	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah. Unfor- Yeah, we could do that. But I  hate  that.	no
31150	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	But it o- but it only works for, you know, MIME-capable - you know, if you use Netscape or something like that for your n-	no
31151	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
31152	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	You might as well just  respond  to the mail. I mean	no
31153	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	And -	no
31154	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	And we actually need a  third  thing. It's not that you've  looked  at it, it's that you've looked at it and - and - and  agree  with  one  of the possible actions. Right?	no
31155	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Right.	no
31156	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	"No, no. You can  do  that. You know, you can put this button anywhere you want, and you can put it the bottom of the message and say ""here, by - you know, by clicking on this, I - I agree -"	no
31157	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Oh?	no
31158	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Oh, I see.	no
31159	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	"uh, you know, I acknowledge -"""	no
31160	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	That i- i- my first-born children are yours, and - Yeah.	no
31161	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
31162	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Quick question. Are, um -	no
31163	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Well, I could put a U_R_L in there without any difficulty and  even pretty simple MIME readers can do that. So.	no
31164	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	But why shouldn't they just  email back? I don't see there's a problem.  It's very nice. I - I like the high-tech aspect of it, but I think -	no
31165	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah. Reply.	no
31166	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
31167	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Right.	no
31168	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
31169	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	No, no, no.  I actually  don't.  I'm just saying that	no
31170	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I appreciate it.	no
31171	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Well, I - cuz I use a  text  mail reader.	no
31172	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	if ev- but I'm -	no
31173	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Don't you use V_I	no
31174	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	for your mai- ?	no
31175	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
31176	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Wow. That's - that's my guy. Alright.	no
31177	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	You - you read email  in V_I?	no
31178	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
31179	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.  I like V_I.	no
31180	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	So - I - i-	no
31181	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	"There's these logos  that you can put at the bottom of your web page, like ""powered by V_I""."	no
31182	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
31183	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Wow.	no
31184	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Anyway, quick question. How m-	no
31185	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	You could put  wed  bugs in the email.	no
31186	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I see.	no
31187	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
31188	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Like, there were  three  meetings this time, or so- or how many? Six?	no
31189	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Six.	no
31190	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	But, no- of different people. So I guess if you're in  both  these types of meetings, you'd have a lot. But -	no
31191	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	How - I mean, it  also  depends on how many -	no
31192	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Like, if we release - this time it's a fairly small number of meetings, but what if we release, like, twenty-five meetings to people?	no
31193	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Well, what my s- expectation is, is that we'll send out one of these emails  every time a meeting has been checked and is ready.	no
31194	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	In th-	no
31195	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I don't know.	no
31196	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Oh. Oh, O_K. So this time was just the first chunk. O_K.	no
31197	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	So. Tha- that was my intention. It's just - yeah - that we just  happened  to have a  bunch  all at once.	no
31198	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Well, that's a good idea.	no
31199	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I mean, maybe - Is that  the way it's gonna be, you think, Jane?	no
31200	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I agree with you.  It's - we could do it, uh - I- I could - I'd be happy with either way, batch-wise - What I was thinking - Uh, so  this  one -	no
31201	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	That was exactly right, that we had a - uh, uh -	no
31202	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I - I had wanted to get the entire set of twelve hours ready.	no
31203	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Don't have it.	no
31204	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	But, uh, this was the biggest clump I could do by a time where I thought it was reasonable. People would be able to check it and still have it ready by then.	no
31205	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Mm-hmm.	no
31206	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	My, um - I was thinking that with the  N_S_A meetings, I'd like - there are three of  them,  and they're - uh, I - I will have  them  done by Monday.	no
31207	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Uh, unfortunately the time is later and I don't know how that's gonna work out, but I thought it'd be good to have  that  released as a clump, too, because then,	no
31208	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	you know, they're - they - they have a - it- it's in a  category,  it's not quite so  distracting  to them, is what I was thinking, and it's all in one chu-	no
31209	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	But after  that,  when we're caught up a bit on this process,  then,  um, I could imagine sending them out periodically as they become available.	no
31210	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	O_K.	no
31211	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I could do it either  way.  I mean, it's a question of how distracting it is to the people who have to do the checking.	no
31212	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	We heard anything from I_B_M?	no
31213	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	at all ?	no
31214	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Uh. Let's see. We - Yeah, right. So we got the transcript back from that one meeting. Everything seemed fine.	no
31215	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Adam  had a script that will  put everything back together and there was - Well, there was one small problem but it was a simple thing to fix.	no
31216	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	And then, um,  we, uh - I sent him a pointer to three more.	no
31217	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	And so he's  off and  working on those.	no
31218	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah. Now we haven't actually had anyone go  through  that meeting, to see whether the transcript is  correct  and to see how much was  missed  and all that sort of stuff. So at some point we need to do that.	no
31219	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
31220	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	That's on my list.	no
31221	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Well, that's on my list.	no
31222	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah. It's gonna have to go through our regular	no
31223	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	"I mean, the  one  thing I noticed is it did miss a  lot  of backchannels. There are a fair number of ""yeahs"" and ""uh-huhs"" that - it's just - that aren't in there."	no
31224	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	process.	no
31225	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	So.	no
31226	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Hmm.	no
31227	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	But I think - Yeah. Like you said, I mean, that's - that's gonna be our standard proc- that's what the transcribers are gonna be spending most of their time  doing,  I would imagine, once - once we -	no
31228	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Mm-hmm.	no
31229	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.	no
31230	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yes, absolutely. Yeah.	no
31231	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	It's gonna -	no
31232	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	One question about the backchannels. Do you suppose that was because they weren't caught by the pre-segmenter?	no
31233	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yes, absolutely. Absolutely.	no
31234	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Oh, interesting.	no
31235	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Oh, interesting. O_K.	no
31236	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah. They're - they're  not  in the segmented. It's not that the  I_B_M people didn't  do  it.	no
31237	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	O_K.	no
31238	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	O_K.	no
31239	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Just they didn't get marked.	no
31240	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	O_K. So maybe when the detector for  that  gets better or something -   I w- I -	no
31241	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	There's another issue which is this - we've been, uh, contacted by University of Washington now, of course, to, um -	no
31242	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	We sent them the transcripts that correspond to those  six meetings	no
31243	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	and they're downloading the	no
31244	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	audio files. So they'll be doing that. Chuck's - Chuck's, uh,	no
31245	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	put that in.	no
31246	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Mm-hmm. Yeah, I pointed them to the set that Andreas put, uh, on the	no
31247	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	web so th- if they want to compare directly with  his  results they  can.	no
31248	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	And, um, then once, uh,	no
31249	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	th- we can also point them at the, um,	no
31250	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	uh, the original meetings	no
31251	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	and they can grab those, too, with S_C_P.	no
31252	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Wait. So you put the  reference  files - ?	no
31253	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	No, no. They d- they wanted the audio. Jane sent them the, uh, transcripts.	no
31254	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Or the - ?	no
31255	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	No, I mean of the  transcripts.	no
31256	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Um.	no
31257	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Well, we can talk about it off-line.	no
31258	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	There's another meeting in here, what, at  four?	no
31259	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Mm-hmm.	no
31260	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Right? Yeah, so we have to finish by three forty-five.	no
31261	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	D- d- So, does Washi- does - does U_W wanna u- do this - wanna use this data for  recognition  or for something else?	no
31262	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Uh, for recognition.	no
31263	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I think they're doing w- didn't they want to do language modeling on, you know, recognition-compatible transcripts  or -  ?	no
31264	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Oh.	no
31265	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Oh.	no

31285	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	And it's also a g- a good indication of the - of that. The next one. This was about, uh, Claudia and  she'd been really b- busy with stuff, such as  waivers.	no
31286	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Uh, O_K. Um, next one. Um.	no
31287	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	"This was  an interesting one. So the original was ""So that's not - so Claudia's not the  bad   master  here"",   and then he laughs, but it really ""web master""."	no
31288	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Web master.	no
31289	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Oh.  Uh-oh.	no
31290	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	And then you see another type of uncertainty which is, you know, they just didn't  know  what to make out of that.	no
31291	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yep.	no
31292	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	"So instead of ""split upon unknown"",  it's ""split in principle""."	no
31293	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Jane, these are from I_B_M? The top lines?	no
31294	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Spit upon?	no
31295	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	No, no. These are - these are  our  local transcriptions of the N_S_A meetings. The  transcribers   - transcriber's version ver- versus the  checked  version.	no
31296	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	No, these are  ours.	no
31297	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Oh.	no
31298	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Oh, I see.	no
31299	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	My -  my  checked version, after I go through it.	no
31300	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	O_K.	no
31301	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Um, then you get down here. Um.	no
31302	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Sometimes some speakers will insert foreign  language  terms. That's the next example, the  next  one.	no
31303	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	"The, uh, version  beyond  this is - So instead of saying ""or"","	no
31304	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	"especially  those  words,  "" also""   and ""oder"" and some other ones.   Those  sneak in."	no
31305	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Um, the next one -	no
31306	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Discourse markers.	no
31307	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	That's cool.	no
31308	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Discourse markers.	no
31309	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	S-	no
31310	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Sorry, what?	no
31311	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Discourse markers. Yeah. Yeah.	no
31312	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Discourse markers? Sure. Sure, sure, sure. And it's - and it makes sense cuz it's, like, below this - it's a little subliminal there.	no
31313	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
31314	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah, yeah.	no
31315	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Um. O_K, the next one,	no
31316	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	"uh,  this is a  term.  The problem with terminology. Description with th- the transcriber has ""X_ as an advance""."	no
31317	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	"But really it's ""Q_S in advance"". I mean, I - I've benefited from some of these, uh, cross-group meetings."	no
31318	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	O_K, then you got, um,	no
31319	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	"uh, instead of ""from something-or-other cards"",  it's ""for multicast""."	no
31320	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	"And instead of "" ANN  system related"", it's "" end  system related"". This was changed to an acronym initially and it should- shouldn't have been."	no
31321	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	"And then, you can see here ""G_P_S"" was misinterpreted."	no
31322	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	It's just  totally  understanda- This is - this is a lot of  jargon.	no
31323	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Um, and the  final  one,	no
31324	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	"the transcriber had th- ""in the core network   itself   or the  exit  unknown, not the  internet  unknown""."	no
31325	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	"And it - it comes through as ""in the core network itself of the  access  provider, not the internet  backbone   core "". Now this is a lot of  terminology."	no
31326	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Mmm.	no
31327	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	And they're generally  extremely  good,	no
31328	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	but, you know in this - this area it really does  pay  to, um - to double check and I'm hoping that when	no
31329	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	the  checked  versions are run through the recognizer that you'll see s- substantial improvements in performance cuz the - you know, there're a lot of these in there.	no
31330	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah. So how often - ?	no
31331	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah, but I bet - I bet they're acoustically challenging parts anyway, though.	no
31332	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Mmm.	no
31333	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	No, actually  no.  Huh-uh.	no
31334	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Oh, really? Uh, it's - Oh, so it's just jargon.	no
31335	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	It's jargon. Yeah. I mean this is - cuz, you know you don't realize in daily life how much you have top-down influences in what you're hearing.	no
31336	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Well, but -	no
31337	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	And it's jar- it's jargon coupled with a foreign accent.	no
31338	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	But - but -	no
31339	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	But we don't - I mean, our language model right now doesn't know about these words anyhow.  So,	no
31340	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	you know, un- until you actually  get a decent language model,  @@   Adam's  right.  You probably won't notice a difference.	no
31341	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
31342	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	It probably won't do any better.	no
31343	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	But it's - I mean, it's definitely good that these are fixed. I mean,  obviously.	no
31344	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Well, also from the standpoint of getting people's approval, cuz if someone sees a page full of	no
31345	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
31346	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	uh, um, barely decipherable w- you know, sentences, and then is asked to approve of it or not,  it's, uh, uh -	no
31347	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Did I say that?	no
31348	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
31349	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	"Yeah. That would be a shame if people said ""well, I don't approve it because  the - it's not what I said"".  Yeah."	no
31350	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	O_K.	no
31351	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Well, that's exactly why I put the extra option in,	no
31352	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Exactly. That's why we discussed that.	no
31353	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	"is that I was  afraid  people would say, ""let's censor that because it's  wrong "", and I don't want them to do that."	no
31354	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
31355	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
31356	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
31357	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	And then I also - the final thing I have for transcription is that I made a purchase of some other  headphones  because of the problem of low  gain  in the originals.	no
31358	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	C-	no
31359	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	And - and they  very  much appro- they mu- much prefer the new ones, and actually I -	no
31360	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I mean, I - I think that there will be fewer things to correct because of the - the choice. We'd originally chosen, uh,	no
31361	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
31362	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	very   expensive  head- headsets but, um, they're just not as good as these, um,	no
31363	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Ugh!	no
31364	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	in this - with this respect to this particular task.	no
31365	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Well, return the old ones.	no
31366	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	It's probably impedance matching problems. But -	no
31367	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I don't know exactly, but we chose them because that's what's been used here by prominent projects in transcription. So it i- we had every reason to think they would work. Sorry, what?	no
31368	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Could be.	no
31369	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Mm-hmm.	no
31370	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	So you have spare headsets?	no
31371	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	You have spare headsets?	no
31372	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	They're  just earphones. They're not headsets. They're not microphones.	no
31373	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	No, no. I mean, just earphones?	no
31374	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Right.	no
31375	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Um,	no
31376	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	because I, uh,	no
31377	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I could use one on my workstation, just to t- because sometimes I have to listen to audio files and I don't have to b- go  borrow  it from	no
31378	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	someone and -	no
31379	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	We have actua- actually I have - W- Well, the thing is, that if we have four people come to work  for a day, I was - I was hanging on to the others	no
31380	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Oh, O_K.	no
31381	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	for, eh - for spares, but I can tell you what I recommend.	no
31382	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	No, but you'd - If you - Yeah, w- we should  get  it.	no
31383	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Sure. No problem. I just -	no
31384	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	But if you need it, just  get  it. Come  on.	no
31385	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Right.	no
31386	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah. If you  need  it. Yeah.	no
31387	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
31388	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	They're - they're - they're - they're pretty inexpensive. Yeah.	no
31389	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah, I still - I still need to get a pair, too.	no
31390	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	It'd just have to be a s- a separate order - an added order.	no
31391	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah, that -	no
31392	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	We should order a cou- uh, t-	no
31393	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I'm using one of these. Yeah.	no
31394	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	two or three or four, actually. We have -	no
31395	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I think I have a pair that I brought from home, but it's f- just for music listening and it's not - Nnn. Yeah.	no
31396	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	No. Just - just - just - just buy them.	no
31397	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Sh- Just get the model number and - Where do you buy these from? Like - ?	no
31398	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Just buy them.	no
31399	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
31400	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Cambridge SoundWorks, just down the street.	no
31401	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	You just b- go and b-  Oh.	no
31402	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah. They always have them in stock.	no
31403	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
31404	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Anyway.	no
31405	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	That'd be a good idea.	no
31406	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	W- uh, could you email out the brand?	no
31407	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
31408	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Oh, sure. Yeah. O_K.	no
31409	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Cuz I think - sounds like people are interested. So.	no
31410	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
31411	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Definitely.	no
31412	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
31413	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	It's made a difference in - in how easy. Yeah.	no
31414	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I realized something I should talk about. So what's the other thing on the agenda  actually ?	yes
31415	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	It's made a difference in - in how easy. Yeah.	no
31416	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I realized something I should talk about. So what's the other thing on the agenda  actually ?	no
31417	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Uh, the only one was Don wanted to, uh, talk about	no
31418	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	disk space yet again.	no
31419	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
31420	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	u- It's short. I mean, if you wanna go, we can just throw it in at the end.	no
31421	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	No, no. Why don't you - why don't you go ahead since it's short.	no
31422	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Um, well, uh.	no
31423	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Oh, I thought you meant the disk space. Yeah, we  know  disk space is short.	no
31424	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	The disk space was short. Yeah. That's what I thought too.	no
31425	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	That's a  great  ambiguity.	no
31426	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
31427	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	It's one of these - it's - it's  social  and, uh, discourse level and -	no
31428	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	It's -	no
31429	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
31430	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I- i- i- it- i-	no
31431	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah, it's  great.  Yeah, double - double -	no
31432	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Sorry.  See, if I had that little  scratch-pad, I would have made an X_ there.	no
31433	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah, it was really goo-	no
31434	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Thank you, thank you.	no
31435	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Uh, well, we'll  give  you one then.	no
31436	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
31437	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Um.	no
31438	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	So, um, without thinking about it, when I offered up my  hard  drive last week -	no
31439	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Oh, no.	no
31440	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	It was while I was out of town.	no
31441	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Um, this is always a suspect phrase.	no
31442	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	But, um,  no.  I, uh - I realized that we're going to be doing a lot of experiments, um,	no
31443	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	o- for this, uh, paper we're writing, so we're probably gonna need a lot more - We're probably gonna need	no
31444	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	that  disk space that we  had  on that eighteen gig hard drive. But,	no
31445	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	um, we also have someone else coming in that's gonna help us out with some stuff. So -	no
31446	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	We've just ordered a hundred gigabytes.	no
31447	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I think we need, like, another eighteen gig disk  to be safe.	no
31448	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	O_K. We just need to -	no
31449	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Well, we're getting three thirty - thirty-sixes.	no
31450	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	So.	no
31451	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	O_K.	no
31452	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Right? That are going into the main f- file server. So.	no
31453	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	O_K.	no
31454	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Markham's ordering and they should be coming in soon.	no
31455	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	W- Well. So - so -	no
31456	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Soon?	no
31457	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah. I mean, I guess the thing is is, all I need is to hang it off, like,	no
31458	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	the person who's coming in, Sonali's, computer.	no
31459	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Oh, so - so, you mean the d- the internal - the disks on the machines that we just got?	no
31460	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Whew.	no
31461	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Or we can  move   them.	no
31462	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	No.	no
31463	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Or  extra  disk?	no
31464	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	These are gonna go onto Abbott.	no
31465	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Ne- new disks.	no
31466	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Onto Abbott, the file server.	no
31467	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	So are we gonna move the stuff off of my hard drive onto that when those come in? O_K. That's fine.	no
31468	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Oh, oh. O_K.	no
31469	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	On - Yeah.	no
31470	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Once they come in. Sure.	no
31471	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Uh, i-	no
31472	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Do - when - when is this planned for  roughly?	no
31473	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	They should be - I - I imagine next week or something.	no
31474	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	O_K. So -	no
31475	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	If you're - if you're  desperate,  I have some space on my drive.	no
31476	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	O_K.	no
31477	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	I think if I'm -	no
31478	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	But I - I vacillate between no space free and  a few gig free. So.	no
31479	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
31480	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah. I think I can find something if I'm desperate and, um, in the meantime I'll just hold out. That was the only thing I wanted to bring up.	no
31481	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	O_K.	no
31482	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	It should be  soon.  We - we should -	no
31483	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	O_K.	no
31484	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	So there's another hundred gig. So.	no
31485	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Alright. Great.	no
31486	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Mm-hmm.	no
31487	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	O_K.	no
31488	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	"It's  great  to be able to  do  it, just say ""oh yeah, a hundred gig, no big deal""."	no
31489	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	That's it.	no
31490	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Good.	no
31491	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
31492	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.  A hundred gig here, a hundred gig there.  It's eventually	no
31493	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Well, each  meeting  is like a  gig  or something, so it's really -	no
31494	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
31495	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	real disk space.	no
31496	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.	no
31497	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Um. Yeah. I was just going to comment that I- I'm going to, uh, be on the phone with Mari tomorrow, late afternoon. We're supposed to	no
31498	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Oh, yeah.	no
31499	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	get together and talk about, uh, where we are on things. Uh, there's this meeting coming  up,	no
31500	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	uh, and there's  also  an annual report. Now, I never actually - I - I was  asking  about this. I don't really  quite  understand this.	no
31501	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	She was re- she was referring to it as - I think this actually  didn't just come from her, but this is  what, uh, DARPA had asked for.	no
31502	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Um, she's referring to it as the an- annual report for the fiscal  year.  But of course the fiscal year starts in  October,	no
31503	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	so I don't quite understand w- w-	no
31504	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	why we do an annual report that	no
31505	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	She's either really late or really early.	no
31506	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	we're writing in July.	no
31507	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Huh.	no
31508	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Or she's getting a good early start.	no
31509	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Uh, I think basically it- it's none of those. It's that the meeting is in July so they - so DARPA just said do an annual report. So.	no
31510	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	So.	no
31511	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	So anyway, I'll be putting together stuff. I'll do it,	no
31512	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	uh, you know, as much as I can without bothering people, just by looking at - at papers and status reports. I mean, the status reports you do are very helpful.	no
31513	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Hmm.	no
31514	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Uh, so I can grab stuff there. And if, uh - if I have some questions I'll -	no
31515	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	When we remember to fill  them   out.	no
31516	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Yeah.  If   people could do it as soon as - as you can, if you haven't done one si- recently. Uh.	no
31517	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Uh, but, you know, I'm - I'm sure before  it's all done, I'll end up bugging people for - for more clarification about stuff.	no

31619	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	the new data that Don will start to process - the, um -	no
31620	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	when he can get these - You know, before we were working with	no
31621	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	these segments that were all  synchronous  and that caused a lot of problems because you have	no

31637	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	Mm-hmm.	no
31638	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	But, I mean, the good news is that that will have	no
31639	transcript	transcript_Bmr027	sort of the European experts in prosody - sort of a different crowd, and I think we're the only people working on prosody in meetings so far, so that should be interesting.	no

31778	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	to go to I_B_M.	no
31779	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	For I_B_M, yeah.	no
31780	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	O_K.	no
31781	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Hmm.	no
31782	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	and the rest are in process being transcribed uh here.	no
31783	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So we're doing some in parallel.	no
31784	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So does she have transcribers right now who are basically sitting idle because there's no data back from	no
31785	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yep.	no
31786	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	No.	no
31787	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	No, no. We haven't done that process. So. They'r- they're doing the full transcription process.	no
31788	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Oh  no no. No. We're not waiting on them.	no
31789	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I_B_M no?	no
31790	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Oh.	no
31791	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Oh, O_K.	no
31792	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
31793	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So they're just doing their own thing until -	no
31794	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Because I -	no
31795	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	We're doing it in parallel, yeah.	no
31796	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	O_K.	no
31797	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I need to ask Jane whether it's - it would be O_K for her -	no
31798	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	um, s- some of her people to	no
31799	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	transcribe uh some of the initial data we got from the SmartKom data collection, which is these short like five or seven minute sessions.	no
31800	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yep.	no
31801	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Um and we want it - You know, we need -	no
31802	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	The -  Again,  we - we have a similar uh	no
31803	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	logistic set-up where we  are  supposed to send the data to Munich and get it transcribed and get it back.	no
31804	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
31805	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	But to get  going  we would like some of the data transcribed right away so we can get  started.	no
31806	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yep, sounds familiar.	no
31807	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	And so um I wanted to ask Jane if - if	no
31808	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	uh, you know, maybe one of their	no
31809	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	transcribers could - could do - I mean since these are very  short,  that should really be uh,	no
31810	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
31811	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	um -	no
31812	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	There's only two channels.	no
31813	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So it's only - Yeah. As the synthesis doesn't have to be  transcribed  I think. So.	no
31814	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	It's - Yeah. It's only two -	no
31815	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right, s-	no
31816	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah. So - So it's basically one channel to transcribe. And it's - One session is only	no
31817	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	uh like seven -	no
31818	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So that should have ma- many fewer - And it's also not uh- a bunch of interruptions with people and all that, right? So.  Yeah.	no
31819	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right. And  some  of it is  read  speech, so we could give them the -	no
31820	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	the thing that they're reading and they just may -	no
31821	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Make sure it's right.	no
31822	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	And so um,	no
31823	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yep.	no
31824	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	um, I guess since she's - I was gonna ask her but since she's not around I - maybe I'll -	no
31825	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah, well it certainly seems -	no
31826	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Uh if - if that's O_K with you to - to, you know,	no
31827	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
31828	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	get that stuff uh - to ask her for that, then I'll do that.	no
31829	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah, if we're held up on this other stuff a  little  bit in order to encompass that, that's O_K because I- I- um, I mean I still have high hopes that the- that the I_B_M pipeline'll work out for us, so it's -	no
31830	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
31831	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	O_K, yeah.	no
31832	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
31833	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Alrighty.	no
31834	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Oh, yeah, and also related to the  transcription  stuff, so I've been trying to keep a web page uh up to date f- showing what the current status is of the trans- of all the things we've collected and what stage each meeting is in, in terms of whether it's -	no
31835	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Can you mail that out to the list?	no
31836	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm, yeah I will. I - That's the thing that I sent out just to  foo  people saying can you update these pages and so that's where I'm putting it but I'll -	no
31837	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Oh, O_K, O_K.	no
31838	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I'll send it out to the list telling people to look at it.	no
31839	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah, I haven't done that. So. I have lots of stuff to add that's just in my own directory. I'll try to get to that.	no
31840	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
31841	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	O_K. So Jane also wanted to talk about participant approval, but I don't really think there's much to talk about. I'm just gonna do it.  And uh, if anyone objects too much then they can do it instead.	yes
31842	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	O_K. So Jane also wanted to talk about participant approval, but I don't really think there's much to talk about. I'm just gonna do it.  And uh, if anyone objects too much then they can do it instead.	no
31843	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	You are going to -	no
31844	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I'm gonna send out to the participants, uh, with links to web pages which contain the transcripts and allow them to	no
31845	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	suggest edits. And then bleep them out.	no
31846	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	O_K.	no
31847	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	For the ones that we have.	no
31848	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So but it's just transcripts, not the - not the audio?	no
31849	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Um -	no
31850	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Nope, they'll have access to the audio also.	no
31851	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	O_K, yeah, yep. Ah.	no
31852	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I mean that's my intention. Because the transcripts might not be right. So you want people to be able to listen to them.	no
31853	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
31854	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So -	no
31855	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
31856	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So, um the audio that they're gonna have access to, will that be the  uncompressed  version? Or will you have scripts that like uncompress the various pieces and -	no
31857	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Oh, that's a good point.	no
31858	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	That's a good point. Yeah, it's - it's probably going to have to be the  uncompressed  versions because, uh, uh, it takes too long to do random access decompression.	no
31859	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Hmm.	no
31860	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah, I was just wondering because we're uh running out of the un-backed-up disk space on	no
31861	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Well, that was the other point.  Yep, that's another agenda item.	no
31862	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Oh, was that another one? O_K. I'll wait.	no
31863	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So, uh -	no
31864	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	But that is a good point so we'll get to that, too. Um, DARPA demo status, not much to say. The back-end stuff is working out fine. It's more or less ready to go. I've added some stuff that uh indes- indexes by the meeting type M_R, E_D_U, et cetera and also by the user I_D.	yes
31865	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	But that is a good point so we'll get to that, too. Um, DARPA demo status, not much to say. The back-end stuff is working out fine. It's more or less ready to go. I've added some stuff that uh indes- indexes by the meeting type M_R, E_D_U, et cetera and also by the user I_D.	no
31866	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So that the  front-end  can then do  filtering  based on that as well.	no
31867	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Uh -	no
31868	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	The back-end is uh, going more slowly as I s- I think I said before just cuz I'm not much of a Tcl-T_K programmer.	no
31869	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	And uh Dave Gelbart says he's a little too busy. So I think Don and I are gonna work on that and - and you and I can just talk about it off-line more.	no
31870	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
31871	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	But uh  the  back-end  was pretty smooth. So I think, we'll have something. It may not be as -	no
31872	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Oh-	no
31873	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	As pretty as we  might  like, but we'll have something.	no
31874	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I wondered whe- when we would reach Dave's saturation point. He's sort of been - been volunteering for everything and  and uh -	no
31875	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
31876	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
31877	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	O_ K.  Finally said he was too  busy.   I guess we  reached  it.	no
31878	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah, he - he actually - he volunteered but then he s- then he retracted it. So. Oh well.	no
31879	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Um -	no
31880	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	And, also um,	no
31881	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I was just showing Andreas, I got um an X_Waves	no
31882	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	kind of display, and I don't know how much more we can do with it - with like the prosodic stuff where we have like stylized pitches and signals and the transcripts on the bottom so, right now it's just an X_Waves and then you have three windows but I don't know, it looked pretty nice and I'm sure it - think it has potential for	no
31883	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Oh, cool.	no
31884	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	For a demo?  Yeah, sounds good.	no
31885	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	a little something, yeah, for a demo.	no
31886	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So -	no
31887	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	O_K, so again, the issue is - For July, the issue's gonna be what can we fit into a Windows machine, uh, and so on, but -	no
31888	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Oh.  O_K.	no
31889	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So it might just be slides.	no
31890	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah, O_K. Well, we'll see, um -	no
31891	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Well -   Yeah.	no
31892	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I've been putting together uh Transcriber things for Windows so i- And I installed it on Dave Gelbart's P_C and it worked just fine. So hopefully that will work.	no
31893	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Really? So is that -	no
31894	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Because there's some people um -	no
31895	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	It would be cool if we could uh get that to work uh at - at S_R_I because the um -	no
31896	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
31897	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yep.	no
31898	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Well	no
31899	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	we have m- m- We have more Windows machines to run the -	no
31900	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Transcriber is Tcl-T_K, very generic with Snack, so basically anything you can get Snack to run on, it will work.	no
31901	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
31902	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
31903	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
31904	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah but - But the problem is	no
31905	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	the version Transcriber works with, the Snack version, is one point six whatever and that's not anymore supported. It's not on - on the web page anymore. But I just wrote an email to - to the author of - to the Snack author and he sent me to one point six whatever library and so it works.	no
31906	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Well I thought it was packaged with  Transcriber?	no
31907	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah, but then you can't add our patches and then	no
31908	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Oh.	no
31909	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	the - the new version is - is totally different a- and in - yeah, in terms of - of the source code. You - you can't find the Tcl files anymore. It's some whatever wrapped thing and you can't - you can't access that so	no
31910	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Ah.	no
31911	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mmm.	no
31912	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	you have to install - First install Tcl then install Snack and then install the Transcriber thing and  then	no
31913	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	do the patches. Yeah.	no
31914	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Patch. Ugh!	no
31915	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I - I wonder if - if we should	no
31916	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	contribute our changes back to the authors so that they maintain those changes along - We have? Oh.	no
31917	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
31918	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	We have -  Yeah b- it's just hasn't made it into the release yet.	no
31919	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Oh, O_K.	no
31920	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So did you um	no
31921	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	put the uh -  the N_T version out on the uh Meeting Recorder page? Or -	no
31922	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	No, I haven't done that yet. I'm -  oh  Nope.	no
31923	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	But I definitely will do that.	no
31924	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So, can some of the stuff that Don's talking about somehow fit into this	no
31925	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Uh, mean you just have a set of numbers that are associated with the -	no
31926	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
31927	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah, it's basically ASCII files or binary files, whatever representation. Just three different - It's a waveform and	no
31928	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So -	no
31929	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	just a stylized pitch vector basically so it's -	no
31930	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So - So - Well -	no
31931	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I mean we could do it in Matl-  I mean you could do it in a number of different places I'm sure.	no
31932	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	But - But it would be cool if the Transcriber interface had like another window for the - you know, maybe above the waveform where it would show some arbitrary	no
31933	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yep.	no
31934	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
31935	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	valued function that is - that is you know time synchron- ti-	no
31936	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah, that'd be very cool.	no
31937	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yes.	no
31938	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	It'd be easy enough to add that. Again it's - it's  It's more Tcl-T_ K  programming. So someone who's familiar with Tcl-T_K has to do it, but uh, it wouldn't be hard to do.	no
31939	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	ti- time synchronous with the waveform.	no
31940	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
31941	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
31942	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
31943	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	But it would almost be like having another waveform displayed. S- Right.	no
31944	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
31945	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yep.	no
31946	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yep.	no
31947	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.  Yeah, maybe we could l- look into that.	no
31948	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
31949	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	But it - it seems to me that	no
31950	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	And -	no
31951	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I c-	no
31952	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	It doesn't seem like having that real time is that necessary. So yo- It seems to me you could do images.	no
31953	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Um  What do you mean by real time? Do you mean like -	no
31954	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Like being able to scroll through it and stuff for the demo.	no
31955	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	O_K.	no
31956	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Is that what you mean? Yeah.	no
31957	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah, jus-  Yeah.  It just seems to me jus-	no
31958	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	It would be cool to see it - It would be cool like to see -	no
31959	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	to hear it and see it, and see the pitch contours also.	no
31960	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	And to  hear  it. Yeah. Yeah.	no
31961	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
31962	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Sure, but I don't think - I - You can do all that just statically in PowerPoint.	no
31963	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I think it would lose -	no
31964	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah, I mean y-	no
31965	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Just record the audio clip and show an image and I think that's -	no
31966	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right, right.	no
31967	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I just thought if you meant slides I thought you meant like just	no
31968	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	like	no
31969	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	um  view  graphs or something.	no
31970	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	You know, wh- Yeah. So. Uh, no, we're talking about on the computer and - and um, I think when we were talking about this before we had littl- this little demo meeting, we sort of set up a range of different degrees of liveness that you could have	no
31971	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
31972	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	and,  the more live, the better, but uh, given the crunch of time, we may have to retreat from it to some extent. So I think -	no
31973	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	For a  lot  of reasons, I think it would be very nice to have this Transcriber interface be able to show some other interesting signal along with it so it'd be a good thing to get in there. But,	no
31974	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
31975	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	um -  Anyway,  jus- just looking for ways that we could actually show what you're doing, uh,	no
31976	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
31977	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	in -  to people.	no
31978	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Cuz a lot of this stuff,  particularly  for Communicator, uh certainly a significant chunk of the things that we waved our arms about th- originally had t- had to do with prosodics	no
31979	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	It'd  be nice to show that we can actually get them and	no
31980	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
31981	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mmm.	no
31982	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	see them.	no
31983	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	And the last i- item on the agenda is disk issues yet again. So, we're doing O_K on backed up. We're - We're only about thirty percent on the second disk.	yes
31984	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	And the last i- item on the agenda is disk issues yet again. So, we're doing O_K on backed up. We're - We're only about thirty percent on the second disk.	no
31985	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So, uh,	no
31986	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	we have a  little  bit of time before that becomes critical, but we are like ninety five percent, ninety eight percent on the scratch disks for the expanded meetings.	no
31987	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
31988	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	And, my original intention was like we would just delete them as we needed more space, but unfortunately we're in the position where we have to deal with all the meeting data	no
31989	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	all at once, in a lot of different ways.	no
31990	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
31991	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Oh there's a lot of  transcribers,  too.	no
31992	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah, there're a lot of transcribers, so all of those need to be expanded, and then people are doing chunking and I want to do uh, uh,	no
31993	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
31994	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
31995	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	An-	no
31996	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
31997	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	uh, the permission forms, so I want those to be live, so there's a lot of data that has to be around.	no
31998	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Um -	no
31999	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	And Jane was gonna talk to, uh, Dave Johnson about it. One of the things I was thinking is we - we just got these hundred - alright, excuse me - ten, uh	no
32000	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	SPARC-Blade	no
32001	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Did they come in?	no
32002	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	SUN-Blades. They came in but they're not set up yet. And so it seems to me we could hang scratch disk on those	no
32003	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	SUN-Blades. Yeah. They came in the other day.	no
32004	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
32005	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Oh.	no
32006	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	because they'll be in the machine room, they'll be on the fast connection to the rest of the machines.	no
32007	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	And if we just need un-backed-up space, we could just hang disks off them.	no
32008	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Well, is there - Why not just hang  them   off of Abbott, is there a -	no
32009	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
32010	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Because there's no more room in the  disk  racks on Abbott.	no
32011	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Ah.	no
32012	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Ah, I see.	no
32013	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Weren't we gonna get - Well, maybe it should get another rack.	no
32014	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	But you  still  need to  store  the  disks  somehow.	no
32015	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Well, but the SUN-Blades have spare drive bays.	no
32016	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So -	no
32017	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Just put them in.	no
32018	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	You can put two -	no
32019	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Oh you mean you put them inside the pizza boxes for the -	no
32020	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Internal. Yeah.	no
32021	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Sure.	no
32022	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
32023	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Oh.	no
32024	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Cuz the SUN - uh, these SUN-Blades take commodity hard drives. So you can just go out and buy a P_C hard drive and stick it in.	no
32025	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mmm.	no
32026	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	But if Abbott is going to be our disk server it - it -  file  server  it seems like we would want to get it, uh, a second disk rack or something.	no
32027	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Plus we're talking about buying a second dis- uh,  file  server.	no
32028	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Well, I mean there are  lots  of long term solutions. What I'm looking for is where do we s- expand the next meeting?	no
32029	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yep.	no
32030	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I see    Oh,  I  see.	no
32031	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Well, for the next meeting you might be out of luck with those  ten,  mightn't you? Uh, you know Dave Johnson is gone for, like, ten days,	no
32032	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Oh, I didn't know he had left already.	no
32033	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Uh, well, tonight.	no
32034	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Oh, oh well.	no
32035	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	You mean he won't set up the - mmm.	no
32036	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	How much space do you need for these?	no
32037	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I don't know. I don't know what his schedule is. I'm just saying he's gone.	no
32038	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	You - we need about a gig per meeting.	no
32039	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I - I thi-	no
32040	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yep.	no
32041	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I have um - I have an eighteen gig drive hanging off of my computer.	no
32042	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Alright! What's your computer's name?	no
32043	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So -	no
32044	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	You  had  an eighteen gigabyte drive.	no
32045	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Uh, Samosa.	no
32046	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah, I  had.  Well it's about - I think there's about twelve gig left.	no
32047	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So it - And you have an X_ drives installed? O_K.	no
32048	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
32049	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So, I didn't realize it was so critical. I mean I'm not doing anything on it right now until I get new meetings to transcri- or that are - new transcriptions coming in I really can't do anything.	no
32050	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	And you're o- you're offering?	no
32051	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	O_K.	no
32052	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I - I jus- I just gave Thilo some - about ten gigs, the last ten gigs of space that there was on - on uh Abbott.	no
32053	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Um not that I can't do anything, I jus-	no
32054	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Uh -	no
32055	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	And uh - So but that - But -	no
32056	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Which one was that, X_  G_? O_K.	no
32057	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	X_G.	no
32058	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	X_G.	no
32059	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
32060	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	X_G?	no
32061	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	That's also where we store the -	no
32062	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	The uh Hub-five training set waveforms, right?	no
32063	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Oops.	no
32064	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	No. I don't think that's on X_G. On X_G is only Carmen and Du- and Stephane's disk.	no
32065	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	But that won't be getting any bigger, will it?	no
32066	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
32067	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	It's - Yeah.	no
32068	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	But I've also been storing - I've been storing the  feature  files there and I guess I can s- start deleting some because we now know what the best features are and we won't be using the old ones anymore.	no
32069	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Well -	no
32070	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah, I do- I don't think it was on X_G. I th-	no
32071	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I have a lot of space, though.	no
32072	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Uh -	no
32073	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Isn't that X_H?	no
32074	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I have a lot of space and it's not - it's n- There's very little uh - Yeah not for long. But I mean it's not going f- It's not being used often at all.	no
32075	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Not - not for long.	no
32076	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Oh that's X_A - Oh that's X_ -	no
32077	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Maybe I'm confu- Oh no I'm sorry.	no
32078	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	But I'm using X_H - H_, too. So.	no
32079	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah, it's probably - Probably only about four gig is on X_ - on your X_ drive, but we'll definitely take it up if you -	no
32080	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Oh O_K.	no
32081	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I th-	no
32082	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I think you're right. It's  X_H  and D_ - The b- I'm also using  D_G  I got that confused. O_K.	no
32083	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I think it's about four or five gig cuz I have  four   meetings on there, three or four meetings.	no
32084	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Great.	no
32085	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So.	no
32086	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	We need -	no
32087	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	O_K, so that will get us through the next couple days.	no
32088	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	We need another gigaquad.	no
32089	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yep.  At least.	no
32090	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	O_K.	no
32091	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	There should - I d- There should just be a b- I should have a button.	no
32092	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	"Just press - Press each meeting saying ""we need more disk space""  ""this week"". Skip the rest of the conversation."	no
32093	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	"The ""more disk space"" button?  Yep."	no
32094	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Well we've collected so far something like	no
32095	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	uh sixty-five meetings.	no
32096	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	And - And how much does each meeting take?	no
32097	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	And it's	no
32098	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	about a gig uncompressed.	no
32099	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	It's - It's a little bit more as I usually don't - do not uncompress the - all of the P_Z_M and the P_D_A things. So.	no
32100	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Is a little more?	no
32101	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right, yeah so if you uncompressed  everything  it's even  more.  U- Uh  compressed  how much are they? Like -	no
32102	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	It's -	no
32103	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
32104	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	One point five or something.	no
32105	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Half a gig.  For all of them.	no
32106	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	About half?	no
32107	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
32108	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah. Yep.	no
32109	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So we're definitely are storing	no
32110	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	you know, all of those.	no
32111	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So there's what thirty some gig	no
32112	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So- so- So maybe there's a hundred  gig or something. Or -	no
32113	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	of just meetings so far?	no
32114	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
32115	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I mean. Cuz we - we have the uncompressed around also. So it's like -	no
32116	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right. Right. Well we - We haven't uncompressed all the meetings, but -	no
32117	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
32118	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I would  like  to.	no
32119	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah. Well I mean it's - the- they really are cheap. I mean it's just a question of figuring out  where  they should  be  and  hanging  them, but	no
32120	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
32121	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yep.	no
32122	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	But uh, we could - You know, if you want to get four disks, get four disks. I mean it's - it's small - I mean these things ar- are just a few hundred dollars.	no
32123	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah. Well I sent that message out to, I guess, you and Dave asking for - if we could get some disk. I s- I sent this out	no
32124	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
32125	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	And put it  where?	no
32126	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
32127	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	a - a day ago but - and Dave didn't respond so I don- I don't know	no
32128	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	how the whole process  works.  I mean does he just go out and  get  them and - if it's O_K, and -	no
32129	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yep.	no
32130	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So I was  assuming  he was gonna take over  that. But he's probably too busy given that he's leaving.	no
32131	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	"Yeah, I think you need a direct conversation with him. And just  say an-e- just ask him that, you know, wha- what should you do. And in my answer back was ""are you sure you just want one?"" So I mean I think"	no
32132	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
32133	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	"that what you want to do is plan ahead a little bit and figure ""well, here's what we pi- figure on doing for the next few months""."	no
32134	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Wa- a- I  know  what  they  want. The  sysadmins  would prefer to have  one  external drive per  machine.	no
32135	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So they don't want to stack up external drives.	no
32136	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
32137	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Um -	no
32138	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	And then they want everything else in the  machine  room.	no
32139	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
32140	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So the question is where are you gonna  hang  them?	no
32141	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
32142	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I don't know what the  space  situation is in the  machine  room.	no
32143	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
32144	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So.	no
32145	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right. So this is a question that's pretty hard to solve without talking to Dave, cuz it -	no
32146	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Th- The -	no
32147	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I think part of the reason why Dave can't get the - the  new  machines up is because he doesn't have room in the  machine  room right now. So he has to re- arrange  a bunch of stuff.	no
32148	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	One -	no
32149	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mmm.	no
32150	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yep.	no
32151	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	One - One	no
32152	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	On- One thing to in- to um t- to do when you need to conserve space is	no
32153	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I bet there are still some old, uh, like, nine gig disks, uh,	no
32154	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	around and you can probably consolidate them onto larger disks and - and you know recover the space.	no
32155	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yep.	no
32156	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah. No. I think Dave - Dave knows all these things, of course. An- and so, he always has a- a lot of plans of things that he's gonna do to make things better in many ways an- and runs out of time.	no
32157	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
32158	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
32159	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	But I - I know that   generally  their first priority has been for backed up disk. And so I think what he's been concentrating on is uh	no
32160	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mmm.	no
32161	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	the back - the	no
32162	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	back up system, rather than on new disk. So.	no
32163	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mmm.	no
32164	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Well. So. But this - this is a very specific question for me. Basically, we can easily get	no
32165	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Which -	no
32166	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	one to four disks, I mean you just go out and get four and we've got the money for it, it's no big deal.	no
32167	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Uh, but the question is where they go, and I don't think we can solve that here, you just have to ask him.	no
32168	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Maybe we can put some disks in the - in that back room there.	no
32169	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah really.	no
32170	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Attach to -	no
32171	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Popcorn.	no
32172	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	To the machine that collects the  data.  So then you could, at least  temporarily,  store stuff  there.  The only -	no
32173	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah?	no
32174	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Hmm.	no
32175	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah, it's just - It's not on the net, so it's a little  awkward  It's not -	no
32176	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	What do you mean it's not on the net?	no
32177	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	It's not bad.	no
32178	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	It's behind lots of fire walls that don't allow any services through except S_S_H Yep.	no
32179	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Oh because it's - because it's an ACIRI machine? Oh, oh oh.	no
32180	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
32181	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	And  also  on the list is to get it into the normal ICSI net, but	no
32182	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Who  knows  when that will happen?	no
32183	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	That  might  be a good	no
32184	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	But  that  can't be that hard. I mean -	no
32185	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	short  term solution, though.	no
32186	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	No, the - the  problem  with that apparently is that they don't currently have a  wire	no
32187	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	running to that back room  that goes anywhere near one of the  ICSI  routers.	no
32188	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Oh,    hhh.	no
32189	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So, they actually have to run a wire	no
32190	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	somewhere.	no
32191	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	@@	no
32192	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
32193	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah, e- again, you know, any one of these things is certainly not a big deal. If there was a person dedicated to doing it they would happen pretty easily but it's - it's - jus- every- ever- everybody - everybody has a - has -	no
32194	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	But Dave has to do all of them.	no
32195	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Well all of us have long lists of different things we're doing.	no
32196	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	But at any rate I think that there's a - there's a  longer  term thing and there's  immediate  need and I think we need a - a conversation with -	no
32197	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	"Uh, maybe - maybe after - after tea or something you and I can go down and - and talk to him about it  Just say ""wha- you know, what should we do right now?"""	no
32198	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	How long is David gonna be gone?	no
32199	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Uh, eleven days or something?	no
32200	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Oh my!	no
32201	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah basically tomorrow and all of  the week after.	no
32202	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	And that's all I have.	no
32203	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Um -	yes
32204	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Um -	no
32205	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Let's see. The only oth- thing - other thing I was gonna add was that um -	no
32206	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	uh, I talked briefly to Mari and uh we	no
32207	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	had  both been busy with other things so we haven't really connected that much since the  last meeting we had here	no
32208	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	but we agreed that we would have a telephone meeting	no
32209	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	the Friday after next.	no
32210	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	And I - I - I wanted to make it, um	no
32211	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	after the next one of  these  meetings, so something that we wanna	no
32212	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	do next meeting is - is uh to	no
32213	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	put together um, a kind of reasonable list for ourselves of what is it,	no
32214	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	um,	no
32215	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	that	no
32216	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	we've done.	no
32217	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I mean just sort of	no
32218	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	bulletize I mean o- e- do- do- I can - I can dream up text but  this is basically gonna lead to the annual report.	no
32219	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So  Um - If w-	no
32220	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
32221	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	This is the fifteenth?	no
32222	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Um, that would	no
32223	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So just a week from tomorrow?  O_K.	no
32224	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
32225	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
32226	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So, uh, we can - This - So that's an -	no
32227	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Is this gotta be in the morning?	no
32228	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Um -	no
32229	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Or - Because you know I - Fridays I have to leave uh	no
32230	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	like around uh two.	no
32231	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So if it could be before that would be be-	no
32232	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	No, no but I - I - I don't need other folks for the meeting. I can do it. A- A- All I'm saying is that  on  -	no
32233	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Oh, O_K, alright. Oh I'm sorry, I misunderstood. I thought you are -	no
32234	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah so what I meant was on the me-  this  meeting	no
32235	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	O_K.	no
32236	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	if I wa- something I - I - I'm making a major thing in the agenda is I wanna help in getting together a list of what it is that we've done so I can tell her.	no
32237	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Alright.	no
32238	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
32239	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I think I have a pretty good idea but - but um -	no
32240	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	O_K.	no
32241	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Uh, and then the next day uh, late in the day I'll	no
32242	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	be having that - that discussion with her.	no
32243	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mmm.	no
32244	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Um.	no
32245	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So.	no
32246	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Um - Uh - One thing - I mean - we -	no
32247	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	in past meetings we had um	no
32248	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	also a-  you know  various - variously talked about the um work that	no
32249	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	w- uh was happening sort of on the - on the recognition side um but isn't necessarily	no
32250	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
32251	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	related to  meetings  uh specifically. So. Um. And	no
32252	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I wondered whether we should	no
32253	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	maybe have um a  separate  meeting and between	no
32254	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	you know, whoever's interested in that	no
32255	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	because I feel that uh  there's  plenty of stuff to talk about but it would be sort of	no
32256	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	um	no
32257	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	maybe the  wrong  place to do it in  this  meeting if uh -	no
32258	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Think so?	no
32259	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Well, it's that -	no
32260	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	It's just	no
32261	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	gonna be ver- very  boring  for people who are not	no
32262	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	you know, sort of	no
32263	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	really  interested  in the  details  of the	no
32264	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	recognition  system.	no
32265	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I'm interested.	no
32266	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Me too.	no
32267	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Well, O_K, so how many - how many people here would  not  be interested in uh - in a meeting about recognition?	no
32268	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	w-	no
32269	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Jane  may not be.	no
32270	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Jane,  I think.	no
32271	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Well I know - Well, Jane an-	no
32272	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yep.	no
32273	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Well you mean in a  separate  meeting or ha- ha- talking about it in this -	no
32274	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	No. If we talked about it in  this  meeting.	no
32275	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	He's  wondering  how much  overlap  there will be.	no
32276	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah, so you're su- So.	no
32277	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	O_K.	no
32278	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So, uh,	no
32279	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	uh,  Liz  and  Jane  probably.	no
32280	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	O_K, so we're gonna have a  guy's  meeting.	no
32281	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Uh.	no
32282	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Good thing Liz isn't here.	no
32283	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Real -	no
32284	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Uh, if you wanna put it  that  way.	no
32285	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Watch a ball game?	no
32286	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Wh-	no
32287	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Don't  listen to this, Liz.	no
32288	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah, real - real - real men	no
32289	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	"""Real men do decoding"" or something like that."	no
32290	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
32291	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Uh.	no
32292	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I mean it- it's sort of -	no
32293	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
32294	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I mean when - when the talk is about data collection	no
32295	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	stuff, sometimes  I've  -	no
32296	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	The - Nod off?	no
32297	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	you know, I -  I'm  bored. So it's I c- I can sympathize with them not wanting to -	no
32298	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	It's cuz  y- you have a -	no
32299	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	i- to - to be uh - you know - If - I cou- you know - this could -	no
32300	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So you need a better developed  feminine  side.	no
32301	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I'm not sure I wanna -	no
32302	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	"There's probably gonna be a lot of ""bleeps"" in this meeting."	no
32303	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah, I would as-  I would guess.	no
32304	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Uh.	no
32305	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah  and -	no
32306	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Um.	no
32307	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I think it  must  be  uh nearing the end of the week.	no
32308	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Um.	no
32309	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
32310	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I -	no
32311	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	You know, I - I've heard some comments about like this. That m-  could  be. I mean the - Um.	no
32312	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
32313	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	And we don't have to do it every week. We could do it every  other  week or so. You know, whatev- or whenever we feel like we -	no
32314	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Could we -	no
32315	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right, I was -	no
32316	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Why don't we alternate this meeting every other  week?	no
32317	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Or just alternate the focus.	no
32318	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	U-	no
32319	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Tha-  That's  what I mean.	no
32320	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah, so on even weeks have  basic  on data.	no
32321	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
32322	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	We could do that, yeah.	no
32323	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
32324	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I - I -  Personally  I'd - I'm  not  in favor of more  meetings.	no
32325	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Um.	no
32326	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
32327	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Because, uh.  You know.	no
32328	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I  am.	no
32329	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Oh sor-	no
32330	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	But I do- I don't - I mean a lot of times lately it seems like we don't really have enough for a full meeting on  Meeting  Recorder. So if we did that -	no
32331	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
32332	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Well, except that we keep going for our full time.	no
32333	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yep.	no
32334	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Well, cuz we get into these other  topics.	no
32335	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
32336	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	We feel - We feel obligated to collect more data.	no
32337	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
32338	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
32339	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Ugh.	no
32340	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So if we could  alternate  the focus of the  meeting  -	no
32341	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I don't. Let's read digits and go.	no
32342	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Why don't we just  start  with that. And then if we find, you know we're just not getting enough done, there's all these topics not coming up, then we can expand into another meeting. But I - I think that's a great idea.	no
32343	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	ummh.	no
32344	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	ummh.  O_K.	no
32345	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
32346	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Uh.	no
32347	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So uh.	no
32348	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Um.	no
32349	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Let's chat about it with Liz and Jane  when we get a chance, see what they think and -	no
32350	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
32351	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah that would be good. I mean Andreas and I have	no
32352	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	various talks in the halls and there's lots of	no
32353	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
32354	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	things, you know, details and stuff that would I think people'd be interested in and I'd - you know, where do we go from here kind of things and -	no
32355	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So, it would be good.	no
32356	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah, and you're - you're attending	no
32357	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	the uh - the front-end meeting as well as the others so you have - you have	no
32358	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	probably one of the best -  you and I, I guess are the main ones who sort of see the bridge between the two. We  are  doing recognition in both of them. So.	no
32359	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Bridge.	no
32360	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
32361	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
32362	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
32363	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Uh.	no
32364	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So um.	no
32365	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	O_K?	no
32366	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So - so we could talk a  little  bit about that  now  if - if there's some time.	no
32367	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	No, no that would be for  next  week.	no
32368	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Um I jus- So the  latest  result was that um	no
32369	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	um	no
32370	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	yot	no
32371	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I tested the uh - the	no
32372	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	sort of final version of the P_L_P	no
32373	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	configuration	no
32374	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	um on development test data for - for this year's Hub-five test set.	no
32375	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
32376	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	And the	no
32377	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	recognition performance was	no
32378	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	exactly,  and I mean  exactly  up to the - you know, the first decimal, same as with the	no
32379	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	uh Mel Cepstra	no
32380	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	front-end.	no
32381	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mmm.	no
32382	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	For both females and males?	no
32383	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yes.	no
32384	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Oh!	no
32385	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Uh, well i- there was a little bit of a -	no
32386	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	i-  overall.	no
32387	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	They - They were - The  males  I think were slightly better and the  females  were slightly worse but nothing really. I mean definitely not significant.	no
32388	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
32389	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
32390	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
32391	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	And then the really nice thing was that if - if we combine the two systems we get a one and a half percent  improvement.	no
32392	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Wow.	no
32393	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So.	no
32394	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Just with ROVER?	no
32395	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	t- With N_best ROVER, which is like our  new and  improved  version of ROVER.	no
32396	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
32397	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Which u- actually uses the whole N_best list from both systems  to  mmm, uh  c- combine that.	no
32398	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So except - I mean the only key difference between the two really is the kind of smoothing at the end which is the	no
32399	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	auto-regressive versus the	no
32400	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
32401	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	cepstral truncation.  O_K.	no
32402	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	And, the -	no
32403	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	But a percent and a half? That's -	no
32404	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah, it's pretty  impressive.	no
32405	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	And - And so uh after I told the - my uh colleagues at S_R_I about that, you know,	no
32406	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	now they definitely want to, you know, uh, have a - Next time we have an evaluation they want to do uh, you know, basically a- at least the system combination.	no
32407	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Um, and, you know, why not? Uh.  So.	no
32408	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Sure, why not?	no
32409	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	We clearly gotta add a few more features, though.	no
32410	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Uh w- what do you mean? More features in the sense of front-end features or in the sense of just bells and whistles?	no
32411	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	No, uh front-end features.	no
32412	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	You know we did P_L_P and Mel Cepstra. Let's, you know, try RASTA and M_S_G, and -	no
32413	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Oh I mean - Yeah. Well  Right. So, we cou- Yeah. That's - the - the	no
32414	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	the - There's  one  thing uh - I mean you don't want to overdo it because y- every  front-end  - You know, if you - you know you basically multiply your effort by N_, where N_ is a number of different	no
32415	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Oh.	no
32416	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	systems and - Um. So.	no
32417	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
32418	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So one - one	no
32419	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	compromise would be to -	no
32420	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	only	no
32421	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	to have the - everything up to the point where you generate lattices be basically one system and then	no
32422	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	after that you rescore your lattices with the multiple systems and combine the results and that's a fairly painless um thing. So.	no
32423	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mmm.	no
32424	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	An-	no
32425	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Do you think we'd still get the one and a half uh -	no
32426	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I - I think so. Yeah. Maybe a little less because at that point the error rates are lower and so if - You know, maybe it's only  one  percent or something but that would  still  be worthwhile doing.	no
32427	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
32428	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So.	no
32429	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Um  Jus- You know, just wanted to let you know that that's working out very nicely.	no
32430	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Cool.	no
32431	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	And then we had some results on  digits, uh,	no
32432	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	with um - We - We - So this was uh	no
32433	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	really    - really sort of just to get Dave going with his um	no
32434	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	experiments. And so,	no
32435	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
32436	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	uh. But as a  result,  um, you know, we were sort of wondering why is the	no
32437	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Hub-five system doing so well on the  digits.  And the reason is basically there's a whole bunch of read  speech  data in the Hub- five  training set. And you c-	no
32438	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
32439	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
32440	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Including digits I gather, yeah.	no
32441	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	And - Not all of - No it's actually, digits is only a maybe a fifth of it. The rest is - is read - is read TIMIT data and uh ATIS data and Wall Street Journal and stuff like that.	no
32442	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	A fifth of it is how much?	no
32443	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right. But a fi- a fifth is how much?	no
32444	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	A fifth would be maybe	no
32445	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	uh two hours something.	no
32446	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah, so I mean that's actually not that different from the  amount of training that there was. So.	no
32447	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
32448	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	But it definitely helps to have the  other  read data in there  because we're doing -	no
32449	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Oh yeah  w-	no
32450	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	You know the error rate is  half  of what you do if you train only on ti- uh  TIMIT  -  uh not TIMIT uh T_I- digits,  which is only what two hours something?	no
32451	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
32452	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
32453	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I don't know.	no
32454	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So.	no
32455	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Uh, more read speech data definitely  helps.  And you can leave out all the  conversational  data with no performance penalty. That's e- That was e- Right, right.	no
32456	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah  that  was the interesting thing. Because - because uh, it was  apparent  if you put in a bunch more data it would be better, but - but uh.	no
32457	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
32458	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Well is there even  more   read   speech  data around?	no
32459	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Oh, yeah. So we only - for the Hub-five training, we're only using uh a fairly small subset of the  Macrophone   database.	no
32460	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
32461	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Um, so, you could beef that up and probably do even  better.	no
32462	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I could also put in  uh	no
32463	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
32464	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	focus condition zero from Hub-four	no
32465	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	from Broadcast News,	no
32466	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	which is mostly prepared speech.	no
32467	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	It's not exactly  read  speech but it's pretty darn close.	no
32468	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
32469	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
32470	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
32471	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Well, I mean that's  plenty  of read  speech  data. I mean, Wall Street Journal,  uh, take one example.	no
32472	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
32473	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	That's right.	no
32474	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	But um.	no
32475	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So, you know that might be useful for the people who train the - the digit recognizers to - to use uh something other than T_I-digits.	no
32476	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
32477	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Well they been using TIMIT.	no
32478	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	O_K.	no
32479	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	That - Uh.	no
32480	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	They - they uh - they experimented for a while with a bunch of different databases with French and Spanish and so forth cuz they're multilingual tests and - and uh,	no
32481	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
32482	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	um, - and actually the  best  results they got wa- were uh using TIMIT.	no
32483	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Hmm.	no
32484	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Uh -	no
32485	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	But uh - which - So that's what they're - they're using now. But - but yeah certainly if we,	no
32486	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mmm.	no
32487	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	um -	no
32488	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	If we knew what the  structure  of what we're doing there  was.  I mean there's still a bunch of messing around with different kinds of uh noise robustness algorithms. So we don't know exactly which combination we're gonna be going with.	no
32489	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
32490	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
32491	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Once we  know,  then - the  trainable  parts of it - it'd be great to run	no
32492	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	lots of - lots of stuff through.	no
32493	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	yes
32494	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	lots of - lots of stuff through.	no
32495	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
32496	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
32497	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Well, that was that. And then I th- guess Chuck and I had some discussions about how to proceed with the tandem	no
32498	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	uh system and -	no
32499	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	You wanna -  You wanna see where that  stands ?  @@	no
32500	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Well, I'm - Yeah, so Andreas uh brought over the uh alignments that the S_R_I system uses. And so I'm in the process of um	no
32501	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	converting those alignments into uh label files that we can use to train	no
32502	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	uh a new net with. And uh so then I'll train the net. And.	no
32503	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	An- And one side effect of that would be that it's - um that the phone set would change. So the M_L_P would be trained on I think only forty-six or forty-eight - forty-eight phones?	no
32504	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
32505	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Eight.	no
32506	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
32507	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Uh which is smaller than the um	no
32508	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	than the phone set that - that we've been using so far.	no
32509	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
32510	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	And that - that -  that  will probably  help,  actually, because	no
32511	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So it's a little different?	no
32512	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	um the fewer dimensions uh e- the less trouble probably with the - as far as just the um,	no
32513	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	um -	no
32514	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Just - You know we want to try things like  deltas  on the  tandem  features. And so you h- have to multiply everything by two or three. And so, you know,	no
32515	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	fewer dimensions in the  phone set would be actually helpful just from a logistics point of view.	no
32516	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Sure. Although we - I mean, it's not  that  many fewer and - and - and we take a K_L_T anyway so we could - Yeah.	no
32517	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
32518	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Exactly. So - so that was the  other  thing. And then we wanted to s- just limit it to maybe	no
32519	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	uh something on the same order of dimensions as we use in a standard um	no
32520	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	front-end.  So	no
32521	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	that would mean  just  doing the top I don't know ten or twelve or something of the K_L_T	no
32522	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah, and I think - and we sh- again check - we should check with Stephane. My impression was that when we did that before that had very little - uh he didn't lose very much.	no
32523	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	dimensions.	no
32524	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
32525	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	By just taking the top whatever?	no
32526	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yep.	no
32527	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah  yeah.	no
32528	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	But then - And then  something  - Once we  have  the new M_L_ P  trained up,	no
32529	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	uh one thing I wanted to try just for the fun of it was to actually run uh like a standard hybrid system that is based on	no
32530	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	you know, those features uh and uh retrain M_L_P and also the	no
32531	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	you know, the  dictionary  that we use for the Hub- five  system.	no
32532	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	And the b- And the base u- starting off with the base of the alignments that you got from i- from a pretty decent system.	no
32533	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Exactly.	no
32534	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
32535	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah. So	no
32536	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
32537	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	that would basically give us a, um, more -  hopefully  a - a	no
32538	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	better  system	no
32539	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	um because - you know, compared to what Eric did a while ago, where he trained up, I think, a system based on Broadcast News and then	no
32540	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	uh tra- retraining it on  Switchboard  or s- uh and -	no
32541	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
32542	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	But he - I think he d- he didn't -	no
32543	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	he probably didn't use  all  the training data	no
32544	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	that was available. And his dictionary probably wasn't as tuned to um	no
32545	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	conversational speech as - as the -	no
32546	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	as  ours  is. So.	no
32547	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	That's - That's certainly  one  thing, yeah. Uh.	no
32548	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	And the  dictionary  made a huge difference. Uh. We - we made some	no
32549	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
32550	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	improvements to the dictionary's uh - to the dictionary about two years ago which resulted in a -	no
32551	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	uh something like a four percent absolute	no
32552	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	error rate reduction on Switchboard, which -	no
32553	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Well the  other  thing is, dipping	no
32554	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	deep into history and into uh our resource management days,	no
32555	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
32556	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	when we were collaborating with S_R_I  before,  uh	no
32557	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mmm. Mm-hmm.	no
32558	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	it was - I  think,  it is was a really key	no
32559	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	uh  starting  point for us that we actually got our alignment. When  we  were working together we got our initial alignments from Decipher,	no
32560	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
32561	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	uh  at the  time.   Uh.	no
32562	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
32563	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
32564	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	And.  Later  we got  away  from it because - because once we had decent  systems  going	no
32565	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
32566	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	then it was - it was typically better to use our  own  systems cuz they were self- consistent but - but certainly to start off when we were	no
32567	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	trying to recover from our initial hundred and forty percent error uh rate. Uh.  But that was a - that was a good - good - good way to  start.	no
32568	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
32569	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	And we're not  quite  that bad with our - our Switchboard systems but it was - they certainly aren't as good as S_R_I's, so -	no
32570	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	O_K.	no
32571	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
32572	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	W- What  is  the performance on s- the best Switchboard system that we've done?	no
32573	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
32574	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Roughly?	no
32575	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Well, the  hybrid  system we never got better than about fifty percent	no
32576	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	error. And uh it was -  I think there's just a whole lot of things that uh no one ever had time for. We never  did  really	no
32577	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	fix up the dictionary.	no
32578	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Uh we always had a list of a half dozen things that we were gonna do and - and a lot of them were pretty simple and we never did.	no
32579	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
32580	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mmm.	no
32581	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	But that w- Even  that  - that number -	no
32582	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Uh, we never did an- never did any adaptation  uh, we never did any -	no
32583	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
32584	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	And - And  that  number I think was on  Switchboard-one  data, right?	no
32585	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Where the error rate now is in the  twenties.	no
32586	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So, um.	no
32587	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah. Yeah.	no
32588	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So we were - Yeah. We were	no
32589	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	That's yet s-	no
32590	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	probably at least a factor or two off.	no
32591	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
32592	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
32593	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So it would be - So it would be good t- to sort of r- re- uh - just at least to give us an idea of how well the hybrid system would do.	no
32594	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
32595	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
32596	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	But I think - again it's -	no
32597	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah. It's the conver- it's the s-	no
32598	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	conversational speech bit.	no
32599	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Because our - our Broadcast News system is actually pretty good.  He knows .	no
32600	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
32601	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
32602	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	And the  other  thing that that would help us to evaluate is to see how well the M_L_ P  is trained up. Right?	no
32603	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Because it's a pretty good um	no
32604	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
32605	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	indicator of that.	no
32606	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So it's sort  of a sanity check of the M_L_ P  outputs  before we go ahead and train up the -	no
32607	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	uh you know, use them as a basis for the tandem system.	no
32608	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
32609	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah. It'll  still  probably be worse. I mean, it's - it'd be context independent and so on. But.	no
32610	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	No.	no
32611	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Sure.	no
32612	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Should we - Should we bother with um using the net	no
32613	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Not - But -	no
32614	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	before doing uh embedded	no
32615	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	training?	no
32616	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I mean should - should we even  use  that? Or should I just go straight to -	no
32617	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Oh  oh  that's  a good question. Yeah, we - we weren't sure whether it's worth to just use the alignments um	no
32618	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	from the S_R_ I  recognizer or whether to actually go through one or more iterations of embedded training where you realign.	no
32619	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Try it.	no
32620	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	You run it? Keep - keep both versions? See which one's better?	no
32621	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Uh, yeah. I mean. I think I agree with Ad-	no
32622	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I mean basically you would then - You  proceed  with the embedded training. It's gonna take you a while to train at this net anyway. And while it's training you may as well test the one you have and see how it  did.	no
32623	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
32624	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
32625	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
32626	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	O_K.	no
32627	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mmm.	no
32628	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Alright.	no
32629	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I could make arguments either way. You know, it's - Sort of given up guessing.	no
32630	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	But - But so I - Well but i- But in your experience I mean uh have you seen	no
32631	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	big improvements in s- on some tasks with embedded training? Or was it sort of small-ish uh improvements that you got-	no
32632	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Uh well. It depended on the task. I mean I think in this one I would sort of expect it to be important because we're coming from	no
32633	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
32634	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	uh, alignments that were achieved with an  extremely  different system.	no
32635	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	That are from another -	no
32636	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
32637	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
32638	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Although,	no
32639	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Uh.	no
32640	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I mean we've done it with - When we were combining with the Cambridge  recurrent  neural net, embedded training made it  worse.	no
32641	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Which I've never figured out.	no
32642	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right. But I mean i-	no
32643	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I think it's a bug.	no
32644	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So you - you started training with outputs from a - with alignments that were generated by the Cambridge uh system?	no
32645	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yep.	no
32646	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	And then -	no
32647	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Uh. Hmm.	no
32648	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
32649	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
32650	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Well, that might probably just - Hmm. That was  probably  because your initial  system  - I mean  your  system was ba- worse than Cambridge's.	no
32651	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	And you -	no
32652	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Um.	no
32653	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Was it? I don't think it was.	no
32654	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	No they were - they were comparable.	no
32655	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	It wasn't?	no
32656	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	No.	no
32657	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Really?	no
32658	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	They were very close.	no
32659	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
32660	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	That's  weird.	no
32661	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Excuse me?	no
32662	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	That's - That's  weird.	no
32663	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	That's  what  I  said.	no
32664	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Oh!	no
32665	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	No I mean it's weird that it did - I'm sorry. It's w-   It's weird that it got worse.	no
32666	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	That's  ambiguous.	no
32667	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Um. No. Uh.	no
32668	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Tha- u- we- we've see- I mean - and wi- with the numbers - O_G_I numbers task we've seen a number of times people doing embedded trainings and things not getting better.	no
32669	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Oh actually it's not  that  weird because we have seen -	no
32670	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	We have seen cases where acoustic - retraining the acoustic models after some other change made matters worse rather than better.	no
32671	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah. It just -	no
32672	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
32673	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	But I- But I would - I would  suspect  that something that - that had um a very different	no
32674	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Um	no
32675	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	feature set, for instance - I mean they were using pretty diff- similar feature sets to us.	no
32676	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yep.	no
32677	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I - I would expect that something that had a different feature set would - would uh benefit from -	no
32678	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
32679	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	What about uh  hidden  unit size  on this.  Oh.	no
32680	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Oh, wait a minute, and the other thing uh, sorry, it was - the other thing is that what was in  common	no
32681	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	to the Cambridge system and our system is they  both  were training posteriors.	no
32682	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right.	no
32683	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So I mean, uh,  that's  another pretty big difference and	no
32684	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Ah  yeah. That's another big difference.	no
32685	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	uh, one bac- at least -	no
32686	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Back at -	no
32687	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	You mean with soft targets?	no
32688	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Or - ?	no
32689	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Sorry, I'm sor- I missed - What - What's the key issue here?	no
32690	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Oh, that uh	no
32691	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	both the Cambridge system and our system were - were training	no
32692	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	posteriors. And if we're - we're coming from alignments coming from the S_R_I system, it's a  likelihood-based  system.	no
32693	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	So - so that's  another  difference. I mean. You know, there's diffe- different front-end	no
32694	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
32695	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	different - different uh, um,	no
32696	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	training criterion -	no
32697	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Uh, I would  think  that in a- that an embedded  uh	no
32698	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	embedded uh	no
32699	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	training would have at least a good shot of improving it some more. But we don't know.	no
32700	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
32701	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	O_K.	no
32702	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	You gonna say something?	no
32703	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah. I was wondering uh you know what	no
32704	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	size net I should -	no
32705	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Anybody have any intuitions or suggestions?	no
32706	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Uh, how much training data?	no
32707	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Well, I was gonna start off with the  small  train set.	no
32708	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	And how - How many hours is that?	no
32709	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	That's why I was - I - I'm not sure how much that is.	no
32710	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Uh, I think that has about -	no
32711	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Well i- you'd - would be gender-dependent training, right? So - So I think it's - uh that's about	no
32712	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Gender-dependent, yeah.	no
32713	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	mmm, something like thirty hours.	no
32714	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Thirty hours.	no
32715	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Thirty hours per gender.	no
32716	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I'm not sure what  this'll  mean.	no
32717	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	In the small training set?	no
32718	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I - I  think  so. I'll -	no
32719	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Hello?	no
32720	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Excuse me?	no
32721	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	It's definitely less than a hundred - You know, it's more like -	no
32722	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Alright.	no
32723	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	like thirty forty hours something like that.	no
32724	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Wrong number.	no
32725	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	They called to tell us that?	no
32726	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
32727	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no
32728	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Um. So. Uh.	no
32729	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I mean, I  didn't  want to do  too  big, just -	no
32730	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	after run-	no
32731	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right. So  At least a couple thousand hidden units.	no
32732	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
32733	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I mean. It's - it's th- the thing I'll - I'll think about it a little more but it - it'd be toss up between two thousand and four thousand.	no
32734	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mmm.	no
32735	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	You  definitely  wouldn't want the eight thousand. It's m- It's more than -	no
32736	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	And a  thousand  is too  small?	no
32737	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Oh let me think about it, but I think that - that uh th- at some point there's diminishing returns.	no
32738	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
32739	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	I mean it doesn't actually get worse, typically, but it - but - but there is diminishing returns and you're doubling  the amount of time.	no
32740	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Mm-hmm.	no
32741	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Remember you'll have a smaller  output  layer so there's gonna be fewer parameters there. And then -	no
32742	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	But  not  by a  lot.	no
32743	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Not  by  much.  Fifty s- Fifty four to forty eight?	no

32746	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah. Yeah. It'll have a very tiny effect.	no
32747	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Right, because you used the  context  windows  and so the input to hidden is much, much larger.	no
32748	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no

32750	transcript	transcript_Bmr026	Yeah.	no

33042	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	O_ three seven eight.	no
33043	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So uh, you see, Don, the unbridled excitement of the work that we have on this project.  It's just uh -	no
33044	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	O_K.	no
33045	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Umh.	no
33046	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh,	no
33047	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	you know, it doesn't seem like a bad idea to have  that information.	no
33048	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And I'm surprised I sort of - I'm surprised I  forgot  that, but uh I think that would be a good thing to add.	no
33049	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, I - I'd - I think it's  some-	no
33050	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	After I just printed out a zillion of them.	no
33051	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, well, that's -	yes
33052	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, well, that's -	no
33053	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Um, so I - I do have a - a- an agenda suggestion.	no
33054	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh, we - I think the things that we talk about in this meeting	no
33055	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh tend to be a mixture of uh procedural uh mundane things and uh research points	no
33056	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	and um I was  thinking	no
33057	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I think it was a meeting a couple of weeks ago that we -	no
33058	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	we spent much of the time talking about the mundane stuff cuz that's easier to get out of the way and then we sort of drifted into the research and maybe five minutes into that Andreas had to leave.	no
33059	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So  uh I'm suggesting we turn it around and - and uh sort of we have - anybody has some	no
33060	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	mundane points that we could send an email later, uh hold them for a bit, and let's talk about the - the research-y kind of things.	no
33061	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Um, so um	no
33062	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	the one th- one thing I  know  that we have on that is uh we had talked a - a couple weeks before um	no
33063	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh about the uh - the stuff you were doing with - with uh	no
33064	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	um uh l- l- attempting to locate events,	no
33065	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	"we had a little go around trying to figure out what you meant by "" events "" but"	no
33066	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	"I think, you know, what  we  had meant by ""events"" I guess was uh"	no
33067	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	points of overlap between speakers.	no
33068	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	But I th- I gather from our discussion a little earlier today that you  also  mean	no
33069	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh interruptions with something  else  like some other noise.	no
33070	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33071	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yes?	no
33072	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh-huh. Yeah.	no
33073	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	You mean that as an event also.	no
33074	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So  at any rate  you were - you've - you've done some work on that and um	no
33075	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	To- right.	no
33076	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	then the other thing would be it might be nice to have a preliminary discussion of some of the other uh research	no
33077	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh areas that uh we're thinking about doing.	no
33078	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Um, I think	no
33079	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	especially since you - you haven't been in - in these meetings for a little bit, maybe you have some discussion of some of the p- the plausible things to look at now that we're starting to get data,	no
33080	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh and  one  of the things I know that  also  came up uh is some discussions that - that uh - that uh Jane had with Lokendra	no
33081	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh about some - some - some um uh work about	no
33082	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I - I - I d- I - I don't want to try to say cuz I -	no
33083	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I'll say it wrong,	no
33084	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	but anyway some - some potential collaboration there about - about the - about the - working with these data.	no
33085	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Oh. Sure.	no
33086	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So.	no
33087	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33088	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So, uh.	no
33089	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	You wanna just go around?	no
33090	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh.  Well, I don't know if we - if this is sort of like everybody has something to contribute sort of thing, I think there's just just a couple - a couple people primarily um but um	no
33091	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh, wh- why don't -	no
33092	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Actually I think that - that last one I just said we could do fairly quickly so why don't you - you start with that.	no
33093	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	O_K. Shall I - shall I just start? O_K.	yes
33094	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Actually I think that - that last one I just said we could do fairly quickly so why don't you - you start with that.	no
33095	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	O_K. Shall I - shall I just start? O_K.	no
33096	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, just explain what it was.	no
33097	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Um, so, uh, he was interested in the question of - you know, relating to his - to the research he presented recently,	no
33098	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	um of inference structures, and uh, the need to build in, um,	no
33099	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	this - this sort of uh mechanism for understanding of language. And he gave the example in his talk about how	no
33100	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	um, e- a- I'm remembering it just off the top of my head right now,  but it's something about how um,	no
33101	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	"i- ""Joe slipped"" you know, ""John had washed the floor"" or something like that."	no
33102	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And I don't have it quite right, but that kind of thing, where you have to draw the inference that, O_K, there's this time sequence,	no
33103	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	but  also  the - the - the causal aspects of the uh floor and - and how it might have been the  cause  of the fall and that	no
33104	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	um it was the other person who fell than the one who cleaned it and it -   These  sorts of things.   So,	no
33105	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I looked through the transcript that we have so far,  and um, fou- identified a couple different types of things of that type and um,	no
33106	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	one  of them was something like uh, during the course of the transcript, um	no
33107	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	um, w- we had gone through the part where everyone said which channel they were on and which device they were on,	no
33108	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	and um, the question was raised	no
33109	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	"""Well, should we restart the recording at this point?"""	no
33110	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	"And - and Dan Ellis said, ""Well, we're just so far ahead of the  game  right now  we really don't  need  to""."	no
33111	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	"Now, how would you interpret that without a lot of inference? So, the inferences that are involved are things like, O_K, so, how do you interpret ""ahead of the game""?"	no
33112	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	You know.	no
33113	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So it's the - it's	no
33114	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Hmm, metaphorically.	no
33115	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	i-	no
33116	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	What you - what you int- what you draw - you know, the conclusions that you need to draw are that space is involved in recording,	no
33117	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	that um, i- that  i- we  have  enough space,	no
33118	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	"and he continues, like ""we're so ahead of the game cuz now we have built-in downsampling""."	no
33119	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So you have to sort of get the idea that	no
33120	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	"um, ""ahead of the game"" is sp- speaking with respect to space limitations, that um that in fact downsampling is gaining us enough space, and that therefore we can keep the recording we've done so far."	no
33121	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	But there are a lot of different things like that.	no
33122	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So, do you think his interest is in using this as  a  data  source, or   training  material, or what?	no
33123	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well, I - I should maybe interject to say this started off with a discussion that I had with him, so	no
33124	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	um we were trying to think of ways that  his  interests could interact with ours and um	no
33125	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
33126	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh I thought that if we were going to project into the future when we had a lot of data,	no
33127	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh and um such things might be  useful  for that	no
33128	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	in or- before we invested too much uh effort into that he should uh, with Jane's help, look	no
33129	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	into some of the data that we're - already  have	no
33130	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
33131	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	and see, is there  anything  to this at  all?	no
33132	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	"Is there any point which you think that, you know, you could gain some advantage and some potential use for it. Cuz it  could  be that you'd look through it and you say ""well, this is just the wrong  task for - for him to pursue his -"""	no
33133	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Wrong, yeah.	no
33134	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And - and uh I  got  the impression from your mail that in fact there was enough things like this just in the little sample that - that you looked at that - that it's  plausible  at least.	no
33135	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	It's possible. Uh, he was - he - he - you know - We met and he was gonna go and uh you know, y- look through them more systematically and then uh meet  again.  So it's, you know, not a matter of a -	no
33136	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33137	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33138	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33139	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	But, yeah, I think -	no
33140	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I think it was optimistic.	no
33141	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So  anyway,  that's - that's e- a quite different thing from anything we've talked about that, you know, might - might - might come out from some of this.	no
33142	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	But he can use text, basically.	no
33143	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I mean, he's talking about just using text  pretty much, or - ?	no
33144	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	That's his major -	no
33145	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I mentioned several that w- had to do with implications drawn from intonational contours and  that wasn't as directly relevant to what he's doing.	no
33146	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	O_K.	no
33147	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	He's interested in these - these knowledge structures, inferences that you draw  i- from -	no
33148	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, interesting.	no
33149	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I mean, he certainly could use text, but we were in fact looking to see if there - is there - is there something in common between our interest in meetings and his interest in - in - in this stuff. So.	no
33150	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And I imagine that transcripts of speech - I mean text that is speech - probably has more of those than sort of prepared writing. I - I don't know whether it would or not, but it  seems  like it would.	no
33151	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I don't know, probably de- probably depends on what the prepared writing was. But.	no
33152	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, I don't think I would make that leap, because i- in narratives, you know - I mean, if you spell out everything in a narrative, it can be really tedious, so.	no
33153	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
33154	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, I'm just thinking, you know, when you're - when you're face to face, you have a lot of backchannel and -	no
33155	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Oh.   That  aspect.	no
33156	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And -	no
33157	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah. And so I think it's just easier to do that sort of broad inference jumping	no
33158	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	if it's face to face.	no
33159	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well -	no
33160	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	"I mean, so, if I just read that Dan was saying ""we're ahead of the game""  in that - in that context,"	no
33161	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33162	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I might not  realize  that he was talking about  disk  space as opposed to anything else.	no
33163	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	"I - you know, I - I had several that had to do with backchannels and this wasn't one of them. This - this one really does um m- make you leap from - So he said, you know, ""we're ahead of the game, w- we have built-in downsampling""."	no
33164	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh-huh.	no
33165	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
33166	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And the inference, i- if you had it written down, would be -	no
33167	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I guess it would be the same.	no
33168	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh-huh. But there are others that have backchanneling, it's just he was less interested in those.	no
33169	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Can I -	no
33170	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Sorry to interrupt. Um,	no
33171	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I f- f- f- I've -  @@   d-	no
33172	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	A minute - uh, several minutes ago, I, like, briefly was - was not listening and -	no
33173	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	"So who is "" he "" in this context?"	no
33174	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, there's a lot of pronoun -	no
33175	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	O_K.	no
33176	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	"So I was just realizing we've - You guys have been talking about ""he"" um"	no
33177	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I believe it.	no
33178	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	for at least uh, I don't know, three -	no
33179	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	three four minutes without ever mentioning the person's  name  again.	no
33180	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33181	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So this is - this is -	no
33182	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Actually to make it  worse,	no
33183	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	It's in my notes.	no
33184	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	this is - gonna be a big, big problem if you want to  later  do uh, you know, indexing, or	no
33185	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	"uh, Morgan uses ""you"" and ""you""  with gaze and  no  identification, or -"	no
33186	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	speech understanding of  any  sort.	no
33187	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	"I just wrote this down.  Yeah, actually. Cuz Morgan will say well, "" you  had some ideas"" and he never said Li- He looked -"	no
33188	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	You just wrote this?	no
33189	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33190	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well, I think he's doing that  intentionally,  aren't you?	no
33191	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right, so it's great. So this is really great because the  thing  is, because he's looking at the per- even for addressees  in  the conversation, I bet you could pick that up in the acoustics. Just because your gaze is also correlated with the directionality of your voice.	no
33192	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right.	no
33193	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33194	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
33195	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh-huh. Could be. Yeah. That would be tou-	no
33196	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Can we-	no
33197	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Oh,  that  would be  interesting.	no
33198	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33199	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, so that, I mean, to even know um when -	no
33200	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, if you have the P_Z_Ms you should be able to pick up	no
33201	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	what a person is looking at	no
33202	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	from their voice.	no
33203	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well,  especially  with  Morgan,  with the way we have the microphones arranged. I'm sort of right on axis and it would be very hard to tell.	no
33204	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right. Put Morgan always like this and -	no
33205	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh.	no
33206	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Oh, but you'd have the -	no
33207	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	You'd have fainter - Wouldn't you get fainter reception out here?	no
33208	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well, these -	no
33209	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Sure, but I think if I'm talking like  this?	no
33210	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right now I'm looking at  Jane  and talking, now I'm looking at  Chuck  and talking, I don't think the microphones would pick up that difference.	no
33211	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	But you don't have this - this problem.  Morgan is the one who does this most.	no
33212	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I see.	no
33213	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So if I'm talking at  you,  or I'm talking at  you.	no
33214	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	"I probably been affect- No, I th- I think I've been affected by too many conversations where we were talking about lawyers and talking about - and concerns about ""oh gee is somebody going to say something bad?"" and so on."	no
33215	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Lawyers.	no
33216	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And so I - so I'm - I'm tending to stay away from people's names even though uh -	no
33217	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I am too.	no
33218	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Even though you  could  pick up later  on,  just from the acoustics who you were t- who you were looking at.	no
33219	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I am too.	no
33220	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	"And we  did   mention  who ""he""  was."	no
33221	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33222	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Early in the conversation.	no
33223	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33224	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right, but I missed it. But - it was uh -	no
33225	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Do - Sh- Can I say or - or is that just too sensitive?	no
33226	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, yeah.	no
33227	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah. Yeah. No no, there's - No no, it isn't sensitive at all. I was just -	no
33228	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33229	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well -	no
33230	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I was just - I was overreacting just because we've been talking about it. It's O_K to -	no
33231	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And in fact, it  is  - it is - it  is  sensitive. I - I came up with something from the Human Subjects people that I wanted to	no
33232	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	No, but that - it's interesting.	no
33233	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	mention. I mean, it fits into the m- area of the mundane, but they  did  say -	no
33234	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	"You know, I asked her very specifically about this clause of how, um, you know, it says ""no individuals will be identified  uh, ""in any publication using the data."" O_K, well, individuals being identified, let's say you have a - a snippet that says,"	no
33235	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	"""Joe s- uh thinks such-and-such about - about this field, but I think he's wrongheaded."""	no
33236	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	"Now I mean, we're - we're gonna be careful not to have the "" wrongheaded "" part in there, but - but you know, let's say we say,"	no
33237	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	"you know, ""Joe  used  to think so-and-so about this area, in his publication he says that but I think he's changed his mind."" or whatever."	no
33238	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	b- But I -	no
33239	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Then the issue of - of being able to trace Joe, because we know he's well-known in this field, and all this and - and tie it to the speaker,	no
33240	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	whose name was just mentioned a moment ago, can be sensitive. So I think it's really - really kind of adaptive and wise to not mention names any more than we have to because if there's a slanderous aspect to it, then how much to we wanna be able to have to remove?	no
33241	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, well, there's that.	no
33242	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	But I - I mean I think also to some extent it's just educating the Human Subjects people, in a  way,  because there's -	no
33243	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	If uh - You know, there's court transcripts, there's - there's transcripts of radio shows -  I mean people say people's names all the time.	no
33244	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So I think it - it can't be bad to say people's names.	no
33245	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	It's just that - i- I mean you're right that there's more poten- If we never say anybody's name,	no
33246	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	then there's no chance of - of - of slandering anybody, but -	no
33247	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	But, then it won't - I mean, if we - if we - Yeah. I mean we should do whatever's natural in a meeting if - if we weren't being recorded.	no
33248	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	It's not a meeting.	no
33249	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33250	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right, so I - So my behavior is probably not natural. So.	no
33251	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	"""If Person X_ -"""	no
33252	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well, my feeling on it was that it wasn't really important who said it, you know.	no
33253	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33254	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well, if you ha- since you have to um	no
33255	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	go over the transcripts later  anyway,  you could make it one of the	no
33256	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	jobs of the  people who  do  that to mark u-	no
33257	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well, we t- we t- we  talked  about this during the anon- anonymization. If we wanna go through and extract from the	no
33258	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right.	no
33259	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	audio and the written every time someone says a name.	no
33260	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And I thought that our conclusion was that we didn't want to do that.	no
33261	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, we really can't. But a- actually, I'm sorry. I really would like to push - finish this off. So it's -	no
33262	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I understand. No I just - I just was suggesting that it's not a bad policy p- potentially. So, we need to talk about this later.	no
33263	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, I di- I didn't  intend  it an a policy though.	no
33264	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	It was - it was just it was just unconscious - well, semi-conscious behavior. I sorta knew I was doing it but it was -	no
33265	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh-huh.	no
33266	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	"Well, I  still  don't know who ""he""  is."	no
33267	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	"No, you have to say, you still don't know who "" he "" is, with  that  prosody."	no
33268	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	"I - I do- I don't  remember  who ""he"" is."	no
33269	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Ah. Uh, we were talking about Dan at one point  and we were talking about Lokendra at another point. And I don't - I don't remember which - which part.	no
33270	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Oh.	no
33271	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, depends on which one you mean.	no
33272	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	It's ambiguous, so it's O_K.	no
33273	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh, I think -	no
33274	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well, the inference structures was Lokendra.	no
33275	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	But no. The inference stuff was - was - was Lokendra. O_K. That makes sense, yeah.	no
33276	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.	no
33277	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And the downsampling must have been Dan.	no
33278	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Um -	no
33279	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33280	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Good -  Yeah.  Yeah, you could do all these inferences, yeah.	yes
33281	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33282	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Good -  Yeah.  Yeah, you could do all these inferences, yeah.	no
33283	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	It's an inference.	no
33284	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33285	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33286	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Um, I - I would like to move it into - into uh what Jose uh has been doing because he's actually been doing something. So.	no
33287	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33288	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh-huh.	no
33289	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	O_K.  Well-	no
33290	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	As opposed to the  rest  of us.	no
33291	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right.	no
33292	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	O_K. I - I remind that me - my first objective eh, in the project is to - to study difference parameters to - to find a - a good solution to detect eh, the overlapping zone in eh speech recorded.	no
33293	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	But eh,  tsk,   ehhh	no
33294	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	In that way  I -	no
33295	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I -	no
33296	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I begin to - to study and to analyze the ehn - the recorded speech eh the different session to - to find and to locate and to mark eh the - the different overlapping zone.	no
33297	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And eh so eh I was eh - I am transcribing the - the first session and I - I have found eh, eh one thousand acoustic events,	no
33298	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	eh  besides  the overlapping zones,	no
33299	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	eh I - I - I mean the eh breaths eh aspiration eh, eh,  talk  eh, eh, clap, eh -	no
33300	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I don't know what is the different names eh you use to - to name the - the  n-	no
33301	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Nonspeech sounds?	no
33302	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	speech	no
33303	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33304	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Oh, I don't think we've been doing it at that level of detail.	no
33305	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So.	no
33306	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33307	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Eh,  I - I - I do- I don't need to - to - to mmm  - to m-	no
33308	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	to label the - the different acoustic, but I prefer because eh	no
33309	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I would like to - to study if eh, I -	no
33310	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I will find eh, eh, a good eh parameters eh to detect overlapping I would like to - to - to test these parameters eh with the - another eh, eh acoustic events,	no
33311	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	to nnn -  to eh - to find what is the ehm - the  false   - eh, the false eh hypothesis eh, nnn, which eh are produced when we use the - the ehm - this eh parameter - eh I mean pitch eh, eh, difference eh, feature -	no
33312	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
33313	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	You know -	no
33314	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So it was -	no
33315	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I think some of these um that are the nonspeech overlapping events	no
33316	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Umh.	no
33317	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	may be difficult even for  humans  to tell that there's two there.	no
33318	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33319	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I mean, if it's a tapping sound, you wouldn't necessarily - or, you know, something like that, it'd be - it might be hard to know that it was two separate events.	no
33320	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33321	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33322	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33323	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33324	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well -	no
33325	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	You weren't talking about just  overlaps  were you? You were just talking about acoustic  events.	no
33326	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Ye-	no
33327	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I - I - I - I t- I t-	no
33328	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Someone starts, someone stops -	no
33329	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I talk eh about eh acoustic events in general,	no
33330	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33331	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	but eh my - my objective eh will be eh to study eh overlapping zone.	no
33332	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Oh.	no
33333	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
33334	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Eh?	no
33335	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	How many overlaps were there uh in it?	no
33336	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	n-	no
33337	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Eh in twelve minutes I found eh, eh one thousand acoustic events.	no
33338	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	No no, how  many   of them were the overlaps of speech, though?	no
33339	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	How many? Eh almost eh three hundred eh in one session in five - eh in forty-five minutes.	no
33340	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Oh, God!	no
33341	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Ugh.	no
33342	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Three hundred overlapping speech -	no
33343	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Alm- Three  hundred   overlapping zone.	no
33344	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Overlapping speech.	no
33345	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	With the overlapping zone, overlapping speech - speech what eh different duration.	no
33346	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Sure.	no
33347	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
33348	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Does this - ? So if you had an overlap involving three people, how many times was that counted?	no
33349	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, three people, two people. Eh, um I would like to consider eh one people with difference noise eh in the background, be-	no
33350	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	No no, but I think what she's asking is  if at some particular for some particular stretch you had  three  people talking, instead of  two,  did you call that  one  event?	no
33351	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Oh.	no
33352	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Oh.	no
33353	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33354	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I consider one event eh for th- for that eh for  all  the zone.	no
33355	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	This - th-	no
33356	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well -	no
33357	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I - I - I con- I consider - I consider eh an acoustic event, the overlapping zone, the period where three speaker or eh - are talking together.	no
33358	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So let's -	no
33359	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	For-	no
33360	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Umh.	no
33361	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So let's say me and Jane are talking at the same time, and then Liz starts talking  also  over all of us. How many events would  that  be?	no
33362	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So- I don't understand.	no
33363	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So,  two  people are talking,	no
33364	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah?	no
33365	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	and then a  third  person starts talking. Is there an event right here?	no
33366	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Hmm.	no
33367	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Eh no.	no
33368	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	No no.	no
33369	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	For me is the overlapping zone, because -	no
33370	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So i- if two or more people are talking.	no
33371	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I see.	no
33372	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	because you - you have s- you have more one - eh,	no
33373	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	more one voice eh, eh produced in a - in - in a moment.	no
33374	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	O_K.	no
33375	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah. So I think - Yeah. We just wanted to understand how you're defining it. So then,	no
33376	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33377	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	If-	no
33378	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	in the region between - since there - there is some continuous region,	no
33379	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	in  between  regions where there is only one person speaking. And one contiguous region like that you're calling an event.	no
33380	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh-huh.	no
33381	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh-huh. Yeah.	no
33382	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Is it - Are you calling the  beginning  or the  end  of it the event,  or are you calling the entire  length  of it the event?	no
33383	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I consider the - the, nnn - the nnn, nnn - eh, the  entirety   eh,	no
33384	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	eh, all - all the time there were - the voice has overlapped.	no
33385	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	O_K.	no
33386	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	This is the idea.	no
33387	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	But eh I - I don't  distinguish   between the - the numbers of eh speaker.	no
33388	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh, I'm not considering  eh the - the - ehm	no
33389	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	eh, the fact of eh, eh, for example, what did you say?	no
33390	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Eh at first eh, eh two talkers are uh, eh speaking,	no
33391	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	and eh, eh a third person eh join to - to that.	no
33392	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	For me, it's eh - it's eh, all overlap zone,	no
33393	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	with eh several numbers of speakers is eh, eh the same acoustic event.	no
33394	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Wi- but - uh, without any mark between the zone -	no
33395	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	of the overlapping zone with two speakers eh speaking together,	no
33396	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	and the zone with the three speakers. It -	no
33397	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	That would j- just be one.	no
33398	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	One. One.	no
33399	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	O_K.	no
33400	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Eh, with eh, a beginning mark and the ending mark.	no
33401	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Got it.	no
33402	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Because eh  for me, is the -	no
33403	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	is the zone with eh some kind of eh distortion the spectral. I don't mind - By the  moment,  by the  moment.  I - I don't -	no
33404	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well, but -	no
33405	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	But you could imagine that three people talking has a different spectral characteristic than  two.  So.	no
33406	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, but eh - but eh I have to study.	no
33407	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Could.	no
33408	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	You had to start somewhere.	no
33409	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33410	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	What will  happen in a  general way, I -	no
33411	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	We just w-	no
33412	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So there's a lot of overlap. So.	no
33413	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yep.	no
33414	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I don't  know  what eh will - will happen with the -	no
33415	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	That's a lot of overlap, yeah, for forty-five minutes.	no
33416	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So again, that's - that's three - three hundred in forty-five minutes that are - that are  speakers,  just speakers.	no
33417	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah?	no
33418	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33419	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33420	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	But a - a - a th-	no
33421	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh- huh.  O_K. Yeah. So that's about eight per minute.	no
33422	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33423	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah,  but -	no
33424	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	But a thousand events in twelve minutes, that's -	no
33425	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33426	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh.	no
33427	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	But that can include taps.	no
33428	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	But -	no
33429	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well, but a thousand  taps  in eight minutes is a l- in twelve minutes is a lot.	no
33430	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	General.	no
33431	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33432	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Actually -	no
33433	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I - I con- I consider -	no
33434	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I consider acoustic events eh, the silent too.	no
33435	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Silent.	no
33436	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Silence starting or silence ending -	no
33437	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, silent,  ground  to - bec-	no
33438	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	to detect - eh because I consider acoustic event all the things are not eh speech.	no
33439	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Oh, O_K.	no
33440	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
33441	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Oh.	no
33442	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	In ge- in - in - in a general point of view.	no
33443	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Oh.	no
33444	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	O_K, so how many of those thousand were silence?	no
33445	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Not speech - not speech or too  much  speech.	no
33446	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Alright.	no
33447	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	in the per-	no
33448	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Too much speech.	no
33449	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right.	no
33450	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So how many of those thousand were silence, silent sections?	no
33451	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33452	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh silent, I - I - I -	no
33453	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I don't - I - I  haven't  the -	no
33454	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	eh I - I would like to - to do a stylistic	no
33455	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	study and give you	no
33456	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33457	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	eh with the report eh from eh	no
33458	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33459	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33460	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	the - the study from the -	no
33461	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	the - the session -  one  session.	no
33462	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And I - I found that eh another thing.	no
33463	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	When eh  eh I w- I -	no
33464	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I was eh look at eh nnn, the difference speech file,	no
33465	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	um, for example, eh if eh we use the ehm - the mixed file, to - to transcribe,	no
33466	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	the - the events and the words,	no
33467	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I - I saw that eh the eh speech signal, collected by the eh this kind of mike - eh of this kind of mike,	no
33468	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	eh are different	no
33469	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yep.	no
33470	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	from the eh mixed signal	no
33471	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	eh, we eh - collected by headphone. And -	no
33472	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right.	no
33473	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33474	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	It's right. But the problem is  the following.	no
33475	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	The - the - the -	no
33476	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I - I - I knew that eh the signal eh, eh would be different, but eh	no
33477	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	the - the problem is eh, eh we eh detected eh difference events in the speech file eh collected by - by that mike	no
33478	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh qui- compared with the mixed file.	no
33479	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well -	no
33480	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And so if - when you transcribe eh only eh using the nnn - the mixed file,	no
33481	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	it's possible - eh if you use the transcription	no
33482	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	to evaluate a different system,	no
33483	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	it's possible you	no
33484	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	eh - in the eh i-	no
33485	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	and you use the eh speech file collected by the eh  fet  mike,	no
33486	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	to eh - to nnn -	no
33487	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	to do the experiments  with the - the system,	no
33488	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
33489	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right.	no
33490	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	its possible to evaluate eh, eh - or to consider eh acoustic events that -	no
33491	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	which you marked eh in the mixed file,	no
33492	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	but eh they don't appear in the eh speech signal eh collected by the - by the mike.	no
33493	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right.	no
33494	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	The - the reason that I generated the mixed file was for	no
33495	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I_B_M to do  word  level transcription, not speech event transcription.	no
33496	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33497	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah. Oh, it's a good idea. It's a good idea I think.	no
33498	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So I agree that if someone wants to do  speech  event transcription, that	no
33499	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33500	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	the mixed signals here - I mean, if I'm tapping on the  table,  you- it's not gonna show up on  any  of the  mikes,	no
33501	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33502	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	but it's gonna show up  rather   loudly  in the P_Z_M. So.	no
33503	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33504	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33505	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So and I - I -	no
33506	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I say eh that eh,	no
33507	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	eh, or this eh only because eh I c- I - I -	no
33508	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	in my opinion,	no
33509	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	it's necessary to eh - to eh - to put the transcription on the speech file,	no
33510	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	collected by the objective signal.	no
33511	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I mean the - the - the signal collected by the -	no
33512	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
33513	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	eh, the real mike in the future, in the prototype	no
33514	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
33515	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	The - the - the far-field, yeah.	no
33516	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	to - to eh correct	no
33517	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	the initial eh segmentation	no
33518	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	eh with the eh real speech you have to - to analyze - you have to - to process.	no
33519	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Because I - I found a difference.	no
33520	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, well, just - I mean, just in that - that one s-	no
33521	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
33522	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	ten second, or whatever it was, example that Adam had that - that we - we passed on to others a few months ago,	no
33523	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	there was that business where I g- I guess it was Adam and Jane were talking at the same time and -	no
33524	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
33525	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	and uh,	no
33526	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	in the close-talking mikes you couldn't hear the overlap,	no
33527	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	and in the distant mike you  could.  So	no
33528	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	yeah, it's clear that if you wanna study -	no
33529	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	That's  good.	no
33530	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	if you wanna find all the places where there were overlap, it's probably better to use a distant mike. On the other hand,	no
33531	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	there's  other  phenomena that are going on at the same time for which it might be useful to look at the  close-talking  mikes, so it's -	no
33532	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33533	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	But  why  can't you use the  combination  of the close-talking mikes,  time  aligned?	no
33534	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	If you use the combination of the close-talking mikes, you  would  hear Jane  interrupting  me, but you wouldn't hear the  paper  rustling.	no
33535	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And so if you're interested in -	no
33536	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Were you interrupting  him  or was he interrupting  you?	no
33537	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Some  of it's masking - masked.	no
33538	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I - I mean if you're interested in speakers overlapping other speakers and not the other kinds of nonspeech, that's not a problem, right?	no
33539	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33540	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right.	no
33541	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right.	no
33542	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33543	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Although the  other  issue is that the  mixed close-talking mikes - I mean, I'm doing weird normalizations and things like that.	no
33544	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33545	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	But it's known. I mean, the normalization you do is over the whole conversation isn't it, over the whole meeting.	no
33546	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yep.	no
33547	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right.	no
33548	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yep.	no
33549	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So if you wanted to study people overlapping people, that's not a problem.	no
33550	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33551	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right.	no
33552	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I - I - I think eh  - I saw the nnn - the -	no
33553	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	eh but eh I eh - I have eh any results.	no
33554	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I - I - I saw the - the speech file collected by eh the  fet  mike,	no
33555	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	and eh eh signal eh to eh - to noise eh relation is eh low.	no
33556	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
33557	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	It's low. It's very low. You would comp- if we compare it with eh the headphone. And	no
33558	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yep.	no
33559	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I - I found that nnn - that eh,  ehm,	no
33560	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Did - Did you k-	no
33561	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	pr-  probably,	no
33562	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I'm not sure eh by the moment, but it's - it's  probably  that eh	no
33563	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	a lot of eh,  eh for example, in the overlapping zone,	no
33564	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	on eh - in - in several eh parts of the files	no
33565	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	where you - you can find eh, eh	no
33566	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	eh, smooth eh eh speech eh from eh one eh eh talker	no
33567	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.	no
33568	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	in the - in the meeting,	no
33569	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	it's probably in - in that eh -	no
33570	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	in - in those files you - you can not find - you can not process because eh it's confused with - with noise.	no
33571	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
33572	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And there are  a lot of  - I think. But I have to study with more detail.	no
33573	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	But eh my idea is to - to process only  nnn, this eh - nnn, this kind of s- of eh speech.	no
33574	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Because I think it's more realistic. I'm not sure it's a good idea, but eh -	no
33575	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	No - i-	no
33576	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well, it's more realistic but it'll - it'll be a lot harder.	no
33577	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33578	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well, it'd be hard, but on the other hand as you point out, if your - if i-	no
33579	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	if - if your concern is to get uh the overlapping people - people's speech, you will - you will get that somewhat better. Um,	no
33580	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm. Yeah.	no
33581	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Are you making any use - uh you were - you were working with th- the data that had already been  transcribed.	no
33582	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	With - By Jane.	no
33583	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Does it uh -	no
33584	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yes. Now um did you make any  use  of that?	no
33585	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33586	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	See I was wondering cuz we st- we have these ten hours of other stuff that is not yet transcribed. Do you -	no
33587	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33588	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33589	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	The - the transcription by Jane, t- eh i- eh,	no
33590	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I - I - I want to use to - to nnn,  eh	no
33591	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	to put - i- i- it's a reference for me.	no
33592	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	But eh the transcription -	no
33593	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	eh for example, I - I don't - I - I'm not interested in the - in the - in the words,	no
33594	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	transcription words, eh	no
33595	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	transcribed eh eh in -	no
33596	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	eh follow in the -  in the - in the speech file,	no
33597	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	but eh eh Jane eh for example eh put a mark eh at the beginning eh of each eh talker,	no
33598	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	in the - in the meeting,	no
33599	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	um eh she - she nnn includes information	no
33600	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	about the zone where eh there are eh - there is an overlapping zone.	no
33601	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
33602	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	But eh there isn't any - any mark,	no
33603	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	time - temporal mark,	no
33604	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	to - to c- eh - to mmm  - e-heh, to label	no
33605	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	O_K.	no
33606	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	the beginning and the end of the - of the ta-	no
33607	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right, so she is -	no
33608	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I'm - I - I - I think eh we need this information to nnn -	no
33609	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right.	no
33610	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So the twelve - you - you - it took you twelve hours -	no
33611	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	of course this included maybe some - some time where you were learning about what - what you wanted to do, but -	no
33612	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	but uh, it took you something like twelve hours to mark the forty-five minutes, your s-	no
33613	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Twelve minutes.	no
33614	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Twelve  minutes.	no
33615	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Twelve  minutes!	no
33616	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Twelve minutes. Twelve.	no
33617	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I thought you did forty-five minutes of -	no
33618	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	No, forty-five minutes is the - is the session,  all the session.	no
33619	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Oh, you haven't done the whole session. This is just twelve minutes.  Oh.	no
33620	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Oh.	no
33621	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, all is the   the  session.	no
33622	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Tw- twelve hours of work	no
33623	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	to -  to segment eh and label eh twelve minutes from a session of part -	no
33624	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So  let me back up again. So the - when you said there were three hundred speaker overlaps, that's in twelve minutes?	no
33625	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	of f-	no
33626	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33627	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	No no no. I - I consider all the - all the session because eh I - I count the nnn - the nnn - the overlappings marked by - by Jane,	no
33628	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Oh, O_K.	no
33629	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	in - in - in - in the  fin- in - in the  forty-five minutes.	no
33630	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	O_K .	no
33631	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Oh, I see.	no
33632	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So it's three hundred in forty-five minutes, but you have - you have time uh, uh marked -	no
33633	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	twelve minute - the - the - the um overlaps in twelve minutes of it. Got it.	no
33634	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33635	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well, not just the overlaps,  everything.	no
33636	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So, can I ask -  can I ask whether you found - uh, you know, how accurate	no
33637	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh Jane's uh	no
33638	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh labels were as far as -	no
33639	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	you know, did she miss some overlaps? or did she n- ?	no
33640	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	But, by - by the moment, I - I don't compare,	no
33641	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	my - my temporal mark with eh Jane, but eh	no
33642	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
33643	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
33644	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I - I want to do it.	no
33645	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Because eh eh i- per- perhaps	no
33646	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I have eh errors in the - in the marks,	no
33647	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
33648	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I - and if I - I compare with eh Jane,	no
33649	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33650	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well -	no
33651	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	it's probably	no
33652	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I - I - I can correct	no
33653	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	and - and - and - to get eh eh a more accurately eh eh transcription in the file.	no
33654	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I-	no
33655	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well, also Jane - Jane was doing  word  level.	no
33656	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33657	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So we weren't  concerned  with  exactly when an overlap started and stopped.	no
33658	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33659	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right. Right. I'm expect- I'm not expecting -	no
33660	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well -	no
33661	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well, not only a word level, but actually I mean, you didn't need to	no
33662	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	No,  it's -	no
33663	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	show  the exact point of interruption, you just were showing at the level of the phrase or the level of the speech spurt, or -	no
33664	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right.	no
33665	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
33666	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yep.	no
33667	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well -	no
33668	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33669	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33670	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well, yeah, b- yeah, I would say time bin. So my - my goal is to get words with reference to a  time   bin,   beginning and end point. And - and sometimes, you know, it was like you could have an overlap where someone said something in the  middle,  but,	no
33671	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33672	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33673	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33674	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right.	no
33675	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33676	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	yeah, w- it just wasn't important for our purposes to have it that - i- disrupt that unit in order to have, you know, a- the words in the order in which they were spoken, it would have -	no
33677	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33678	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	it would have been hard with the interface that we have. Now, my - a- Adam's working on a of course, on a revised overlapping interface, but -	no
33679	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right.	no
33680	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh-huh. I - I - I think -	no
33681	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	It's - it's a good eh work, but eh I think we need eh eh more information.	no
33682	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	No, of  course.  I expect you to find  more  overlaps than - than Jane because you're looking at it at a much more detailed level.	no
33683	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33684	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Always  need more for -	no
33685	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	No, no. I - I have to go to - I want eh - I wanted to eh compare the - the transcription.	no
33686	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33687	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I have -	no
33688	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	But if it takes sixty to one -	no
33689	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well, I- but I have a suggestion about that. Um,	no
33690	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	obviously this is very, very time-consuming, and you're finding lots of things which I'm sure are gonna be very interesting,	no
33691	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	but in the interests of making progress, uh might I s- how - how would it affect your time if you only marked speaker overlaps?	no
33692	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Only.	no
33693	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yes. Do not mark any other events, but only mark speaker -  Do you think that would speed it  up  quite a bit?	no
33694	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33695	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh-huh.	no
33696	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	O_K.	no
33697	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	O_K.	no
33698	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Do y- do you think that would speed it up?	no
33699	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh, speed up your - your - your marking?	no
33700	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I - I - I - I w-	no
33701	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I - I wanted to - nnn, I don't understand very.	no
33702	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	It took you a long time  to mark twelve minutes. Now, my suggestion was for the other thirty-three -	no
33703	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33704	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Oh, yeah, yeah.	no
33705	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	On- only to mark - only to mark overlapping zone, but -	no
33706	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, and my question is, if you did that, if you followed my suggestion, would it take much less time?	no
33707	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Oh, yeah. Sure. Yeah sure.  Sure sure. Sure,	no
33708	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah O_K.  Then I think it's a good idea.  Then I think it's a good idea, because it-	no
33709	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	because I - I need a lot of time to - to put the label or to do that. Yeah.	no
33710	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, I mean, we- we know that there's noise.	no
33711	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And-	no
33712	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh-huh.	no
33713	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	There's - there's uh continual noise uh from fans and so forth, and there is uh more impulsive noise from uh taps and so forth and - and something in between with paper rustling.	no
33714	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33715	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	We know that all that's there and it's a g- worthwhile thing to study,	no
33716	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
33717	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	but obviously it takes a lot of time to mark all of these things.	no
33718	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33719	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Whereas th- i- I would  think  that uh you - we can study  more  or less as a distinct phenomenon the overlapping of people talking.	no
33720	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh-huh. O_K. O_K.	no
33721	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So.	no
33722	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Then you can get the - Cuz you need - If it's three hundred uh - i- i- it sounds like you probably only have fifty or sixty or seventy	no
33723	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	events right now that are really -	no
33724	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33725	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And - and you need to have a lot  more  than that to have any kind of uh even visual sense of - of what's going on, much less any kind of reasonable statistics.	no
33726	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right.	no
33727	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Now, why do you need to mark speaker overlap by  hand  if you can infer it from the relative energy in the - I mean, you shouldn't  need  to do this p- completely by hand, right?	no
33728	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well, that's -	no
33729	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	That's what I was gonna bring up.	no
33730	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Um, O_K, yeah. So let's back up because you weren't here for an earlier conversation.	no
33731	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I'm sorry.	no
33732	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So the idea was that what he was going to be doing was experimenting with different measures such as the increase in energy,	no
33733	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	such as the energy in the L_P_C residuals, such as -  I mean there's a bunch of things -	no
33734	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
33735	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I mean, increased energy is -is sort of an obvious one. Yeah. Um, and	no
33736	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	In the  far-field  mike.	no
33737	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Oh, O_K.	no
33738	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh, it's not obvious, I mean, you could - you could do the dumbest thing	no
33739	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	and get - get it ninety percent of the time. But when you	no
33740	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	start going  past  that and trying to do  better,  it's not obvious what combination of features	no
33741	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	is gonna give you the - you know, the right detector. So the idea is to have some ground truth first.	no
33742	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	"And so the i- the idea of the manual marking was to say ""O_K this, i- you know, it's - it's really here""."	no
33743	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	But I think Liz is saying why not get it out of the transcripts?	no
33744	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	What I mean is  get it from the  close-talking  mikes.	no
33745	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh, yeah. We t- we t- w-	no
33746	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	A- or ge- get a first pass from those, and then go through sort of - It'd be a lot faster probably to -	no
33747	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	we t- we talked about that.	no
33748	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And you can -	no
33749	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, that's his, uh -	no
33750	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	We - we -	no
33751	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	we  talked  about that. s- But so it's a bootstrapping thing and the thing is,	no
33752	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, I just -	no
33753	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	the idea was, i- we i- i- we thought it would be useful for him to look at the data anyway,	no
33754	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	and - and then whatever he could mark would be helpful,	no
33755	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right.	no
33756	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	and we could -	no
33757	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh it's a question of what you bootstrap  from.  You know, do you bootstrap from a simple measurement which is right most of the time and then you g- do better,	no
33758	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	or do you bootstrap from some human being looking at it and then -	no
33759	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	then  do your simple measurements, uh from the close-talking mike.	no
33760	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I mean, even with the close-talking mike you're not gonna get it right all the time.	no
33761	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well, that's what I wonder, because um - or how bad it is, be- um, because that would be interesting especially because the bottleneck is the  transcription.  Right?	no
33762	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well-	no
33763	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I'm working on a program to do that, and -	no
33764	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I mean, we've got a lot more data than we have transcriptions for. We have the audio data, we have the close-talking mike, so I mean it seems like one kind of project that's not perfect, but -	no
33765	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33766	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	um, that you can get the  training  data for pretty quickly is, you know, if you infer form the close-talking mikes where the on-off points are of speech, you know, how can we detect that from a far-field?	no
33767	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right, we discussed that.	no
33768	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And -	no
33769	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Oh.	no
33770	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I've - I've written a program to do that, and it, uh -	no
33771	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	O_K, I'm sorry I missed the -  @@	no
33772	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	It's O_K.	no
33773	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	and -	no
33774	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	so - but it's - it's doing something very, very simple. It just takes a threshold, based on - on the volume,	no
33775	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh-huh.	no
33776	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Or you can set the threshold low and then weed out the false alarms by hand. Yeah.	no
33777	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right, by hand. Yeah.	no
33778	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	um, and then it does a median filter, and then it looks for runs.	no
33779	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And, it seems to work, I've - I'm sort of fiddling with the parameters,	no
33780	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	to get it to actually  generate  something,	no
33781	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	and I haven't - I don't - what I'm working on -  was  working on - was getting it to a form where we can import it into the user interface that we have,  into Transcriber.	no
33782	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And so - I told - I said it would take about a day. I've worked on it for about half a day, so give me another half day and I- we'll have something we can play with.	no
33783	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I have to go.	no
33784	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	O_K.	no
33785	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	See, this is where we really need the Meeting Recorder query stuff to be working, because we've had these meetings and we've had this discussion about this, and I'm sort of remembering a  little  bit about what we decided,	no
33786	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right. I'm sorry. I just -	no
33787	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	but I couldn't remember  all  of it.  So,	no
33788	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	It-	no
33789	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	But -	no
33790	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I think it was partly that,	no
33791	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	you know,	no
33792	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	give somebody a chance to actually look at the data and see what these are like,	no
33793	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	partly that we have e- some ground  truth  to compare against, you know, when - when he - he gets his thing going,	no
33794	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
33795	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh, and -	no
33796	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well, it's definitely good to have somebody look at it. I was just thinking as a way to speed up	no
33797	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	That was - that was exactly the notion that - that - that we discussed. So.	no
33798	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
33799	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	you know, the amount of -	no
33800	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33801	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	O_K.	no
33802	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Thanks.	no
33803	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Another  thing we discussed was um that -	no
33804	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	It looks good.	no
33805	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I have to go.	no
33806	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I'll be in touch. Thanks.	no
33807	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	S- See ya.	no
33808	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Just give me an email.	no
33809	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	O_K.	no
33810	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33811	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Was that um there m-  there was this already a script I believe uh that Dan had written,	no
33812	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	that uh handle bleedthrough, I mean cuz you have this - this close - you have contamination from other people who speak loudly.	no
33813	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, and I haven't tried using that. It would probably help the program that I'm doing to first feed it through that.	no
33814	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	It's a cross-correlation filter.	no
33815	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So I - I haven't tried that, but that - If - It - it might be something - it might be a good way of cleaning it up a little.	no
33816	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So, some thought of maybe having -	no
33817	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, having that be a preprocessor and then run it through yours.	no
33818	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Exactly.	no
33819	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	But - but that's a refinement and I think we wanna see - try the simple thing first, cuz you add this complex thing up uh afterwards that does something good y- y- yo- you sort of wanna see what the simple thing does first.	no
33820	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yep.	no
33821	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	That's what we were discussing.	no
33822	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yep.	no
33823	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	But uh, having - having somebody have some experience, again, with - with uh - with marking it from a human standpoint, we're - I mean, I don't expect Jose	no
33824	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	to - to do it for uh f- fifty hours of -  of speech, but I mean we -	no
33825	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	if uh - if he could speed up what he was doing by just getting the speaker overlaps so that we had it, say, for forty-five minutes,	no
33826	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33827	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Sure.	no
33828	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Sure.	no
33829	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	then at least we'd have three hundred examples of it. And when - when uh Adam was doing his automatic thing he could then compare to that and see what it was different.	no
33830	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33831	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Oh yeah, definitely.	no
33832	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33833	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	You know, I did - I did uh something almost  identical  to this at one of my previous jobs, and it works pretty  well.  I mean, i- almost exactly what you described, an energy detector with a median filter, you look for runs.	no
33834	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And uh,  you know, you can -	no
33835	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	It seemed like the right thing to do.	no
33836	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah. I mean, you - you can get y- I mean, you get them pretty close.	no
33837	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	That was with zero literature search.	no
33838	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And so I think doing that to generate these	no
33839	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	possibilities and then going through and saying yes or no on  them   would be a quick way to - to do it. Yeah.	no
33840	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	That's good validation.	no
33841	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Is this proprietary?	no
33842	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, do you have a patent on it?	no
33843	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh.	no
33844	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	No. No.	no
33845	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	It was when I was working for the government.	no
33846	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Oh, then everybody owns it. It's the  people.	no
33847	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well, I mean, is this something that we could just  co-opt,  or is it - ?  No.  O_K.	no
33848	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Nah.	no
33849	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	@@	no
33850	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	@@	no
33851	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well, i- i- i- he's pretty close, anyway. I think - I think it's -	no
33852	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, he's - it - it doesn't take a long time.	no
33853	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right.	no
33854	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I just thought if it was tried and true, then -  and he's gone through additional levels of - of development.	no
33855	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Just output.	no
33856	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Although if you - if you have some parameters like what's a good window size for the median filter -	no
33857	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33858	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Oh!  I have to remember. I'll think about it, and try to remember.	no
33859	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And it might be  different  for government people.	no
33860	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	That's   alright .	no
33861	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, good enough for government work, as they say.	no
33862	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	They - they -	no
33863	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Di- dif- different - different bandwidth.	no
33864	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	They d-	no
33865	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I was doing pretty short, you know, tenth of a second,  sorts of numbers.	no
33866	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
33867	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	O_K.	no
33868	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh,	no

33870	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	if - if we want to uh -	no
33871	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So, uh, maybe we should move on to other - other things in limited time.	no
33872	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Can I ask one question about his statistics? So - so in the tw- twelve minutes,	no
33873	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33874	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33875	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	um, if we took three hundred and divided it by four, which is about the length of twelve minutes,	no
33876	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	i-	no
33877	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Um, I'd expect like there should be seventy-five overlaps. Did you find	no
33878	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh  more  than seventy-five overlaps in that period, or - ?	no
33879	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	More than?	no
33880	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	More than - How many overlaps in your twelve minutes?	no
33881	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	How many? Eh, not  @@  I-	no
33882	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Onl- only I - I transcribe eh only twelve minutes	no
33883	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
33884	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33885	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	from the	no
33886	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	but eh I - I don't co- eh - I don't count eh the - the overlap.	no
33887	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	The overlaps.  O_K.	no
33888	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I consider I - I - The - the nnn -	no
33889	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	The - the three hundred is eh considered only you - your transcription.	no
33890	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I have to -  to finish transcribing.	no
33891	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So.	no
33892	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I b- I bet they're  more,  because the  beginning  of the meeting had a lot more overlaps than - than sort of the middle.	no
33893	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33894	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Middle or end.	no
33895	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33896	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Because i- we're - we're dealing with the - Uh, in the early meetings, we're  recording  while we're saying who's talking on what microphone,  and things like that,  and that seems to be a  lot  of overlap.	no
33897	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I'm not sure.	no
33898	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33899	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33900	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I think it's an empirical question. I think we could find that out. I'm - I'm not sure that the beginning had more.	no
33901	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33902	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yep.	no
33903	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So - so I was gonna ask, I guess about any - any other things that - that - that either of you wanted to talk about, especially since	no
33904	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Andreas is leaving in five minutes, that - that you wanna go with.	no
33905	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Can I just ask about the data, like very straightforward question is where we are on the amount of data and the amount of transcribed data, just cuz I'm -	yes
33906	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Andreas is leaving in five minutes, that - that you wanna go with.	no
33907	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Can I just ask about the data, like very straightforward question is where we are on the amount of data and the amount of transcribed data, just cuz I'm -	no
33908	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I wanted to get a feel for that	no
33909	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	to sort of	no
33910	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	be able to know what - what can be done first and	no
33911	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right so there's this - this -	no
33912	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	like  how many meetings are we recording and -	no
33913	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	There's this forty-five minute piece that Jane transcribed.	no
33914	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	That piece was then uh sent to I_B_M so  they  could transcribe so we have some comparison point.	no
33915	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Then there's s- a larger piece that's been recorded and	no
33916	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	@@	no
33917	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh put on C_D-ROM and sent uh to I_B_M.	no
33918	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right? And then	no
33919	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	we don't know.	no
33920	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	How many  meetings  is that? Like - how many - t- ten - It's like ten meetings or something?	no
33921	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	What's that?	no
33922	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	That was about ten hours, and there was about -	no
33923	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, something like that. And then - then we r-	no
33924	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh-huh. O_K.	no
33925	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Ten meetings that have been sent to I_B_M?	no
33926	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And -	no
33927	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33928	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well, I haven't sent them yet because I was having this problem with the  missing files.	no
33929	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Oh.	no
33930	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	O_K.	no
33931	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Oh, that's right, that had - those have  not  been sent.	no
33932	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	H- how many total have we recorded now, altogether?	no
33933	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	We're  saying about  twelve hours.	no
33934	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	About twelve  by now. Twelve or thirteen.	no
33935	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh-huh.	no
33936	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And we're recording only this meeting, like continuously we're only recording this one now? or - ?  O_K.	no
33937	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	No.	no
33938	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Nope.	no
33939	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	No, so the - the - that's the - that's the biggest one - uh, chunk so far,	no
33940	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	It was the morning one.	no
33941	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	O_K.	no
33942	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	but there's at least one meeting recorded of uh the uh uh natural language guys.	no
33943	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Jerry.	no
33944	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Do they meet every week, or  every  -	no
33945	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And then there -	no
33946	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh, they  do.  w- w- And we talked to them about recording some more and we're going to,	no
33947	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh, we've started having a morning meeting, today uh i- starting a w- a week or two ago, on the uh front-end issues, and we're recording those,	no
33948	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh there's a network services and applications group here who's agreed to have their meetings recorded,	no
33949	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Great.	no
33950	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	and we're gonna start recording them. They're - They meet on Tuesdays. We're gonna start recording them next week.	no
33951	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So actually, we're gonna h- start having a - a pretty significant chunk and	no
33952	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	so, you know,  Adam's sort of struggling with trying to get things to be less buggy, and come up quicker when they do crash and stuff - things like that,	no
33953	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	now that uh -  the things are starting to happen.	no
33954	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So right now, yeah, I th- I'd say the data is predominantly meeting meetings,	no
33955	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	but there are scattered other meetings in it and that - that amount is gonna grow uh so that the meeting meetings will probably ultimately -	no
33956	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	i- if we're - if we collect fifty or sixty hours, the meeting meetings it will probably be, you know, twenty or thirty percent of it, not - not - not eighty or ninety. But.	no
33957	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So there's probably - there's three to four a week,	no
33958	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	That's what we're aiming for.	no
33959	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	that we're aiming for.	no
33960	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33961	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And they're each about an hour or something.	no
33962	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, yeah.	no
33963	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Although - Yeah.	no
33964	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	We'll find out tomorrow whether we can really do this or not.	no
33965	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So - O_K.	no
33966	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah and th- the - the other thing is I'm not pos- I'm sort of thinking as we've been through this a few times,	no
33967	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	that I really don't know -	no
33968	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	maybe you wanna do it once for the novelty,	no
33969	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	but I don't know if in general we wanna have meetings that we record from outside this group do the digits.	no
33970	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right.	no
33971	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Because it's just an added bunch of weird stuff. And, you know, we - we h- we're highly motivated.	no
33972	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33973	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh in fact, the  morning  group is  really  motivated cuz they're working on connected digits, so it's -	no
33974	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Actually that's something I wanted to ask, is I have a bunch of scripts to help with the  transcription  of the digits.	yes
33975	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh in fact, the  morning  group is  really  motivated cuz they're working on connected digits, so it's -	no
33976	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Actually that's something I wanted to ask, is I have a bunch of scripts to help with the  transcription  of the digits.	no
33977	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33978	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	We don't have to  hand - transcribe  the digits because we're  reading  them and I  have  those.	no
33979	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right.	no
33980	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
33981	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And so I have some scripts that let you very quickly extract the sections of each utterance. But I haven't been ru- I haven't been  doing  that.	no
33982	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Um, if I  did  that,	no
33983	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	is someone gonna be working on it?	no
33984	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh, yeah, I - I think	no
33985	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I mean, is it something of interest?	no
33986	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	definitely s- so- Absolutely. Yeah, whoever we have working on	no
33987	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	O_K.	no
33988	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Hmm.	no
33989	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	the acoustics for the Meeting Recorder are gonna start with that.	no
33990	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I mean, I-	no
33991	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I'm - I'm  interested  in it, I just don't have  time  to do it  now.	no
33992	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I was - these meetings - I'm sure someone thought of this, but these -	no
33993	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So	no
33994	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	this uh reading of the numbers would be extremely helpful to do um adaptation. Um.	no
33995	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yep.	no
33996	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yep.	no
33997	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Actually I have o-  @@	no
33998	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I - I would really like someone to do adaptation.  So if we got someone interested in that, I think it would be  great  for Meeting Recorder.	no
33999	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
34000	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well -	no
34001	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I mean, one of the things I wanted to do, uh, that I- I talked to -	no
34002	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Since it's the same people over and over.	no
34003	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	to  Don  about, is one of the possible things he could do or m- also, we could have someone else do it,	no
34004	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
34005	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	is to do block echo cancellation,	no
34006	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	to try to get rid of some of the effects of the - the - the far-field effects.	no
34007	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
34008	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Um, I mean we have -	no
34009	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	the party line has been that echo cancellation is not the right way to handle the situation because people move around,	no
34010	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	and uh, if - if it's - if it's uh not a simple echo, like a cross-talk kind of echo, but it's actually room acoustics, it's - it's - it's -	no
34011	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
34012	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	you can't really do inversion, and even echo cancellation is going to uh be something - It may - you -	no
34013	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	"Someone may be moving enough that you are not able to adapt quickly and so the tack that we've taken is more ""lets come up with feature approaches and multi-stream approaches and so forth, that will be  robust  to it for the recognizer and not try to create a clean signal""."	no
34014	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
34015	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh, that's the party line.	no
34016	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	But it occurred to me a few months ago that uh	no
34017	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	party lines are always, you know, sort of dangerous. It's good -	no
34018	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	good to sort of  test  them, actually. And so we haven't had anybody try to do a good serious job on echo cancellation and	no
34019	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	we should  know  how well that can  do.  So	no
34020	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	that's something I'd like somebody to do at some point, just take these digits, take the far-field mike signal, and the close	no
34021	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh mike signal, and apply really good echo cancellation. Um,	no
34022	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Hmm.	no
34023	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	there was a - have been some nice talks recently by - by Lucent on - on their b-	no
34024	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	the  block  echo cancellation particularly appealed to me, uh you know, trying and change it sample by sample, but you have some reasonable sized blocks.	no
34025	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And um,	no
34026	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	you know, th-	no
34027	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	W- what is the um -	no
34028	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Ciao.	no
34029	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	the artifact you try to - you're trying to get rid of when you do that?	no
34030	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh so it's - it - you have a - a direct uh -	no
34031	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh, what's the difference in - If you were trying to construct a linear filter,	no
34032	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	that would um -	no
34033	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I'm signing off.	no
34034	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
34035	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	that would subtract off	no
34036	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	the um	no
34037	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh parts of the signal that were the aspects of the signal that were different between the close-talk and the distant.	no
34038	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	You know, so - so uh	no
34039	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	um	no
34040	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I guess in most echo cancellation -	no
34041	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, so you - Given that um -	no
34042	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, so you're trying to - So you'd - There's a - a distance between the close and the distant mikes so there's a time delay there,	no
34043	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	and after the time delay, there's these various reflections.	no
34044	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And if you figure out well what's the - there's a - a least squares algorithm that adjusts itself - adjusts the weight so that you try to subtract - essentially to subtract off uh different uh - different reflections.	no
34045	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right? So let's take the simple case where you just had -	no
34046	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	you had some uh some delay in a satellite connection or something and then there's a - there's an  echo.  It comes  back.	no
34047	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And you want to adjust this filter so that it will maximally reduce the effect of this echo.	no
34048	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So that would mean like if you were listening to the data that was recorded on one of those.	no
34049	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh, just the raw data, you would - you might hear kind of an echo?	no
34050	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And - and then this - noise cancellation would get-	no
34051	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well, I'm - I'm - I'm saying - That's a simplified version of what's  really  happening.  What's  really  happening is - Well, when I'm talking to you right  now,	no
34052	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	you're getting the direct sound from my speech, but you're also getting,	no
34053	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh, the indirect sound that's bounced around the  room  a number of times.	no
34054	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	O_K?	no
34055	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So now, if you um try to r- you -	no
34056	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	To  completely  remove the effect of that is sort of impractical for a number of technical reasons, but I - but -	no
34057	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	not to try to completely remove it, that is, invert the - the room response, but just	no
34058	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	to try to uh uh eliminate some of the - the effect of some of the echos.	no
34059	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Um, a number of people have done this so that, say, if you're talking to a speakerphone,	no
34060	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh it makes it more like it would be, if you were talking right up to it.	no
34061	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So this is sort of the st- the straight-forward approach.	no
34062	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	You say I - I - I want to	no
34063	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	use  this uh - this item but I want to subtract off various kinds of echos. So you construct a filter,	no
34064	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	and you have this - this  filtered  version uh of the speech	no
34065	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	um gets uh uh - gets subtracted off from the original speech.	no
34066	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Then you try to - you try to minimize the energy in some sense.	no
34067	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And so um -	no
34068	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh with some constraints.	no
34069	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Kind of a  clean  up thing, that - O_K.	no
34070	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	It's a clean up thing. Right. So,	no
34071	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	echo cancelling is - is, you know, commonly done in telephony,	no
34072	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	and - and - and	no
34073	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	it's sort of the obvious thing to do in this situation if you - if, you know,	no
34074	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	you're gonna be talking some distance from a mike.	no
34075	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	When uh,	no
34076	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I would have meetings with the folks in Cambridge when I was at B_B_N over the phone,	no
34077	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	they had a um -	no
34078	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	some kind of a special speaker phone and when they would first connect me,	no
34079	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	it would come on and we'd hear all this noise.	no
34080	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
34081	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And then it was uh - And then it would come on and it was very clear, you know.	no
34082	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right. So it's taking samples, it's doing adaptation, it's adjusting weights, and then it's getting the sum.	no
34083	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So um,	no
34084	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh  anyway  that's - that's kind of a reasonable thing that I'd like to have somebody try - somebody look - And -	no
34085	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	and the digits would be a reasonable thing	no
34086	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	to  do  that with. I think that'd be enough data - plenty of data to do that with, and	no
34087	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	i- for that sort of task you wouldn't care whether it was uh large vocabulary speech or anything. Uh.	no
34088	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Is Brian Kingsbury's work related to that, or is it a different type of reverberation?	no
34089	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Um	no
34090	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Brian's  Kingsbury's work is an example of what we did	no
34091	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	"f- f- from the opposite dogma. Right? Which is what I was calling the ""party line"", which is that"	no
34092	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh doing that sort of thing is not really what we want. We want something more flexible,	no
34093	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh i- i- where people might change their position, and there might be, you know -	no
34094	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	There's also um	no
34095	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	oh yeah,  noise.  So the echo cancellation does not really allow for  noise.	no
34096	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	It's if you have a clean situation but you just have some delays,	no
34097	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Then we'll figure out the right - the right set of weights for your taps for your filter in order to produce the effect of those - those echos.	no
34098	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	But um	no
34099	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	if there's  noise,  then the very signal that it's  looking  at	no
34100	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	is corrupted so that it's decision about what the right -	no
34101	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	you know, right - right uh - delays are - is, uh - is -	no
34102	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	right delayed signal is - is - is - uh is incorrect.	no
34103	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And so, in a  noisy  situation,	no
34104	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	um,  also  in a - in a situation that's very reverberant -  with long reverberation times	no
34105	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	and really long delays, it's - it's sort of typically impractical.	no
34106	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So for those kind of reasons,	no
34107	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	and also a - a c- a complete inversion,  if you actually - I mentioned that it's kind of hard to really do the inversion of the room acoustics.	no
34108	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Um, that's difficult because um	no
34109	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	often times the - the um -	no
34110	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	the system transfer function is such that when it's inverted you get something that's unstable,	no
34111	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	and so, if you - you do your estimate of what the system is, and then you try to invert it, you get a filter that actually uh, you know,	no
34112	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	rings, and - and uh goes to infinity. So it's -	no
34113	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	so there's - there's - there's  that  sort of technical reason, and the fact that things move, and there's air currents -  I mean there's all sorts of -	no
34114	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	all sorts of reasons why it's not really practical. So for all those kinds of reasons, uh we - we - we sort of	no
34115	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	um, concluded we didn't want to in- do inversion, and we're even pretty skeptical of echo cancellation, which isn't really inversion,	no
34116	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	and um we decided to do this approach of taking - uh, just picking	no
34117	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh features, which were -	no
34118	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh will give you more - something that was more stable, in the presence of, or absence of, room reverberation, and that's what Brian was trying to do.	no
34119	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So, um, let me just say a couple things that I was - I was gonna	no
34120	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	bring up. Uh.	no
34121	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Let's see. I guess you - you actually already said this thing about the uh - about the consent forms,	no
34122	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	which was that we now don't have to -	no
34123	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So this was the human subjects folks who said this,  or that - that - ?	no
34124	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	The a- apparently - I mean, we're gonna do a revised form, of course. Um	no
34125	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	but once a person has signed it once, then that's	no
34126	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	valid for a certain number of meetings.  She  wanted me to actually estimate how many meetings and put that on the consent form.	no
34127	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I told her that would be a little bit difficult to  say.  So I think	no
34128	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	from a s- practical standpoint, maybe we could have  them   do it once every ten meetings, or something. It won't be that many people who do it  that often, but um just, you know, so long as they don't forget that they've done it, I guess.	no
34129	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	O_K.	yes
34130	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	O_K.	no
34131	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Um, back on the  data  thing, so there's this sort of one hour, ten hour, a hundred hour sort of thing that - that we have.	no
34132	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	We have - we have an hour	no
34133	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh that - that is transcribed, we have - we have twelve hours that's recorded but not transcribed,	no
34134	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	and at the rate we're going, uh by the end of the semester we'll have, I don't know, forty or fifty or something, if we - if this really uh -	no
34135	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well, do we have that much? Let's see, we have -	no
34136	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Not really. It's three to four per week.	no
34137	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So that's what - You know, that -	no
34138	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh eight weeks, uh is -	no
34139	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So that's not a lot of hours. Um -	no
34140	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Eight weeks times three hours is twenty-four, so that's - Yeah, so like thirty -	no
34141	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Three -	no
34142	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Three hours.	no
34143	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
34144	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	thirty hours?	no
34145	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I mean, is there - I know this sounds  tough but we've got the room set up. Um	no
34146	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I was starting to think of some projects where you would use	no
34147	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	well, similar to what we talked about with uh	no
34148	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	energy detection on the close-talking mikes. There are a number of	no
34149	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	interesting questions that you can ask about how interactions happen in a meeting, that don't require any transcription. So what are the patterns, the energy patterns over the meeting?	no
34150	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
34151	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And I'm really interested in this	no
34152	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	but we don't have	no
34153	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	a whole lot of data. So I was thinking, you know, we've got the room set up	no
34154	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	and you can always think of, also for political reasons, if ICSI collected	no
34155	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	you know,  two  hundred hours, that looks different than  forty  hours, even if we don't transcribe it ourselves,  so -	no
34156	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	But I don't think we're gonna stop at the end of this semester.	no
34157	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right? So, I th- I think that if we are able to keep that up	no
34158	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	for a few months, we  are  gonna have more like a hundred hours.	no
34159	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I mean, is there - Are there any other meetings here that we can	no
34160	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	record,  especially  meetings that have some kind of conflict in them  or some kind of deci-	no
34161	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I mean, that are less well - I don't -	no
34162	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh, that have some more emotional aspects to them, or strong -	no
34163	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	We had some  good  ones  earlier.	no
34164	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	There's laughter, um I'm talking more about strong differences of opinion meetings, maybe with manager types, or -	no
34165	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I think it's hard to  record  those.	no
34166	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	To be  allowed  to record them? O_K.	no
34167	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
34168	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, people will get -	no
34169	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	It's also likely that people will cancel out afterwards. But I - but I wanted to raise the K_P_F_A idea.	no
34170	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	O_K. Well,  if  there is, anyway.	no
34171	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, I was gonna mention that.	no
34172	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Oh,  that's  a good idea. That's - That would be a good  match.	no
34173	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
34174	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah. So - Yeah. So I - I - uh, I - I'd mentioned to Adam, and -	no
34175	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	that was another thing I was gonna talk - uh, mention to them before -	no
34176	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	that uh there's uh - It - it oc- it occurred to me that we might be able to get some additional data	no
34177	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	by talking to uh acquaintances in local broadcast media.	no
34178	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Because, you know, we had talked before about the problem about using found data,	no
34179	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	that - that uh it's just set up however they have it set up and we don't have any say about it and it's typically one microphone,	no
34180	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
34181	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	in a, uh, uh - or - and - and so it doesn't  really  give us the - the - the uh characteristics we want.	no
34182	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
34183	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Um and so I do think we're gonna continue recording here and record what we  can.	no
34184	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	"But um, it  did  occur to me that we could go to friends in broadcast media and say ""hey you have this panel show,  or this - you know, this discussion show, and um can you record multi-channel?"""	no
34185	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And uh they may be willing	no
34186	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	to record it uh with -	no
34187	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	With lapel mikes or something?	no
34188	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well, they probably already use lapel, but they might be able to have it - it wouldn't be that weird for them to have another mike that was somewhat distant. It wouldn't be exactly this setup,	no
34189	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right.	no
34190	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	but it would be that sort of thing,	no
34191	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Hunh.	no
34192	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	and what we were gonna get from U_W, you know, assuming they - they - they start recording, isn't -	no
34193	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	als-   also  is not going to be this exact setup.	no
34194	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right. No, I think that'd be  great,	no
34195	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So,	no
34196	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	if we can get more data.	no
34197	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I - I - I - I was thinking of looking into that.	no
34198	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	the  other  thing that occurred to me  after  we had that discussion, in fact, is that it's  even   possible,  since of course, many	no
34199	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	radio shows are not live,	no
34200	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh that we could invite them to have	no
34201	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	like some of their -  record some of their shows  here.	no
34202	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Hmm!	no
34203	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Wow!	no
34204	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well - Or - The thing is, they're not as averse to wearing one of these head-mount- I mean, they're on the  radio,  right? So.	no
34205	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right, as we are.	no
34206	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right.	no
34207	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Um, I think that'd be fantastic cuz those kinds of panels and -  Those  have interesting	no
34208	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
34209	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Th- that's an - a side of style - a style that we're not collecting  here,  so  it'd be great.	no
34210	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And - and the - I mean, the other side to it was the - what -	no
34211	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	which is where we were  coming  from - I'll -	no
34212	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I'll talk to you more about it  later   is that - is that there's - there's uh	no
34213	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	the radio stations and television stations already have stuff worked out	no
34214	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	presumably,	no
34215	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh related to, you know, legal issues and - and permissions and all that. I mean, they already do what they do - do whatever they do. So it's -	no
34216	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
34217	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh, it's - So it's - so it's another source. So I think	no
34218	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	it's something we should look into, you know, we'll collect what we collect here hopefully they will collect more at U_W also	no
34219	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	and um - and maybe we have this other source. But yeah I think that it's not unreasonable to aim at	no
34220	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	getting, you know, significantly in excess of a hundred hours. I mean, that was sort of our goal.	no
34221	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
34222	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	The thing was, I was  hoping  that we could -	no
34223	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	@@	no
34224	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	in the - under this controlled situation we could at  least  collect, you know, thirty to fifty hours.	no
34225	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And at the rate we're going we'll get pretty  close  to that I think this semester.	no
34226	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And if we continue to collect some next semester, I think we should,	no
34227	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh -	no
34228	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	"Right. Yeah I was mostly trying to think, ""O_K, if you start a project,"	no
34229	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	within say a month, you know, how much data do you have to work with. And you - you wanna s- you wanna sort of fr-  freeze  your - your data for  awhile	no
34230	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	so um	no
34231	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	right  now  - and we don't have the transcripts back yet from I_B_M right?	no
34232	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well, we don't even have it for this f- you know, forty-five minutes, that was -	no
34233	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Do -	no
34234	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Oh, do we now? So um, not  complaining,  I was just trying to think, you know, what kinds of projects can you do now versus uh six months from now and they're pretty different, because  um -	no
34235	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
34236	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right.	no
34237	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah. So I was thinking right now it's sort of this exploratory stuff where you - you look at the data, you use some primitive measures and get a feeling for what the scatter plots look like, and -	no
34238	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right.	no
34239	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right, right.	no
34240	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	and - and uh - and meanwhile we collect, and it's more like yeah, three months from now, or six months from now you can - you can do a lot of other things.	no
34241	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Cuz I'm not actually sure, just logistically that I can spend - you know, I don't wanna charge the time that I have on the project too early, before there's enough data to make	no
34242	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	good use of the time. And that's - and especially with the student	no
34243	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right.	no
34244	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh for instance this guy who seems -	no
34245	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
34246	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh anyway, I shouldn't say too much, but um if someone came that was great and wanted to do some real work and they have to end by the end of this school year in the spring, how much data will I	no
34247	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	have to work with, with that person. And so it's -	no
34248	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right.	no
34249	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	i- Yeah, so I would think, exploratory things now.	no
34250	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh, three months from now -	no
34251	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Um, I mean the transcriptions I think are a bit of an unknown cuz we haven't gotten those back yet as far as the timing,	no
34252	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	but I think as far as the collection, it doesn't seem to me l- like,	no
34253	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh, unreasonable to say that	no
34254	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh in	no
34255	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	January, you know, ro- roughly uh - which is roughly three months from now,	no
34256	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Hmm.	no
34257	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	we  should  have at least something like, you know, twenty-five, thirty  hours.	no
34258	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	@@	no
34259	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And we just don't know about the  transcription  part of that, so. I mean, it -	no
34260	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So that's -	no
34261	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, we need to - I think that there's a possibility that the transcript will need to be adjusted afterwards, and uh	no
34262	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yep.	no
34263	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	es-  especially  since these people won't be	no
34264	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right.	no
34265	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
34266	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh  used  to dealing with multi-channel uh transcriptions. So I think that we'll need to adjust some - And also if we wanna add things like	no
34267	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right.	no
34268	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	um, well, more refined coding of overlaps, then definitely I think we should count on having an extra pass through.	no
34269	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I wanted to ask another a- a- aspect of the data collection.  There'd be no reason why a person couldn't get together several uh, you know, friends, and come and argue about a topic if they wanted to, right?	no
34270	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	If they really have something they wanna talk about as opposed to something  @@  - I mean,	no
34271	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	what we're trying to stay away from was artificial constructions, but I think if it's a real -	no
34272	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Why  not?   Yeah.	no
34273	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I mean, I'm thinking, politically -	no
34274	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Stage some political debates.	no
34275	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	You could  do  this, you know. You  could.	no
34276	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well  yeah,  or just if you're -	no
34277	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	if you ha- If there are meetings here that happen that we can record even if we don't  um have them do the digits,  or maybe have them do a  shorter   digit thing  like if it was, you know,	no
34278	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	We don't have to do the digits at  all  if we don't  want  to.	no
34279	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh,  one  string of digits, or something, they'd probably be willing to do.	no
34280	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Then, having the data is very valuable, cuz I think it's	no
34281	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	um	no
34282	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	politically  better for us to say we have this many hours of audio data,  especially  with the I_T_R, if we put in a proposal on it. It'll just look like ICSI's collected a lot more	no
34283	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	audio  data. Um, whether it's transcribed or not	no
34284	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	um, is another issue, but there's -	no
34285	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	there are research	no
34286	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	questions you can answer without the transcriptions, or at least that you can  start  to answer.	no
34287	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	It seems like  you  could hold some  meetings.  You know, you and maybe Adam? You - you could - you could maybe hold some additional meetings, if you wanted.	no
34288	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yep.	no
34289	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So.	no
34290	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Would it help at all - I mean, we're already talking about sort of two	no
34291	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	levels of detail in meetings. One is uh	no
34292	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	um	no
34293	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	without doing the digits -	no
34294	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Or, I guess the  full-blown  one is where you do the digits, and everything, and then talk about doing it  without  digits, what if we had  another  level, just to collect data, which is without the headsets and we just did the table-mounted stuff.	no
34295	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Need  the close-talking mikes.	no
34296	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	You do, O_K.	no
34297	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I mean, absolutely, yeah. I'm really scared -	no
34298	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah. Yeah.	no
34299	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	It seems like it's a big part of this corpus is to have the close-talking mikes.	no
34300	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Um or at least, like, me personally? I would -  I - couldn't use that data.	no
34301	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I see, O_K.	no
34302	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
34303	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I agree. And Mari also, we had - This came up when she- she was here. That's important.	no
34304	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Um.	no
34305	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, I - I -	no
34306	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So it's a great idea, and if it were  true  than I would just do that, but it's not that bad - like the room is not the bottleneck, and we have enough time in the room, it's getting the people to come in and put on the - and get the setup going.	no
34307	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	b- By the -	no
34308	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	by the way, I don't think the transcriptions are  actually,  in the  long  run, such a big bottleneck. I think the issue is just that we're - we're blazing that	no
34309	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	path. Right? And - and um -	no
34310	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	d- Do you have any idea when - when uh the - you'll be able to send uh the ten hours to them?	no
34311	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well, I've been burning two C_Ds a day, which is about all I can do with the time I have. So it'll be early next week.	no
34312	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
34313	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
34314	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, O_K. So early next week we send it to them, and then - then we check with them to see if they've got it and we - we start, you know	no
34315	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yep.	no
34316	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	asking about the timing for it. So I think once  they  get	no
34317	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	it sorted out about how  they're  gonna do it, which I think they're pretty well along on, cuz they were able to read the files and so on. Right?	no
34318	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yep.	no
34319	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, but -	no
34320	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well -	no
34321	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, who knows where they are.	no
34322	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Have they ever responded to you?	no
34323	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Nope.	no
34324	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Hhh.	no
34325	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, but -	no
34326	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	You know, so they - they - they have -	no
34327	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	What if -	no
34328	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	you know, they're volunteering their time and they have a lot of other things to do, right? But they -	no
34329	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, you - we can't complain.	no
34330	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
34331	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	But at any rate, they'll - I - I think	no
34332	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	once they get that sorted out, they're - they're making cassettes there, then they're handing it to someone who they - who's - who	no
34333	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	is doing it, and uh	no
34334	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I think	no
34335	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	it's not going to be - I don't think it's going to be  that  much more of a deal for them to do thirty hours then to do  one  hour, I think. It's not going to be thirty t-	no
34336	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yep. I think that's probably true.	no
34337	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Really?	no
34338	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So it's the amount of -	no
34339	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	It's - it's just getting it  going.	no
34340	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	It's pipeline, pipeline issues. Once the pipeline fills.	no
34341	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right. What about these lunch meetings - I mean, I don't know, if there's any way without too much more overhead, even if we don't ship it right away to I_B_M even if we just collect it here for awhile,  to record	no
34342	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	you know, two or three more meeting a week, just to have the data, even if they're	no
34343	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	um not doing the digits, but they do wear the headphones?	no
34344	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	But the lunch meetings are pretty much one person getting up and -	no
34345	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	No, I meant, um, sorry, the meetings where people eat their lunch	no
34346	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	downstairs, maybe they don't wanna be recorded, but -	no
34347	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Oh, and we're just chatting?	no
34348	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Just the ch- the  chatting.  I actually -	no
34349	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, we have a lot of those.	no
34350	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I actually think that's  useful  data, um  the chatting, but -	no
34351	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, the problem with that is I would - I think I would feel a little constrained to - You know?	no
34352	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	O_K.	no
34353	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	You don't wanna do it, cuz -	no
34354	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	O_K.	no
34355	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	"Uh, some of the meetings - You know, our ""soccer ball"" meeting? I guess none of you were there for our soccer ball meeting."	no
34356	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Alright.	no
34357	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Alright,  so I'll just throw it out there, if anyone knows of one more m- or two more wee- meetings per week that happen at ICSI, um	no
34358	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	That was hilarious.	no
34359	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	that we could record, I think it would be worth it.	no
34360	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah. Well, we should also check with Mari again, because they -	no
34361	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	because they were really  intending,	no
34362	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	you know, maybe just	no
34363	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	didn't  happen,  but they were really intending to be duplicating this	no
34364	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	in some level. So then that would double  what we had.	no
34365	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	O_K.	no
34366	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right.	no
34367	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh.	no
34368	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And there's a lot of different meetings at U_W uh -	no
34369	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I mean really m- a lot more  than we have here right cuz we're not right on campus, so.	no
34370	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right.	no
34371	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Is the uh, notion of recording any of Chuck's meetings dead in the water, or is that still a possibility?	no
34372	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Uh,  they seem to have some problems with it. We can - we can talk about that later.	no
34373	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Um, but, again, Jerry is - Jerry's open - So I mean, we have	no
34374	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	two speech meetings, one uh network meeting,	no
34375	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh Jerry was open to it but I - I s-	no
34376	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	One of the things that I think is a little - a  little  bit of a limitation, there is a think when the people are  not  involved uh in our work,	no
34377	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	we probably can't do it every week.	no
34378	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	You know? I - I - I - I think that - that people are gonna feel uh -	no
34379	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	are  gonna feel a little bit constrained.	no
34380	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Now, it  might  get a little better if we don't have them do the digits all the time. And the - then - so then they can just really sort of try to - put the mikes on and then just charge in and - and -	no
34381	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yep.	no
34382	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	What if we	no
34383	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	give people - you know, we cater a lunch in exchange for them having their meeting here or something?	no
34384	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well, you know, I - I  do  think eating while you're  doing   a meeting is going to be increasing the noise. But I had another question, which is um, you know, in principle,	no
34385	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	O_K.  Alright, alright, alright.	no
34386	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	w- um, I know that you don't want	no
34387	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	artificial topics, but	no
34388	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	um	no
34389	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	it  does  seem to me that we might be able to get subjects from campus to come down and	no
34390	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	do  something  that wouldn't be too artificial. I mean, we could - political discussions, or - or  something  or other, and	no
34391	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	No ,  definitely.	no
34392	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	i- you know, people who are - Because, you know, there's also this  constraint.  We d- it's like, you know, the - the - uh goldibears - goldi- goldilocks, it's like you don't want meetings that are too large, but you don't want meetings that are too small. And um -	no
34393	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	a- and it just seems like maybe we could exploit the subj- human subject p- p- pool, in the positive sense of the word.	no
34394	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well, even - I mean, coming down from campus is sort of a big thing, but what about	no
34395	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	We could pay subjects.	no
34396	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	or what about people in the - in the building?	no
34397	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah, I was thinking, there's all these other peo- Yeah.	no
34398	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I mean, there's the State of California	no
34399	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	downstairs, and -	no
34400	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I mean -	no
34401	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I just really doubt that uh any of the State of California meetings would be recordable and then releasable to the general public.	no
34402	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
34403	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Oh.	no
34404	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
34405	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So I - I mean I talked with some people at the Haas Business School who are i- who are interested in speech recognition	no
34406	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Alright, well.	no
34407	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	"and, they sort of hummed and hawed and said ""well maybe we could have meetings down here"", but then I got email from them that said ""no,"	no
34408	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	"we decided we're not really interested and we don't wanna come down and hold meetings."""	no
34409	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So, I think it's gonna be a problem to get people regularly.	no
34410	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	What about Joachim, maybe he can -	no
34411	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	But - but we c- But I think, you know, we get some scattered things from this and that. And I - I d- I  do  think that	no
34412	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	maybe we can get somewhere with the - with the radio. Uh i- I have better contacts in radio than in television, but -	no
34413	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
34414	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	You could get a lot of lively discussions from those  radio  ones.	no
34415	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yep.	no
34416	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well, and they're already - they're - these things are already recorded, we don't have to ask them to - even - and I'm not sure wh-  how  they record it, but they  must  record from individual -	no
34417	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
34418	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
34419	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	n- Well -	no
34420	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	No, I'm not talking about ones that are already recorded.	no
34421	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	I'm talking about  new  ones because - because - because we would be asking them to do something  different.	no
34422	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Why - why not?	no
34423	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Well, we can find out. I know for instance  Mark  Liberman was interested uh in - in L_D_C getting  data, uh, and -	no
34424	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right, that's the found data idea. But what I'm saying is uh if I talk to people that I know who  do  these th- who  produce  these things we could ask them if they could record an extra channel,	no
34425	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Yeah.	no
34426	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	let's say, of a distant  mike.	no
34427	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
34428	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	And u- I think  routinely  they would not  do  this.	no
34429	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	So, since I'm interested in the distant  mike  stuff, I wanna make sure that there is at least  that   somewhere	no
34430	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Right.  Great . O_K.	no
34431	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	and uh - But if we ask them to  do  that they might be  intrigued  enough by the idea that they	no
34432	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	uh might be e- e- willing to - the - I might be able to talk them into it.	no
34433	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Mm-hmm.	no
34434	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Um. We're getting towards the end of our disk space, so we should think about trying to wrap up here.	no
34435	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	O_K. Well I don't - why don't we - why d- u- why don't we uh uh turn them - turn the -	no
34436	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	That's a good way to end a meeting.	no
34437	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	O_K, leave - leave them on for a moment until I turn this off, cuz that's when it crashed last time.	no
34438	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Oh.	no
34439	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	That's good to know.	no
34440	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	Turning off the microphone made it crash. Well -	no
34441	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	That's good to know.	no
34442	transcript	transcript_Bmr005	O_K.	yes
34443	transcript	transcript_Bed011	@@	no

34466	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah, let's get started.	no
34467	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Um -	no
34468	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Hopefully Nancy will come, if not, she won't.	no
34469	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Uh, Robert, do you uh	no
34470	transcript	transcript_Bed011	have any way to turn off your uh	no
34471	transcript	transcript_Bed011	screensaver on there so that it's not going off every - uh, it seems to have about at two minute -	no
34472	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah, I've - I - uh - it's not that I didn't try.	no
34473	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K.	no
34474	transcript	transcript_Bed011	and um I - I told it to stay on forever and ever, but if it's not plugged in it just doesn't obey my commands.	no
34475	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K.	no
34476	transcript	transcript_Bed011	It has a mind.	no
34477	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Got it.	no
34478	transcript	transcript_Bed011	But I-	no
34479	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Wants to conserve.	no
34480	transcript	transcript_Bed011	I just - You know, sort of keep on wiggling.	no
34481	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah, O_K.	no
34482	transcript	transcript_Bed011	But uh - we'll just be m- m- working on it at intensity so it doesn't happen.	yes
34483	transcript	transcript_Bed011	But uh - we'll just be m- m- working on it at intensity so it doesn't happen.	no
34484	transcript	transcript_Bed011	We'll see.	no
34485	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Should we plunge right into it?	no
34486	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
34487	transcript	transcript_Bed011	So, would you like to -	no
34488	transcript	transcript_Bed011	I think so.	no
34489	transcript	transcript_Bed011	So what I've tried to do here is	no
34490	transcript	transcript_Bed011	list all the decision nodes that we have identified on this  side.	no
34491	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Commented and -	no
34492	transcript	transcript_Bed011	what they're about and sort of -	no
34493	transcript	transcript_Bed011	the properties we may	no
34494	transcript	transcript_Bed011	um	no
34495	transcript	transcript_Bed011	give them.	no
34496	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And here are the uh -	no
34497	transcript	transcript_Bed011	tasks to be implemented via our data collection. So all of these tasks -	no
34498	transcript	transcript_Bed011	The reading is out of these tasks	no
34499	transcript	transcript_Bed011	more or less imply that the user wants to go there,	no
34500	transcript	transcript_Bed011	sometime or the other.	no
34501	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And analogously	no
34502	transcript	transcript_Bed011	for example, here we have	no
34503	transcript	transcript_Bed011	our	no
34504	transcript	transcript_Bed011	EVA	no
34505	transcript	transcript_Bed011	um - intention.	no
34506	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And these are the	no
34507	transcript	transcript_Bed011	data tasks where w-	no
34508	transcript	transcript_Bed011	we can assume the person would like to enter, view or just approach	no
34509	transcript	transcript_Bed011	the thing. Analogously	no
34510	transcript	transcript_Bed011	the same on the object information	no
34511	transcript	transcript_Bed011	we can see that, you know, we have sort of	no
34512	transcript	transcript_Bed011	created these tasks before we came up with our decision nodes so there's a lot of things where we have no analogous	no
34513	transcript	transcript_Bed011	tasks, and  that may or may not be a problem. We can change the tasks slightly if we feel that we should have data for e- sort of for every	no
34514	transcript	transcript_Bed011	decision node so - trying to im-	no
34515	transcript	transcript_Bed011	um -	no
34516	transcript	transcript_Bed011	implant the intention of going to a place now, going to a place later on the same tour, or trying to plant the intention of going sometime	no
34517	transcript	transcript_Bed011	on the next tour, or the next day or whenever.	no
34518	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Right, right.	no
34519	transcript	transcript_Bed011	But I think that might be overdoing it a little.	no
34520	transcript	transcript_Bed011	So -	yes
34521	transcript	transcript_Bed011	But I think that might be overdoing it a little.	no
34522	transcript	transcript_Bed011	So -	no
34523	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah. So let me pop up a level.	no
34524	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And uh	no
34525	transcript	transcript_Bed011	s- s- make sure that we're all oriented	no
34526	transcript	transcript_Bed011	the same. So	no
34527	transcript	transcript_Bed011	What we're gonna do today is two related things.	no
34528	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Uh one of them is to work on	no
34529	transcript	transcript_Bed011	the semantics of the belief-net which is going to be the main inference engine for thi- the system	no
34530	transcript	transcript_Bed011	uh making decisions. And decisions are going to turn out to be	no
34531	transcript	transcript_Bed011	parameter choices for calls on other modules.	no
34532	transcript	transcript_Bed011	so f- the natural language understanding thing	no
34533	transcript	transcript_Bed011	is uh, we think	no
34534	transcript	transcript_Bed011	gonna only have to choose parameters, but	no
34535	transcript	transcript_Bed011	You know, a fairly large set of parameters. So to do that, we need to do two things. One of which is figure out what all the choices are, which we've done a fair amount.	no
34536	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Then we need to figure out what influences its choices and finally we have to do some technical work on	no
34537	transcript	transcript_Bed011	the actual belief relations and	no
34538	transcript	transcript_Bed011	presumably estimates of the probabilities and stuff. But we aren't gonna do the probability stuff today.	no
34539	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Technical stuff we'll do -	no
34540	transcript	transcript_Bed011	uh -	no
34541	transcript	transcript_Bed011	another day. Probably next week.	no
34542	transcript	transcript_Bed011	But we are gonna worry about	no
34543	transcript	transcript_Bed011	all the decisions and the things that pert- that contribute to them. And	no
34544	transcript	transcript_Bed011	we're also, sort of uh in the same process,	no
34545	transcript	transcript_Bed011	going to work with Fey on	no
34546	transcript	transcript_Bed011	what there should be in the dialogues. So	no
34547	transcript	transcript_Bed011	One of the s- steps that's coming up real soon is to actually get subjects	no
34548	transcript	transcript_Bed011	uh - in here, and have them	no
34549	transcript	transcript_Bed011	actually record like this.	no
34550	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Uh record dialogues more or less.	no
34551	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And -	no
34552	transcript	transcript_Bed011	depending on	no
34553	transcript	transcript_Bed011	what Fey sort of provokes them to say, we'll get information on different things.	no
34554	transcript	transcript_Bed011	So -	no
34555	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Well how people phrase different intentions more or less, huh?	no
34556	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Fo- v- yeah- people with the - phrase them and so -	no
34557	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Uh for, you know, Keith and people worrying about what constructions people use,	no
34558	transcript	transcript_Bed011	uh - we have some i- we have some ways to	no
34559	transcript	transcript_Bed011	affect that by the way the dialogues go.	no
34560	transcript	transcript_Bed011	So what Robert kindly did, is to lay out	no
34561	transcript	transcript_Bed011	a table of the kinds of uh  things that - that might come up,	no
34562	transcript	transcript_Bed011	and,	no
34563	transcript	transcript_Bed011	the kinds of decisions. So the uh -	no
34564	transcript	transcript_Bed011	uh - on the left are decision nodes,	no
34565	transcript	transcript_Bed011	and	no
34566	transcript	transcript_Bed011	discreet values. So if - if we're right,	no
34567	transcript	transcript_Bed011	you can get by with	no
34568	transcript	transcript_Bed011	um	no
34569	transcript	transcript_Bed011	just this middle column worth of decisions, and it's not all that many, and it's perfectly feasible technically to build belief-nets	no
34570	transcript	transcript_Bed011	that will do that. And he has a handout.	no
34571	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah. Maybe it was too fast plunging in there, because	no
34572	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
34573	transcript	transcript_Bed011	j- we have two updates. Um you can look at  this  if you want, these are	no
34574	transcript	transcript_Bed011	what our subject's going to have to fill out. Any comments I can - can still be made and the changes will be put in  correspondingly.	no
34575	transcript	transcript_Bed011	m-	no
34576	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Let me summarize in two sentences, mainly for Eva's benefit, who probably has not heard about the data collection, at all. Or have you heard about it?	no
34577	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K.	no
34578	transcript	transcript_Bed011	No.	no
34579	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Not that much  you didn't .	no
34580	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K. We were gonna put this in front of people. They give us some information on themselves.	no
34581	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Then - then they will read uh - a task where lots of German words are sort of thrown in between.	no
34582	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K.	no
34583	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And um - and they have to read isolated proper names	no
34584	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And these change -	no
34585	transcript	transcript_Bed011	S-	no
34586	transcript	transcript_Bed011	I don't see a release	no
34587	transcript	transcript_Bed011	No, this is not the release form. This is the speaker	no
34588	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Got it. O_K, fine. O_K.	no
34589	transcript	transcript_Bed011	information form. The release form is over there in that box.	no
34590	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Alright, fair enough.	no
34591	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And um -	no
34592	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And then they gonna have to f-	no
34593	transcript	transcript_Bed011	um	no
34594	transcript	transcript_Bed011	um	no
34595	transcript	transcript_Bed011	choose from one of these tasks, which are listed here. They - they pick a couple, say three - uh - uh six as a matter of fact.	no
34596	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Six different things they sort of think they would do if they were in Heidelberg or traveling someplace -	no
34597	transcript	transcript_Bed011	and um -	no
34598	transcript	transcript_Bed011	and they have a map.	no
34599	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Hmm.	no
34600	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Like this. Very sketchy, simplified map.	no
34601	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And they can take notes on that map.	no
34602	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And then they call this computer system that works perfectly, and understands everything.	no
34603	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K.	no
34604	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And um -	no
34605	transcript	transcript_Bed011	This is a fictional system obviously, huh.	no
34606	transcript	transcript_Bed011	The comp-	no
34607	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah, the computer system sits right in front of you, that's Fey.	no
34608	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yes. I've - I understand everything. Yes I do.	no
34609	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And she does know everything.	no
34610	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"And she has a way of making this machine talk. So she can copy sentences into a window, or type really fast and this machine will use speech synthesis to produce that. So if you ask ""How do I get to the castle"" then a m- s- several seconds later it'll come out of here ""In order to get to the castle you do -""  O_K?"	no
34611	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
34612	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And um -	no
34613	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And then after three tasks the system breaks down.	no
34614	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And Fey comes on the phone as a human operator.	no
34615	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"And says ""Sorry the system broke down but let's continue."" And we sort of get the idea what"	no
34616	transcript	transcript_Bed011	people do when they s- think they speak to a machine and what people say when they think they speak to a human,	no
34617	transcript	transcript_Bed011	or know, or assume they speak to a human.	no
34618	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K.	no
34619	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Huh.	no
34620	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.	no
34621	transcript	transcript_Bed011	That's the data collection.	no
34622	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And um -	no
34623	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And Fey has some thirty subjects lined up? Something?	no
34624	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah. And more and more every day.	no
34625	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And um -	no
34626	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And they're - r-	no
34627	transcript	transcript_Bed011	ready uh - to roll. And we're gonna start tomorrow at three? four? one?	no
34628	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Tomorrow, well we don't know for sure. Because we don't know whether that person is coming or not, but -	no
34629	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K. Around four-ish.	no
34630	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And um we're still l- looking for a room on the sixth floor because they stole away that conference room.	no
34631	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Um - behind our backs. But -	no
34632	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Well, there are these - uh - uh - oh, I see, we have to - Yeah, it's tricky. We'll - let's - let - we'll do that off-line, O_K.	no
34633	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah, but I - i- i- it's happening. David and - and Jane and - and Lila are working on that as we speak.	no
34634	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K.	no
34635	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K.	no
34636	transcript	transcript_Bed011	That was the uh -	no
34637	transcript	transcript_Bed011	the data collection in a nutshell.	no
34638	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And um -	no
34639	transcript	transcript_Bed011	I can report a - so I did this but I also tried to do	no
34640	transcript	transcript_Bed011	this - so if I click on here, Isn't this wonderful?	no
34641	transcript	transcript_Bed011	we get to the uh -	no
34642	transcript	transcript_Bed011	uh belief-net just focusing on - on the g-	no
34643	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Go-there node. uh - Analogously this would be sort of the reason node and the timing node and so forth. And what w-	no
34644	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Mm-hmm.	no
34645	transcript	transcript_Bed011	what happened is that	no
34646	transcript	transcript_Bed011	um	no
34647	transcript	transcript_Bed011	design-wise I'd sort of n- noticed that we can -	no
34648	transcript	transcript_Bed011	we still get a lot of	no
34649	transcript	transcript_Bed011	errors from a lot of points to one of these sub Go-there User Go-there Situation nodes.	no
34650	transcript	transcript_Bed011	So I came up with a couple of additional nodes here where um whether the user is thrifty or not, and what his budget is currently like, is going to result in some financial state of the user. How much will he - is he willing to spend?	no
34651	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Or can spend. Being the same at this - just the money available, which may influence us, whether he wants to go there if it is - you know - charging	no
34652	transcript	transcript_Bed011	tons of dollars for admission or its gonna g- cost a lot of t- e-	no
34653	transcript	transcript_Bed011	whatever. Twenty-two million to fly to	no
34654	transcript	transcript_Bed011	International Space Station, you know.	no
34655	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Right.	no
34656	transcript	transcript_Bed011	just -	no
34657	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Not all people can do that.	no
34658	transcript	transcript_Bed011	So, and this actually turned out to be	no
34659	transcript	transcript_Bed011	pretty key, because	no
34660	transcript	transcript_Bed011	having specified sort of these - uh - this - this - intermediate level	no
34661	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Um	no
34662	transcript	transcript_Bed011	and sort of noticing that	no
34663	transcript	transcript_Bed011	everything that  happens   here - let's go to our	no
34664	transcript	transcript_Bed011	favorite endpoint one	no
34665	transcript	transcript_Bed011	is again	no
34666	transcript	transcript_Bed011	more or less - we have - um - then the situation	no
34667	transcript	transcript_Bed011	nodes contributing to the - the endpoint situation node, which contributes to the endpoint and so forth.	no
34668	transcript	transcript_Bed011	um - I can now sort of draw straight lines from these to here, meaning it	no
34669	transcript	transcript_Bed011	g- of course goes where the sub-S_ -	no
34670	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"everything that comes from situation, everything that comes from user goes with the sub-U_, and whatever we specify for the so-called ""Keith node"", or the discourse, what comes from the - um -"	no
34671	transcript	transcript_Bed011	parser, construction parser, um will contribute to the D_ and the ontology to the sub-O_ node.	no
34672	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And um	no
34673	transcript	transcript_Bed011	one just s- sort of has to watch which -	no
34674	transcript	transcript_Bed011	also final decision node so it doesn't make sense -	no
34675	transcript	transcript_Bed011	t- to figure out whether he wants to enter, view or approach an object if he never wants to go there in the first place.	no
34676	transcript	transcript_Bed011	But this makes the design thing fairly simple.	no
34677	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And um	no
34678	transcript	transcript_Bed011	now all w- that's left to do then is the C_P_G's, the conditional probabilities, for the likelihood of a person having enough money, actually wanting to go a place if it costs, you know this or that.	no
34679	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And um -	no
34680	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K.	no
34681	transcript	transcript_Bed011	and once um Bhaskara has finished his classwork that's where we're gonna end up doing. You get involved in that process too.	no
34682	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And um -	no
34683	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And for now uh-	no
34684	transcript	transcript_Bed011	the - the question	no
34685	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"is ""How much of these decisions do we want to build in explicitly into our"	no
34686	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"data collection?"""	no
34687	transcript	transcript_Bed011	So -	no
34688	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Um, one could -	no
34689	transcript	transcript_Bed011	sort of - think of -	no
34690	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"you know we could call the z- see or - you know, people who visit the zoo we could s- call it ""Visit the zoo tomorrow"", so we have"	no
34691	transcript	transcript_Bed011	an intention of seeing something, but not now - but later.	no
34692	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Right.	no
34693	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah. Yeah, so -	no
34694	transcript	transcript_Bed011	let's s- uh- s-	no
34695	transcript	transcript_Bed011	see I th- I think that	no
34696	transcript	transcript_Bed011	from	no
34697	transcript	transcript_Bed011	one point of view,	no
34698	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Uh, um, all these places are the same, so that d- d-	no
34699	transcript	transcript_Bed011	That, um -	no
34700	transcript	transcript_Bed011	in terms of the linguistics and stuff,	no
34701	transcript	transcript_Bed011	there may be a few different kinds of places, so	no
34702	transcript	transcript_Bed011	I th- i- it seems to me that	no
34703	transcript	transcript_Bed011	We ought to decide	no
34704	transcript	transcript_Bed011	you know, what things are k- are actually going to matter to us.	no
34705	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And um, so the zoo, and the university and the castle, et cetera.	no
34706	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Um are all big-ish things that	no
34707	transcript	transcript_Bed011	um - you know - have different parts to them, and one of them might be fine.	no
34708	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Hmm.	no
34709	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Hmm, hmm. Yeah - The - the reason why we did it that way, as a - as a reminder, is uh -	no
34710	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And -	no
34711	transcript	transcript_Bed011	no person is gonna	no
34712	transcript	transcript_Bed011	do all of them. They're just gonna select u-	no
34713	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"um, according to their preferences. ""Ah, yeah, I usually visit zoos, or I usually visit castles, or I usually -"" And then you pick that one."	no
34714	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah, yeah.	no
34715	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Right, no no, but - but s- th- point is	no
34716	transcript	transcript_Bed011	They're redundant.	no
34717	transcript	transcript_Bed011	to - to y- to -	no
34718	transcript	transcript_Bed011	build a system that's got everything in it that might happen you do one thing.	no
34719	transcript	transcript_Bed011	T- to build a system that um - had the most data	no
34720	transcript	transcript_Bed011	on a relatively confined set of things, you do something else.	no
34721	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And the speech people, for example, are gonna do better	no
34722	transcript	transcript_Bed011	if they - if - things come up	no
34723	transcript	transcript_Bed011	uh - repeatedly. Now, of course, if everybody says exactly the same thing then it's not interesting.	no
34724	transcript	transcript_Bed011	So, all I'm saying is i- th- there's -	no
34725	transcript	transcript_Bed011	there's a kind of question of what we're trying t- to accomplish.	no
34726	transcript	transcript_Bed011	and -	no
34727	transcript	transcript_Bed011	I think my temptation for the data gathering would be to	no
34728	transcript	transcript_Bed011	uh, you know - And each person is only gonna do it once, so you don't have to worry about them being bored, so if - if it's one service, one luxury item, you know, one big-ish place, and so forth and so on, um -	no
34729	transcript	transcript_Bed011	then	no
34730	transcript	transcript_Bed011	my guess is that - that the data is going to be easier	no
34731	transcript	transcript_Bed011	to handle. Now of course you have this	no
34732	transcript	transcript_Bed011	I guess possible danger that somehow there're certain constructions that people use	no
34733	transcript	transcript_Bed011	uh when talking about a museum that they wouldn't talk about with a university and stuff,	no
34734	transcript	transcript_Bed011	um -	no
34735	transcript	transcript_Bed011	but I guess I'm - I- uh- m- my temptation is to go for simpler.	no
34736	transcript	transcript_Bed011	You know, less variation. But I don't know what other people think about this in terms of -	no
34737	transcript	transcript_Bed011	uh -	no
34738	transcript	transcript_Bed011	So I don't exactly understand - like I- I - I guess we're trying to -	no
34739	transcript	transcript_Bed011	limit the detail of our ontology or types of places that someone could go, right?	no
34740	transcript	transcript_Bed011	But who is it that has to care about this, or what component of the system?	no
34741	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Oh, well, uh - th- I think there are two places where it comes up. One is	no
34742	transcript	transcript_Bed011	uh - in the - th- these people who are gonna take this and - and try to do speech with it.	no
34743	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Mm-hmm.	no
34744	transcript	transcript_Bed011	uh - Lots of pronunciations of th- of the same thing are going to give you	no
34745	transcript	transcript_Bed011	better data	no
34746	transcript	transcript_Bed011	than	no
34747	transcript	transcript_Bed011	l- you know, a few pronunciations of lots more things.	no
34748	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K.	no
34749	transcript	transcript_Bed011	That's one.	no
34750	transcript	transcript_Bed011	So we would rather just	no
34751	transcript	transcript_Bed011	ask - uh have a bunch of people talk about the zoo,	no
34752	transcript	transcript_Bed011	uh and assume that that will -	no
34753	transcript	transcript_Bed011	that the constructions that they use there will give us everything we need to know about these sort of	no
34754	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Bigger -	no
34755	transcript	transcript_Bed011	zoo, castle, whatever type things, these bigger places.	no
34756	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Y- yeah thi- well this is a question for -	no
34757	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"And that way you get the speech data of people saying ""zoo"" over and over again or whatever too. O_K."	no
34758	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
34759	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
34760	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah. So this is a question for you, and, you know, if we - if we do, and we probably will, actually try to uh build a prototype,	no
34761	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Mm-hmm.	no
34762	transcript	transcript_Bed011	uh	no
34763	transcript	transcript_Bed011	probably we could get by	no
34764	transcript	transcript_Bed011	with the prototype only handling a few of them anyway.	no
34765	transcript	transcript_Bed011	So,	no
34766	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Um -	no
34767	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah, the-	no
34768	transcript	transcript_Bed011	this was sort of - these are all different sort of activities.	no
34769	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Um	no
34770	transcript	transcript_Bed011	But I think y- I - I got the point and I think I like it. We can do -	no
34771	transcript	transcript_Bed011	put them in a more hierarchical fashion. So,	no
34772	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"""Go to place"" and then give them a choice, you know either they're the symphony type or opera type or the tourist site guide type or the nightclub disco type person and they say ""yeah this is -"	no
34773	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"on that ""go to big-ish place"", this is what I would do."""	no
34774	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Mm-hmm.	no
34775	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"And then we have the ""Fix"" thing, and then maybe ""Do something the other day"" thing, so."	no
34776	transcript	transcript_Bed011	My question is -	no
34777	transcript	transcript_Bed011	I guess, to some extent, we should - y- we just have to try it out and see if it works. It would be	no
34778	transcript	transcript_Bed011	challenging, in - in a sense, to try to make it so - so complex that they even really should	no
34779	transcript	transcript_Bed011	schedule, or to plan it, uh, a more complex	no
34780	transcript	transcript_Bed011	thing in terms of O_K, you know, they should get the feeling that there are	no
34781	transcript	transcript_Bed011	these s- six things they have to do	no
34782	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Well - yeah.	no
34783	transcript	transcript_Bed011	and they sh- can be done maybe in two days.	no
34784	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Well I think th- th- yeah.	no
34785	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"So they make these decisions, ""Can I go there tomorrow?"" or - you know - influences"	no
34786	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
34787	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Mm-hmm.	no
34788	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Well, I think it's easy enough to set that up if that's your expectation. So,	no
34789	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"the uh system could say, ""Well, uh we'd like to - to set up your program for two days"	no
34790	transcript	transcript_Bed011	in Heidelberg,	no
34791	transcript	transcript_Bed011	you know, let's first think about all the things you might like to do.	no
34792	transcript	transcript_Bed011	So there - th- i- i- in - I mean - in - I th- I - I'm sure that if that's what you did then they would start telling you about that, and then you could get into um various things about ordering, if you wanted.	no
34793	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Mm-hmm.	no
34794	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
34795	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"Yeah, but I think this is part of the instructor's job. And that can be done, sort of to say, ""O_K now we've picked these six tasks."""	no
34796	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"""Now you have- you can call the system and you have two days."""	no
34797	transcript	transcript_Bed011	I'm sorry. No, we have to help - we have to decide. Fey will p- carry out whatever we decide.	no
34798	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And th- w-	no
34799	transcript	transcript_Bed011	But we have to decide	no
34800	transcript	transcript_Bed011	you know, what is the appropriate scenario.	no
34801	transcript	transcript_Bed011	That's what we're gonna talk about t- yeah.	no
34802	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yep, yep.	no
34803	transcript	transcript_Bed011	But these are two different scenarios entirely. I mean, one is a planner -	no
34804	transcript	transcript_Bed011	The other, it kind of give you instructions on the spot	no
34805	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"Yeah, but th- the - I don't - I'm not really interested in sort of ""Phase planning"" capabilities.  But it's more the - how do people phrase these planning requests?"	no
34806	transcript	transcript_Bed011	So are we gonna masquerade the system as this - as you said simple response system,	no
34807	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"""I have one question I get one response"", or should"	no
34808	transcript	transcript_Bed011	we allow for a certain level of complexity. And a- I w- think the data would be nicer if we get temporal	no
34809	transcript	transcript_Bed011	references.	no
34810	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Well, so Keith, what do you think?	no
34811	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Well, um	no
34812	transcript	transcript_Bed011	it seems that - Yeah, I mean,	no
34813	transcript	transcript_Bed011	off the top of my head it kinda seems like you would probably just want, you know, richer data, more complex stuff going on, people trying to do more complex sets of things. I mean  you know, if our goal is to really sort of	no
34814	transcript	transcript_Bed011	be able to handle a whole bunch of different stuff, then throwing harder situations at people will get them to do more linguistic - more interesting linguistic stuff.	no
34815	transcript	transcript_Bed011	But I mean - I'm - I'm not really sure	no
34816	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Uh, because I don't	no
34817	transcript	transcript_Bed011	fully understand like what our choices are of ways to do this here yet.	no
34818	transcript	transcript_Bed011	I mean w- we have tested this and a- y- have you heard - listen to the f- first two or th- as a matter of fact the second person is uh - is - was faced with exactly this kind of setup.	no
34819	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And -	no
34820	transcript	transcript_Bed011	I started to listen to one and it was just like, um,	no
34821	transcript	transcript_Bed011	uh,	no
34822	transcript	transcript_Bed011	sort of depressing.  I thought I'd just sort of listen to the beginning part and the person was just sort of reading off her script or something. And.	no
34823	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Oh, O_K. That was the first subject.	no
34824	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
34825	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
34826	transcript	transcript_Bed011	First one wasn't very good.	no
34827	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
34828	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
34829	transcript	transcript_Bed011	So um, I -	no
34830	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Although -	no
34831	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Um, it is - already with this it got pretty - with this setup	no
34832	transcript	transcript_Bed011	and that particular subject	no
34833	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Mm-hmm.	no
34834	transcript	transcript_Bed011	it got pretty complex. Maybe -	no
34835	transcript	transcript_Bed011	I suggest we	no
34836	transcript	transcript_Bed011	make some fine tuning of these,	no
34837	transcript	transcript_Bed011	get - sort of - run through ten or so subjects and then take a breather, and see whether we wanna make it more complex or not, depending on what - what sort of results we're getting.	no
34838	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Mm-hmm.	no
34839	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Right.	no
34840	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah. It - In fact, um,	no
34841	transcript	transcript_Bed011	I am just	no
34842	transcript	transcript_Bed011	you know - today, next couple days gonna start really diving into this data. I've basically looked at one of the files - you know one of these - l- y- y- y- you gave me those dozens of files and I looked at one of them which was about ten sentences,	no
34843	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"found fifteen, twenty different construction types that we would have to look for and so on and like, ""alright, well, let's start here."" Um. So I haven't really gone into the, you know - looked at all of the stuff that's going on. So I don't really -"	no
34844	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Right, I mean,	no
34845	transcript	transcript_Bed011	once I start doing that I'll have more to say about this kind of thing.	no
34846	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K.	no
34847	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And y- and always -	no
34848	transcript	transcript_Bed011	But well th- but you did say something important, which is	no
34849	transcript	transcript_Bed011	that	no
34850	transcript	transcript_Bed011	um you can probably keep yourself fairly well occupied	no
34851	transcript	transcript_Bed011	uh - with the simple cases for quite a while.	no
34852	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
34853	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Although, obviously th- so - so that sa- s- does suggest that -	no
34854	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Uh, now, I have looked at all the data, and it's pre- it's actually	no
34855	transcript	transcript_Bed011	at least to an amateur, quite redundant. That - that it was - it was very stylized,	no
34856	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah, Yeah.	no
34857	transcript	transcript_Bed011	and quite a lot of people said more or less the same thing.	no
34858	transcript	transcript_Bed011	I um - I did sort of scan it at first and noticed that, and then looked in detail at one of them. But yeah, yeah I noticed that, too.	no
34859	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
34860	transcript	transcript_Bed011	So, we - we - we wanna do more than that.	no
34861	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And with this we're getting more.	no
34862	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K.	no
34863	transcript	transcript_Bed011	No question.	no
34864	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Right.	no
34865	transcript	transcript_Bed011	So -	no
34866	transcript	transcript_Bed011	uh w- do we wanna get going beyond more, which is sort of the -	no
34867	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Well, O_K, so let's - let's take - let's I -	no
34868	transcript	transcript_Bed011	I think your suggestion is good, which is	no
34869	transcript	transcript_Bed011	we'll do a b- uh - a batch.	no
34870	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K.	no
34871	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And, uh, Fey, How long is it gonna be till you have ten subjects?	no
34872	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Couple days? Or thr- f- a-	no
34873	transcript	transcript_Bed011	A week? Or - I don't - I don't have a feel for th-	no
34874	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Um - I can - Yeah, I mean I s- I think can probably schedule ten people,	no
34875	transcript	transcript_Bed011	uh,	no
34876	transcript	transcript_Bed011	whenever.	no
34877	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Well, it's - it's up to you, I mean I j- I - uh- e- We don't have any huge time pressure. It's just - when you have t- Yeah.	no
34878	transcript	transcript_Bed011	How long will it be? Um - I - I would say maybe two weeks.	no
34879	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Oh, O_K.	no
34880	transcript	transcript_Bed011	So let's do this. Let's plan next Monday,	no
34881	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K, to have a review of what we have	no
34882	transcript	transcript_Bed011	so far.	no
34883	transcript	transcript_Bed011	and -	no
34884	transcript	transcript_Bed011	This means audio, but -	no
34885	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Huh?	no
34886	transcript	transcript_Bed011	no transcriptions of course, yeah.	no
34887	transcript	transcript_Bed011	No, we won't have the transcriptions, but what we should	no
34888	transcript	transcript_Bed011	be able to do	no
34889	transcript	transcript_Bed011	and I don't know if, Fey, if you will have time to do this, but it would be great if you could, um,	no
34890	transcript	transcript_Bed011	not transcribe it all, but pick out	no
34891	transcript	transcript_Bed011	uh, some stuff. I mean we	no
34892	transcript	transcript_Bed011	could lis- uh - just sit here and listen to it all.	no
34893	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Are you gonna have the audio on the web site?	no
34894	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K.	no
34895	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Until we reach the gigabyte thing and David Johnson s-	no
34896	transcript	transcript_Bed011	ki- kills me.	no
34897	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And we're gonna put it on the web site. Yeah.	no
34898	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Oh, we could get - I mean, you can buy another disk for two hundred dollars, right? I mean it's - it's not like - O_K.	no
34899	transcript	transcript_Bed011	So, we'll take care of David Johnson. O_K.	no
34900	transcript	transcript_Bed011	No, he -	no
34901	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Take - care of him.	no
34902	transcript	transcript_Bed011	uh, he - he has been solving all our problems or - is wonderful, so s-	no
34903	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K.	no
34904	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Alright. So we'll buy a disk. But anyway, so,	no
34905	transcript	transcript_Bed011	um,	no
34906	transcript	transcript_Bed011	If you - if you can think of a way -	no
34907	transcript	transcript_Bed011	to	no
34908	transcript	transcript_Bed011	uh, point us to th- to interesting things, sort of as you're doing this or - or something	no
34909	transcript	transcript_Bed011	uh, make your - make notes or something that - that this is, you know, something worth looking at. And	no
34910	transcript	transcript_Bed011	other than that, yeah I guess we'll just have to	no
34911	transcript	transcript_Bed011	uh, listen - although I guess it's only ten minutes each, right? Roughly.	no
34912	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Well, I guess. I'm not sure how long it's actually going to take.	no
34913	transcript	transcript_Bed011	The reading task is a lot shorter. That was cut by fifty percent. And the reading,	no
34914	transcript	transcript_Bed011	nobody's interested in that except for the speech people.	no
34915	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Right. No, we don't care about that at all.	no
34916	transcript	transcript_Bed011	So.	no
34917	transcript	transcript_Bed011	It's actually like five minutes dialogue.	no
34918	transcript	transcript_Bed011	I- b- My guess is it's gonna be ten.	no
34919	transcript	transcript_Bed011	People -	no
34920	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Ten minutes is long.	no
34921	transcript	transcript_Bed011	I understand, but people - people - you know uh -	no
34922	transcript	transcript_Bed011	It feels like a long time but.	no
34923	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah. It feels like forever when you're doing it, but then it turns out to be three minutes and forty five seconds.	no

35464	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Right, Right.	no
35465	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K.	no
35466	transcript	transcript_Bed011	We  are  expecting  Johno  to build a parser, but that's a -	no
35467	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yes.	no
35468	transcript	transcript_Bed011	By the end of the summer, too.	no
35469	transcript	transcript_Bed011	No.	no
35470	transcript	transcript_Bed011	No.	no
35471	transcript	transcript_Bed011	No.	no
35472	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Uh -	no
35473	transcript	transcript_Bed011	But it's sort of - it's -	no
35474	transcript	transcript_Bed011	He's g- he's hoping to do this for his masters' thesis s- by a year from now.	no
35475	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Right.	no
35476	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Hmm.	no
35477	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Still, pretty formidable actually.	no
35478	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Eh- absolutely.	no
35479	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Uh - limited. I mean, you know, the idea is - is, Well, the hope is that the parser itself is, uh, pretty robust.	no
35480	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
35481	transcript	transcript_Bed011	But it's not popular - it's only p- only -	no
35482	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Right, Right. Existence proof, you know. Set up the	no
35483	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Right.	no
35484	transcript	transcript_Bed011	It's only popula-	no
35485	transcript	transcript_Bed011	infrastructure, yeah.	no
35486	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Right.	no
35487	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Um sometime, I have to talk to some subset of the people in this group, at least about um	yes
35488	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Um sometime, I have to talk to some subset of the people in this group, at least about um	no
35489	transcript	transcript_Bed011	what sort of constructions I'm looking for. I mean, you know obviously like just	no
35490	transcript	transcript_Bed011	again, looking at this one uh thing, you know, I saw y- things from -	no
35491	transcript	transcript_Bed011	sort of as general as argument structure constructions. Oh, you know, I have to do Verb Phrase. I have to do uh - uh - unbounded dependencies, you know, which have a variety of constructions in - uh - uh - instantiate that.	no
35492	transcript	transcript_Bed011	On the other hand I have to have, you know, there's particular	no
35493	transcript	transcript_Bed011	uh,	no
35494	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"fixed expressions, or semi-fixed expressions like ""Get"" plus path expression for, you know, ""how d- ho- how do I get there?"", ""How do I get in?"", ""How do I get away?"" and all that kind of stuff."	no
35495	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Mm-hmm.	no
35496	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Right.	no
35497	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Um, so there's a variety of sort of different	no
35498	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Absolutely.	no
35499	transcript	transcript_Bed011	sorts of constructions and it - you know it's - it's sort of like anything goes. Like -	no
35500	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K, so this is - I think we're gonna mainly work on with George.	no
35501	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K.	no
35502	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K, and hi- let me f-	no
35503	transcript	transcript_Bed011	th - say what I think is - is - so the idea is - uh - first of all	no
35504	transcript	transcript_Bed011	I misspoke when I said	no
35505	transcript	transcript_Bed011	we thought you should do the constructions. Cause apparently for a linguist that means to do completely and perfectly.	no
35506	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"So what I - yeah, O_K, - So what - what I meant was ""Do a first cut at""."	no
35507	transcript	transcript_Bed011	er - that's what	no
35508	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah, yeah.	no
35509	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K, Because uh - we do wanna get them r- u-	no
35510	transcript	transcript_Bed011	perfectly - but I think we're gonna have to do a first cut at a lot of them to see how they interact.	no
35511	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Of course.	no
35512	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Right, exactly.	no
35513	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Now it - w- we talked about this before, right. And I - I me- it would- it would be completely out of the question to really do more than, say, like,	no
35514	transcript	transcript_Bed011	oh I don't know, ten, over the summer, but uh, but you know obviously we need to get	no
35515	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
35516	transcript	transcript_Bed011	sort of a general view of what things look like, so yeah.	no
35517	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Right. So the idea is going to be	no
35518	transcript	transcript_Bed011	to do - sort of like Nancy did in some of the- er these papers where you do enough of them so you can go from top to bottom - so you can do f- you know,	no
35519	transcript	transcript_Bed011	f- f- uh - have a complete story ov- of s- of some piece of dialogue.	no
35520	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Mm-hmm.	no
35521	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And that's gonna be much more useful	no
35522	transcript	transcript_Bed011	than having all of the clausal constructions and nothing else, or - or - or something like that. So that the - the trick is going to be	no
35523	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah. Sure.	no
35524	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
35525	transcript	transcript_Bed011	t- to take this and pick a - some sort of lattice	no
35526	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Mm-hmm.	no
35527	transcript	transcript_Bed011	of constructions, so- some lexical and some phrasal, and - and, you know, whatever you need in order to	no
35528	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Mm-hmm.	no
35529	transcript	transcript_Bed011	uh, be able to then,	no
35530	transcript	transcript_Bed011	uh, by hand,	no
35531	transcript	transcript_Bed011	you know, explain,	no
35532	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Mm-hmm.	no
35533	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
35534	transcript	transcript_Bed011	some fraction of the utterances.	no
35535	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And so, exactly which ones will partly depend on your research interests and a bunch of other things.	no
35536	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Mm-hmm.	no
35537	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Sure.	no
35538	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K. But I mean in terms of the s- th- sort of level of	no
35539	transcript	transcript_Bed011	uh - of analysis, you know,	no
35540	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"these don't necessarily have to be more complex than like the ""Out of"" construction in the B_C_P paper where it's just like, you know, half a page on each one or something."	no
35541	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Correct.	no
35542	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Oh yeah - yeah. V- a half a page is - is what we'd like.	no
35543	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
35544	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And if - if there's something that really requires a lot more than that then it does and we have to do it, but -	no
35545	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
35546	transcript	transcript_Bed011	For the first cut, that should be fine, yeah.	no
35547	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
35548	transcript	transcript_Bed011	We could sit down and think of sort of the -	no
35549	transcript	transcript_Bed011	the ideal speaker utterances, and I mean	no
35550	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Mm-hmm.	no
35551	transcript	transcript_Bed011	two	no
35552	transcript	transcript_Bed011	or three that follow each other, so,	no
35553	transcript	transcript_Bed011	where we can also sort of, once we have everything up and running,	no
35554	transcript	transcript_Bed011	show the tremendous, insane inferencing capabilities of our system.	no
35555	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Mm-hmm.	no
35556	transcript	transcript_Bed011	So, you know, as - as the SmartKom people have. This is sort of their standard	no
35557	transcript	transcript_Bed011	demo dialogue, which is, you know, what the system survives and nothing but	no
35558	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Mm-hmm.	no
35559	transcript	transcript_Bed011	that. Um, we could also sor- sort of have the   analogen   of	no
35560	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Mm-hmm.	no
35561	transcript	transcript_Bed011	o- our sample sentences, the ideal sentences where we have complete	no
35562	transcript	transcript_Bed011	construction coverage	no
35563	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Mm-hmm.	no
35564	transcript	transcript_Bed011	and, sort of,	no
35565	transcript	transcript_Bed011	they match nicely. So the -	no
35566	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"the ""How do I get to X_?"", you know, that's definitely gonna be"	no
35567	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
35568	transcript	transcript_Bed011	uh, a major one.	no
35569	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah. That's about six times in this little one here, so uh,  yeah.	no
35570	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Right.	no
35571	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yep.	no
35572	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"""Where is X_?"" might be another one which is not too complicated."	no
35573	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
35574	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Mm-hmm.	no
35575	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"And um ""Tell me something about X_."""	no
35576	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
35577	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And hey, that's - that's already covering	no
35578	transcript	transcript_Bed011	eighty percent of the system's functionality.	no
35579	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Ye-	no
35580	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Right, but it's not covering eighty percent of the intellectual interest.	no
35581	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah.	no
35582	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"No, we can w- throw in an ""Out of Film"" construction if you want to, but -"	no
35583	transcript	transcript_Bed011	No, no, no. Well the - th- the thing is there's a lot that needs to be done	no
35584	transcript	transcript_Bed011	to get this right.	no
35585	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K, I th-	no
35586	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K.	no
35587	transcript	transcript_Bed011	We done?	no
35588	transcript	transcript_Bed011	I have one bit of news. Um,	yes
35589	transcript	transcript_Bed011	I have one bit of news. Um,	no
35590	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Good.	no
35591	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Good.	no
35592	transcript	transcript_Bed011	the action planner guy has wrote -	no
35593	transcript	transcript_Bed011	has written a -	no
35594	transcript	transcript_Bed011	a p-	no
35595	transcript	transcript_Bed011	lengthy - proposal on how he wants to do the action planning.	no
35596	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And I responded to him, also rather lengthy, how he should do the action planning.	no
35597	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And -	no
35598	transcript	transcript_Bed011	"""Action planning"" meaning ""Discourse Modeling""?"	no
35599	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yes. And I tacked on a little paragraph about the fact that the whole world calls that	no
35600	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Right.	no
35601	transcript	transcript_Bed011	module a dis- disc- dialogue manager, and	no
35602	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Right.	no
35603	transcript	transcript_Bed011	wouldn't it make sense to do this here too?	no
35604	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And also Rainer M- Malaka is going to be visiting us shortly, most likely in the beginning of June.	no
35605	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Uh-huh, I'll be gone.	no
35606	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yeah. He- he's just in a conference somewhere and he is just swinging through town.	no
35607	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Sure, O_K.	no
35608	transcript	transcript_Bed011	And um -	no
35609	transcript	transcript_Bed011	m- making me incapable of going to N_A_A_C_L,	no
35610	transcript	transcript_Bed011	for which I had funding.	no
35611	transcript	transcript_Bed011	But.	no
35612	transcript	transcript_Bed011	No, no Pittsburg this year.	no
35613	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Hmm.	no
35614	transcript	transcript_Bed011	S-	no
35615	transcript	transcript_Bed011	When is the uh- Santa Barbara? Who is going to? uh- should a lot of people.	no
35616	transcript	transcript_Bed011	That's something I will - would - sort of enjoy.	no
35617	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Probably should go.	no
35618	transcript	transcript_Bed011	That was -  that's   one you should probably go to.	no
35619	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Yep.	no
35620	transcript	transcript_Bed011	How much does it cost?  I haven't planned to go.	no
35621	transcript	transcript_Bed011	There's	no
35622	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Uh,	no
35623	transcript	transcript_Bed011	probably we can uh - pay for it.	no
35624	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K.	no
35625	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Um a student rate shouldn't be very high.	no
35626	transcript	transcript_Bed011	So, if we all decide it's a good idea for you to go then you'll - we'll pay for it.	no
35627	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Right. Sure.	no
35628	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Then you can go.	no
35629	transcript	transcript_Bed011	I mean I - I don't have a feeling one way or the other at the moment, but it probably is.	no
35630	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K.	no
35631	transcript	transcript_Bed011	O_K, great.	no
35632	transcript	transcript_Bed011	Thanks.	yes
